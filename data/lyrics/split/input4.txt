he would always hit me with Gucci belts
Gucci imprint from leather welts

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh-huh, yeah
Ace the Creator, man, ugh
Casey Veggies, yo
Uh-huh, Odd Future, nigga
Get used to, ugh
Let me— Ayy, I'ma slow it down right quick for you
Look

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm so dapper, man, funky-fresh, Dapper Dan
I'm your favorite rapper, fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
On award tour, on excursions
I'm a virgin of swap meets, I'm so pure, so sick, it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?
The hat, the crew, the T-shirt is Supreme
Ugh!

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
And they see me, they play "Pictionary"
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary, my name is by "Fresh"
They at the same spot, they making no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy of a process
Eargasms, they have them
The hotels we staying in twelve-star
Tyler said, "Yo, Casey, just write a twelve-bar"
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh, no
Red and white diamonds, Supreme, box logo

[Intro: Jay-Z]
They don't paint pictures, they just trace me

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking sergeant
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive
'Cause I get it, no charge
And BBC for the low price, no barging, nigga that's a bargain
Cow-print t-shirt like motherfucking dog
On the motherfucking farm with cockadoodle doodles
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the free time, I'm tossing bitches' salads
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flying to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, Baby Milo so dope
The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane
Niggas get the picture, I see, why?
They don't paint pictures, they just trace me

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
My nigga, no hook, and
They don't, paint pictures
My nigga, no hook, and
They don't, paint pictures
My nigga, no hook
They don't, paint pictures
My nigga, no hook
They don't, paint pictures
No hook
They don't, paint pictures
Fuck a hook, man
They don't, paint pictures
Fuck a hook
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, beside me, nobody likes me
Mainly because I am not a fucking HypeBeast
I think Supreme suck, we nollie all our Nikes
I can wear some Wranglers, with a fucking White T
Doo-rags to match, and I do sag, in fact
My hat is in tact with the Fubu pull over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fucking rapper without a chain
With a four-finger ring like I can't spell my fucking name
And I go to Obama rallies screaming out "McCain"
Them ignorant, thrashing motherfuckers is my gang
And the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from
Nigga, you don't claim none, from, I am the teacher
White and black bitch like she's a motherfucking zebra
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator & Jay-Z]
My nigga, no hook, and
They don't, paint pictures
My nigga, no hook, and
They don't, paint pictures
My nigga, no hook
They don't, paint pictures
No hook, and
They don't, paint pictures
No hook
They don't, paint pictures
No hook
They don't, paint pictures
No hook
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
(It's gold) The gold is in the back
(It's gold) The pixels in the front
(It's gold) The beat's a fucking bully
(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, and
(Gold) The pink is in the sky
(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind
(It's gold) The mind is in my gold
The beat is turning old, so go (Yo—yo)

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
(Gold) Synthesizer, I'm the mothafucking master
(It's gold) Nigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys
(Gold) 'Cause the sound lasts longer, bass drum is longer
(It's gold) Than a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga, sound is elastic
(Gold) Nigga, you can't bite this, unless you want to bite back
(It's gold) I didn't take my fucking Rit'lin, this is a hype track
(Gold) HypeTrak, that synth, nigga this is sax shit
I had you motherfuckers eating salad like a fat bitch

[Break: Tyler, the Creator]
Gold
Um...

Uh...
Drop it

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Ace the Creator
O.F.M
Banging on your FM
Ace the Creator
Drop the drums, nigga
Thank you to HypeBeast

[Verse]
I'm the last of a dying breed
Meaning that I’m not afraid to try a new thing
Can't see me, best to get yourself some Visine
Toe tag a motherfucker
No jokes while these other niggas "wakka wakka"
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit? Best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my ThunderCat folder
My cousin was older, my mama used to wake up
Drive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up
Because I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there
Mama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rockbridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne
But really, what I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
'Cause it taught me most important is to do me
'Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
'Cause nobody was jocking my style
'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on her role model shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life, not "I'm On a Boat"
'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
'Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a muh'fuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens, want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, time

[Intro - Trey Songz]
Track’s so phenominal I’m ’bout to spit venom
I’d like to thank Phenom
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Trey Songz]
You see I’m something like a player
But mamma may I
Get down on my knees
And say a prayer
Cos your body’s a blessing
Yeah I love it I want it I need it
And I ain’t happy til I hit it and get it succeed it
You know i’m hungry as a mother f-cker
Would you feed him
I’m on a bad bitch diet
You niggas should try it
Higher than a pilot
Tryna see how high the sky
Get whoever said the sky is the limit’s on some lie shit
Cos i’m looking down at it
You looking ass backwards
Everything I have is everything that he is lacking
Baby you are so attractive
You the baddest
All I wanna know is can I may I have it

[Hook:]
Mamma may I
Can I bite off a lil piece
You look edible to me
I’d like to have you with my coffee, sugar
Mama can I call you Billie Jean
Cos the girl is not my lover but my love is what she needs
May I
Show you what you missing
May I
Girl I know you different
You got me thinking saying baby may I
May I…

[Verse 2 - Fabolous:]
Now I tried to ask politely
Cos they love when I say nice
But that nice shit don’t excite me
She say pull it she say bite me she say grab it hold it tightly
And so rightly I be tryna tear that mother f-cker up
Give it to you rough still be the smoothest around
Feed you Ciroc til the moon start moving ‘em round
You wanna act like a nun I’ma prove that you down
The nuns be them ones you seen that movie The Town
So may I take a couple steps forward
If the bad bitches had a crew you would rep for it
You could give me top quiz girl I’m prepped for it
When them other chicks stopped baby girl just kept going
Dat’s that Energizer bunny put my face in it I'll be Pooh Bear for you honey
Them niggas are a joke I told her don’t be fucking funny
And the kush clouds got the room looking partly sunny

[Hook:]
Mamma may I
Can I bite off a lil piece
You look edible to me
I’d like to have you with my coffee, sugar
Mama can I call you Billie Jean
Cos the girl is not my lover but my love is what she needs
May I
Show you what you missing
May I
Girl I know you different
You got me thinking saying baby may I
May I…

[Verse 3 - Trey Songz:]
Yeah they say I’m rapping like Wayne, Jay and Kanye
Where’s Amber Rose told them I don’t know they
So mind your fucking business I know Trey does
But I would still hit it shit nigga Kanye shrug
Gotta hit a gaylor but my tux don’t fit me
Told my style is get it Taylor baby do it swiftly
Puerto Rican Rum out in Jamaica feeling tipsy
She know i’m doing well I make a fortune so she tell her friends gypsy
Pockets on catch me if you can come and get me
Bitch this is my moment you can catch me on demand
If you missed me from Japan back to Whiff Street
Any place I wanna go what the fuck
AKA for envelope it’s Trigga ‘n’ that’s the way your woman lick me
Life is but a dream man somebody come and pinch me
I am such a feen this rap shit is so addictive
I ain’t even gotta say why it’s over though may I
May I may I

[Intro]
Sometimes, you just gotta —
Go!

[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

[Verse 1]
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't fear it so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Qu'ran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize

[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

[Verse 2]
Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin' it real is not an understood concept
Yeah, complexion's not a contest
'Cause racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called "Conscious"
Everybody rappin' like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor Bloods to attack them
Matter of fact, no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons
Eminem fitted in, but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin' to mimic him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan
The "sounding white" rapper by the name of 50 Cent

[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

[Verse 3]
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be
Now we can do nothing about the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til its all black every-thing

[Hook]
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try, you would never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in them cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man man

[Verse]
My ice cream man, my rubber band man
Like to rock a bandana, and, and
He need an antenna
Way they watch him
He cuter than Santana
Ice cream man, make my ice cream quickly
I'mma let it sit, I like my ice cream slippery
Hickory, Dickory, call me Mike Vickory
I'mma bad bitch, woof woof, I'm so thickory
Can I lick your, can I lick your ice cream cone
Do it like E.T. I make that nigga phone home
I really like vanilla, but my favorite color chocolate
Chocolate, chocolate, gargle it and gargle it

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in them cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man man

[Verse]
My ice cream man, 'cuz I can make him scream
Like a Summer Jam fan. And and he Taliban tan
He fuck with young Nicki, since I came from Band Camp
Ice cream man, make my ice cream quick
They nominate Nick, I like Häagen-Dazs thick
Just put a lot of nuts, I'mma lick it off the tip
I fuck with real thugs, I'm not a Chippendale chick
Now if you see my man, that's my ice cream man
Cuz I never grow up, I'm just like Peter Pan
Baskin Robins, Turkey Hill, Breyers
That other bitch bologna
So I call her Oscar Meyer

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-cherries on the top man
B-butterscotch jam
P-put me some nuts in them cups
That's what's up man
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man man

Such a thug boo
I like your truck too
When I get older I'mma come over and fuck you
'Cuz that's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream
That's my ice cream man

[Intro]
Things take a turn for the worse
Send him back where he came from
We got shots fired down the street

[Interlude: DOOM]
Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then- (Ahem)

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy Federales, yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home, your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice, bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stresses
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood (Villain!)

[Outro]
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cage

[Intro]
(Water splash)
Uh, y'all know what it is
Uh, y'all know what it is
Uh, y'all know what it is

[Verse 1: T-Mo Goodie]
Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it 'til I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade
I know it's through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

[Verse 2: André 3000]
They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming "catch of the day" when the recipe calls for "blackened"
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down and then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

[Verse 3: Khujo Goodie]
I let you stay in my crib
Now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test, the potency
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
"I wish I never did what I did," now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
They got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Ohhh she got away with the boys in the place that really stand a chance.........
Annd he got away with the girls in the back acting like they to hot to dance......

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Welcome to my whirlwind, turn like Tilt-A-Whirls
I be throwing up my set, yes, hurlin' up the world and
Going out, we goin in', say "hello" to my girlfriend
Vomiting and conquering, that C-Class is a "girl Benz"
My class is overseas, I be on "all around the world" rims
Women's international, my will is like my girl then
Goin' in is goin' wild, goin' in is goin' strong
Going for the gold, some world-class goin' in is goin' on
I can do this all day, I ain't got it all, 'kay
They all say I'm one wall short of a whole hallway
One Halls short to keep from coughing all in y'all face
Man, I'm so appalled, I can keep them all safe
I can really ball and put titties all in y'all face
That was Robert Paulson, and that deserves a pausin'
So that's Blart, Pierce, and all that's missing is a bearer
For the coffin that is needed for this beat when I'm done talkin'
Balling in the morning, this feel like my callin'
This the new bitches brew, fall off in my cauldron
Lupe's going crazy! Flow is going almonds
We going back to goin' in, you gonna need a Garmin
Then go and get a car to put your Garmin and my broad in
Destination everywhere, reputation everywhere
Music drop, music stop, one man take up every chair
I know that that ain't very fair how one man take up everywhere
But it ain't for long though, it'll be some closure
Or maybe I'll be everywhere after I'm all over
Say goodbye then start the show, fall on off then start to blow
Acting like I'm rapping, it's that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow
Flow is in the microwave, call it Michael Tyson flow
Killing is a dirty job: Michael Myers, Michael Rowe
Bring it back like Michael Fox, see how far them Michaels go
I feel like I'm Michael Crichton writin' with a microphone
I ain't saying you should die but you should leave your life alone
Maybe borrow one of mine, fast life, life at home
Life is like a box of chocolates, pockets full of Toblerones
Pocket full of wallets so what continent we shopping on?

[Hook: Lil Ronnie]
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)
Don't you hear it screamin'?
This that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, this that Joaquin Phoenix
This that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, this that Joaquin Phoenix
(Don't you hear it screamin'?)
On that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, this that Joaquin Phoenix
On that Joaquin Phoenix, nigga, on that Joaquin Phoenix

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Excuse me, Lupe, "Huh?" This here is your conscience
Supplier of your fire and provider of your content
They really don't want none of you, let's put them in a convent
You are such a handful, you can call us palm prints
They can't get a handle, try to run around my track
And you might get a ham pulled, swag I got a van-full
Plus a motorcycle and a tow truck my sedan pull
I am like a Superman, just without the damn "Youuuu!"
Flow is tied around the track, something like a damsel
Flow is really manly, though, see, that was an example
Remember that for later, though, because I might exam you
Get ready for your tests-s-s, his excellence commands you
See, that's how I get it done: effortless and ample
Means I got a lot of that, no camel toe or Monistat
No pussy in my program...
Worldwide, let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Put in my work and punch the clock like Riddick Bowe's hands
See, my pot is overflowing, can I put some work in your pan?
Yeah, yeah, I am such a dope man
Kitchen's really happy, you should come and see my stove dance
Movie of the week, I call it Beauty and the Beast
And that there's just the kitchen, you should see just where I sleep
Crib is on some other shit, mind is on the mothership
Brain is on my sister boat, thoughts is in my brother whip
Fitted hat is Reynolds Wrap cause I don't trust the government
See, I'm not just touching it, I'm clutching it with oven mitts
Shit get hot, this wristwatch, looks like its a club in it
Like the way I emcee, man, they just be lovin' it
Used to be a pushover, now I'm into shovin' shit
You be on your glory hole, you don't know who you fuckin' with
Stay off in that story mode, I never like a quick game
Came in with a big blast, go out with a big bang
You might catch some whiplash every time I switch lanes
See, I drive a bit fast, nigga kinda insane
Career on stilts, Braveheart: no kilt
You can hear it screaming "freedom" as the beat get killed

[Hook: Lil Ronnie]
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat
I'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
We come through throbbing like thunder storms
Make their feets get wet and funky up in they under arms
I'm too explosive for your ears like I'm throwing bombs
With the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on
Niggas get mad like cheerleaders, they throw they pom-poms
Suck a dick, eat salaam getting they nails done in salons
Hodgy Beats is like lip balm
If you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms
I got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms
Haters must be starving nowadays, I make California Vietnam
And I'm going to embalm my creativity
Into a CD-ROM, so you can feel this shit I'm on

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Bring the keys, yeah!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow bitches (Bring the keys, oh my God!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, nigga, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Could you bring the keys? Yeah!)
Slow it down, slow it down (Turn it up, nigga, where's the bass?)
Slow it down (Drop the drums)

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Pink chinchilla, something like Thriller
My t-shirts are bathing, a bathing gorilla
You niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda
But I ate the whole plate like a fat bitch dinner
I'm never the winner, always the loser
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna
I never use a fork, I always spoon her
Go nuts, instrumental flow much
European model white bitch is eating donuts
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch
Making shit come like I'm Go-Go Gadget
I'm mental, it's instrumental
Make your bitches' therapist ask for dental records
And I hope this record have you stabbing niggas with colored pencils

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Bring the keys, yeah!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow bitches (Bring the keys, oh my God!)
We gon' slow it down, you gon' slow it down (Turn it up, nigga, where's the bass?)
We gon' slow it down for all you slow niggas (Could you bring the keys? Yeah!)
Slow it down, slow it down (Turn it up, nigga, where's the bass?)
Slow it down (Drop the drums)

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo, bubble gum that Reese's Pieces
You fail at life, I'll mug your teachers
I've got Muslims calling on Jesus
I fucked Kelly, where is Regis?
Found Alicia, now she keyless
Cold as ice, and now I'm creamless
Murdered every bod from my squad
So technically, now I'm teamless
O.F. is so prestigious, yeah

My music
My mind
And them three sixes

[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the euphoria of cocaine without Abel
I can make music that makes sense, but not mentally stable
Eighteen, with the whole world in front of me
Odd Future teenagers, nobody can fuck with we

[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)

[Verse 2]
I scream and jump around on couches while you sit and talk
I skip to places, smiley faces, while you fucking walk
My TV stays on Cartoon Network, fuck that "Twilight" shit
You have highlights about your life, I have life 'bout my highlights, bitch
Go to college, get a job, marry, have a kid
Watch them grow, and then you die? No, nigga, fuck the system

[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)
Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)

[Verse 3]
Good kids make bad grown-ups
Stay gold, stray old, maturing means that your life sucks
In my wolf suit, I roam where the wild things at
Still growing, still learning, not knowing that I'm Max
I don't want to grow up, I know that shit for a fact
Nigga, eighteen

[Hook]
Odd (I'm not yet a man)
Future (Still not of a boy)

Gang (Now let's parade in gold)
Odd (I'm not yet a man)

Wolf (This my only joy)
Gang (Now let's parade in gold)

[Verse 4]
They say I'm immature; I say that they depressed
I talk to unicorns; I'm wearing a uniform
Of a nigga that don't give a fuck about time
You live your life all serious while I'm enjoying mine

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator & Dr. TC]
Wow, that's— That's a really good way to look at it
Yeah I mean... I don't. I mean I'm really hyper and everything with my imagination
Ohh okay—ADHD?
I'm not having ADHD like, one second, I'm real hype as fuck, but the next minute, I can just slow that shit down

[Intro]
"Chad Butler, known as Pimp C, died in a Los Angeles hotel room..."
"The L.A. County Coroner's office ruled the rapper's death accidental and attributed it to a combination of..."
"Apnea?"
"Yes"
"And syrup, and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?"
"Absolutely, we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic..."

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sippin' on
He said, "Lean, you wanna hit it, dawg?"
That's the same stuff Weezy's sippin', huh?
And tons of other rappers that be spittin' hard
Yup, he had five up on
Then went and passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter Pink, heard a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sittin' in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimpin' as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hotbox, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddamn, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healin'
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratchin', itchin'
Tryna escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without gettin' nauseous
Room spinnin'
Thinkin' he might have sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed, shut
Sat back in the chair clutchin' that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up
He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinkin' that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us

[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talkin' about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declinin' record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Little Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know 'cause he's my favorite
And I know 'cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit, pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feelin' like a failure
And trust me, it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parents' basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And "weed's not a drug," that's denial
Groundhog Day, life, repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them, we used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheatin' and lyin'
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplyin'
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinkin' I would never do that, not that drug
Growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Lookin' in the mirror like I can't believe what I become
Swore I was gonna be someone
And growin' up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come

[Outro]
"You can tend to, um, go a little too far with some of these things, they have very strong addictive qualities, pills and syrups and whatnot, so um…"
"Is it changing the music?"
"Um, I can only speak for myself personally, you know what I'm saying?
Um, we had been taking down, toning down the content of certain things in the music lately
My new album, of course, probably won't have any references to cough syrup in it
But, uh, it's a little bit more than the music
I think it's gonna start affecting the personal lives of a lot of artists and people..."

André 3000 (Kast!) Shout out to public housing (Bitch! Holla!)
I brought the whole hood with me
You got red dirt in your afro
Young Hov' in the place to be (Yeah, yeah)
OutKast in the place to be

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?
Didn't have to break a steering column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call you (Ugh)
Never judge a person or a book by its covers (Yeah)
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself, boy
Are you Black, white, Asian?
Indonesian or Borean—that's Black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathing
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seeing
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it 'cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power (Power)
The cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height (Ugh)
Because I might just snap on a fuck-ass nigga (Bitch)
Might clap a cap at a sucka-ass nigga
In the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out
He might just pull out his pistol
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kents, you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my mama but Andre is just the same (Ooh)
Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce, dos, deux, a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's and Tuffskins
One minus one; negative one minus negative one is nothing (Ugh)
Busting D-boy raps and player poems
The 'Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd, original material while you bore 'em
Your live show consists of everybody's shit but your-uns
Do your own shit! In your live show (Biting-ass nigga)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
With her Eyes Wide Shut, before I asked to hit her gut
If you brunette, Legally Blonde, I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake and beyond
Antwan raps on, raps on
Clap-off, clap-on
I switch the flow so quick, you cannot fathom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good, but you sound like shit
And your team looking shitty to death

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & Big Boi]
My nigga Big Boi said:
"Watch 'em as they gawk and they gander
You can follow, or lead like Commander Picard
You can have 'The Whole World'
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand!"
This young player's rhyme
I forego'd the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine—Aqueminis
Murderous monster, move minds
Spit it so hard that it oughta be a crime
When you see I'm coming, holla "One-time," holla "One-time"
When you see I'm coming, holla "One-time" ("One-time")

[Pre-Verse: JAY-Z]
Young Hov in the place to be (Woo!)

[Chorus: Big Boi, Sleepy Brown, & Debra Killings]
Don't you like to groove in your hoopty
In your old flip-flops or choose to wear your tennis shoes?
Does it matter to you
That OutKast, we got that skunk for y'all
Keep that pump for y'all

[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
When I'm in the mood I rock the S. Dot tennis shoes
As a interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops
And I fix it up like gin and juice when I'm in them interviews
Dudes wanna know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
"Where the million dollar watch at?" Stop that!
"Why that? Why this?" Niggas wanna hijack the flyness
I'm on a whole 'nother plane (Woo)
A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin' (Ugh)
Understand what I'm saying?
Hov and OutKast, what you think about that?
Really don't matter though what you niggas chatter though
Anybody get out of line, then you trust
That the MAC'll go b-r-r-r-r-ap (Rrrat!)
Got you chilled for that alone
Back on the shit, back on the strip
Another hit, I'm not gon' miss

[Chorus: Big Boi, Sleepy Brown, & Debra Killings]
Don't you like to groove in your hoopty
In your old flip-flops or choose to wear your tennis shoes?
Does it matter to you
That OutKast, we got that skunk for y'all
Keep that pump for y'all

[Outro: Big Boi]
Y-Yeah

[Intro]
Hey, can you turn it up a little bit?
Hold up, yo, Will, your mom's calling
Can I, uh, can I ignore the call?
I can ignore it? A'ight
I'm feelin' a lil' ill right now
And I don't mean ill like, really cool and awesome
I mean like, I'm comin' down with a sickness
(Aha) A'ight, look
Hey

[Verse 1]
Well, I was ridin' in shotgun, speedin' down the highway
Listenin' to music, haven't slept in like five days
I try take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real, I swear to God this shit pretend though
'Cause, me, I get high, make music for a livin'
If that ain’t the best job, then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chillin' for the night, case of Bud Light
Small world for me, but you, you live a Bug's Life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think it's make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine, love it, grimier than rubbish
You softer than a Snuggie and you sweeter than a Sunkist
Never eatin' beets, on your Doug shit
Come with all the swagger, but you lackin' all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school
Spendin' money, drinkin' liquor, naked girls up in my pool

[Chorus]
Wake up in my bed, gettin' head, she said (She said)
The act so cool, but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes (Yes)
Today a new day (New day), a fresh start (Fresh start)
If you didn't make mistakes, you wouldn't get far (Get far)
Life get hard (Get hard), so we get high (Get high)
You ain't shit 'til you try (Try)

[Verse 2]
Ayy
Ayo, my herb smoke tastin' like a Nerds rope
I'ma get rich so I can buy my bitch a fur coat
Somethin' like a millionaire in trainin'
Still my shit amazin', we jumpin' over puddles when it's rainin'
Plannin' on a tan, I'm in the sand
And we'll be jammin', make it bounce
While we dancin' on the clouds until I'm landin' in my house
Remember when my moms would hate me standin' on the couch
But now I'm makin' so much money, I start to lose count
I try and spend it quick, I got bills though
Yeah, I'm only eighteen, I got skills though
Beats, Rhymes, Life, Tribe Called Chill Flow
You been rappin' twenty-five years and you still broke
No disrespect, the riches is the art
I'm just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start
We just do this 'cause we love it and it's settin' us apart
We was already gone while you was only on your mark, hey

[Chorus]
Wake up in my bed, gettin' head, she said (She said)
The act so cool, but she easily impressed
I love to lay back, watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes (Yes)
Today a new day (New day), a fresh start (Fresh start)
If you didn't make mistakes, you wouldn't get far (Get far)
Life get hard (Get hard), so we get high (Get high)
You ain't shit 'til you try (Try)
Life
Looking out the window
Kush and orange Juice nigga
You might want to burn one to this

[Verse 1]
You couldn't walk a mile in these 11 and a halves even if you had a chance
Visions of this cash followed with the thought of the bitch thats chilling at my pad
It’s all part of the plan
To come through get high as I can, party, hit the studio jet lagged
Packing my over night carry on, we don't check bags
Old folks are proud to see I'm young and I Louied up to my eyes
True story word to the wise don't let these labels gas you up to be somethin'
Get yo paper never trust em
Watch the niggas you run with
I done seen niggas who had all they dreams fucked over, over some dumb shit
And make no assumptions hotel owners saying the odors to pungent blame it on the reefer consumption
The difference between you guys is you lie and we live it
In the sky so pay us a visit
Bet yo bitch be trying to kick it

[Wiz Talking]
What you ain't you trying to eat nigga
Come on, fuck is you waiting for
Nigga time just sitting around man. Come on
Everything was all good, now shit real

[Verse 2]
Soon as I enter the room its red carpets and bitches with pretty smelling perfume
Smoking cigars shit was fool
Now you roll hella doobs and anticipate that How Fly 2
Sucker shit we just can't excuse
Steady trying to duplicate but they ain't us
Got bitches dissing they lame ass niggas pot head kids rolling they dank up
Paparazzi taking pictures we famous
Hold my city down like a anchor
Now its champagne we drink
Non-smoking room we just ashen em in the sink
I love her attitude she love tracing my ink
I get up in the wind. Leave her with something to ease stress
The best not just regular visions
Let you get a glimpse of how I'm living, HD
Young Khalifa gettin to the money safe key

[Wiz Talking]
Matter fact hit this
You cold nigga I got a coat in the trunk
Come on man leave that bullshit alone man
Its over for that
Put this coat on

Lie down on the bed, boy, let me light the candles
Uh-uh, don't touch, Yo-Landi just too hot to handle
Blindfold you, lock your hands up with the handcuffs
Even though you lying down, I can make you stand up
Spirits in the room tickle you like a sneaky prawn
Fuck a pen and pad, I write my rhymes with a Ouija board
Draw a pentagram on your chest with my lipstick
Visions in the mirror: heavy Zef futuristic
Let me take your pants off. let's see what you made of
Go through your pockets - no, we not gonna make love
Go through your wallet - woah! look at all this paper!
What a fuckin' sucker. see you later, masturbator

This hostile take over? bow to the fokken master

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Check it out bitch
See sometimes
You gotta realize
Where you are in your life
In order to feel good and I feel good baby
Listen to me

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Walk in the club wit a bunch of thugs
Modify ya brains so they call me drugs
See a hundred girls, get a thousand hugs
One's in my ear talkin' bout her tub
She likes me
She say she needs me
Say she wants me
Cause I'm the shit
Said she likes me
She said she needs me
She wants to see me
Cause I'm the shit

[Chorus]
Now it seems that things are really getting better
In my life
Is it just today or things are really getting better
We'll see tonight
We'll see tonight

[Verse 2: Shay Haley]
Hey little girl wit the tattoo thigh
Baby you look like a slice of pie
Hope my style don't cause you fear
Matter of fact baby, where you goin' from here?
Kiss on me baby
Lick on me baby
But you can't own me baby
Cause I'm the shit
Kiss on me baby
Lick on me baby
But you can't own me baby
Cause I'm the shit

[Chorus]
Now it seems that things are really getting better

We'll see tonight
We'll see tonight

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Check it out now
Don't look at me like "What is up?"
Said I was a nerd but I ain't a punk
If you talk shit be prepared to thump
Plus Terrar's 4/4 is prepared to dump
Watch out boy
Get back then
Watch how you're actin'
Cause I'm the shit
I'm tellin' you watch out now
Tell ya boys to get back then
Watch how ya'll actin'
Cause we the shit

[Chorus]
Now it seems that things are really getting better
In my life
Is it just today or things are really getting better
We'll see tonight
We'll see tonight
Now it seems that things are really getting better
In my life
Is it just today or things are really getting better
We'll see tonight
We'll see tonight
Now it seems that things are really getting better
In my life
Is it just today or things are really getting better
We'll see tonight
We'll see tonight
Now it seems that things are really getting better

We'll see tonight

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]

But bitch you dumb as fuck to right from wrong (Left)

Now Simon says get the fuck out my life
Cause you're not my wife, bitch you're a stand for this night
And you could be a stab for this knife
I'm seventeen ('Teen), you're twenty-six (Six)
You're a divorced slut and you can't suck dick (Bitch)
You dropped outta college, you can't pay shit
But I'm broke as fuck too, bitch, we on the same boat (Float)
Where's my inhaler? I think I'm gonna puke

Bitch, shake your ass (Ass), shake it until the wet sweat
Crawls right down the crack of your ass
Booty meat snackin' (Smackin'), back that ass up
Until you come back up and lick my sack up
I'm Tyler, the Creator
Hang with thrashers and skaters
I do sound like Darth Vader
But that's not stoppin' me from eating your muffin

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
I think you and your friends
Should come with me to get your salad tossed
'Cause when I make this stew in your gold pot
I'm adding extra sauce

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
I got these bitches brewin'
Inside of my gold pots
And there's wet pussy on my face
Shake that ass and don't make vibrations stop
Bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm not a Turtle , I'm a turbo
Haters pray to god that I turn slow
Like I'm sipping on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was something had to work for
But that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect, but lose all my worth, no
You can dead that, get a hearse, go
Don't need 48 you'll find a killer in the first floor
It was me boy, to commercials
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn though
Said that I blew it like Turquoise
Just mad hear it all in your word choice
Know it hurts but I really don't care though
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that ho

[Hook]
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now

[Verse 2]
Oh-oh Go-Go-God over everything-thing
You fly but stars over everything-thing
And I'm one of them, yeah one of th-the-them
Oh I'm not o-o-one? Well I'm a hundred th-the-then
I'm a hundred mother loving stars
You're no lights, you're an undercover car
I'm an ambulance, and a fire truck, and some strobe lights, tied up!
Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mine
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines

[Hook]
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now

[Verse 3]
Ya'll know what I'm a let on
I'm Lupe, yes sir, who they
They yester, and I'm today, and tomorrow, hooray
Can I get a hip-hip for the new K-I-N-G, nigga I-AM-HE
Got the game in the clutch like Iron Sheik
You ball little boy, But I N-B-A
With a hand for the world, you a boy band with a dance and a twirl
I'm a rockstar with a band so thorough
Big ass tour bus that's jammed full of girls
T-t-tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof
T-t-tell em what it do, I don't care about your curfew
I'll tell you when I'm through boy

[Hook]
I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now

[Outro]
Tell em what it do, yell it from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
Tell em what it do, holla from the bottom, yell it from the roof boy
I don't wanna, I-I don't wanna, I-I-I don't wanna
C-c-c-care right, c-c-care right now
I don't wanna, I-I don't wanna, I-I-I don't wanna
C-c-c-care right, c-c-care right now

[Intro]
I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now, you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

[Interlude]
Haha! Haha, haha, haha!
Alright look
I'ma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

[Verse 1]
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove
I was even worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 2]
Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Verse 3]
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Ca$his, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes, I feel like it's just me
Sometimes, I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

[Outro]
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!
Balalalalalalalalalala
Cuckoo, cuckoo, tweet

[Intro]
Stop that, stop the madness! I rap off the dome! Let's do it
Just make sure the beat is... in the room. Make sure it's... it sounds good for me, yep

[Verse]
First thing's first, if I ever curse, since my birth
Came through the room, had to rock shit all day
If I'm in the tomb, mothafuckas' better give me room
I'm fighting with the demons 'til im done dude
While I consume the Henny
Work for every penny I'ma grinder
Ask about a nigga and your girl, I will find her!
Yeah, the Jesus piece blind her
Yeah, check the baby girl, right, I'm behind her
Ask what she wanna do?
If she wanna sip and dip?
If she wanna roll baby, girl we can do it, biatch!
I'ma show you 'bout the Double O'
Show you 'bout Cleveland City
Show you how da grind go
Hey! Baby girl wanna meet Yeezy?
Come ride in the Benzy
We gon' take a ride, we gon' ride down in Hollywood
Holla' at me homeboy like it's Hollygood
Yeah, I wish you would get outta' line!
Never "Chris Brown" a ho, but I'm on the grind
Lemme' tell you 'bout the "New Shit!"
Kid Cudi in the game, mothafucker you should know it, biah!
I'm on my mothafucking V.I
Ask about a nigga, yeah came in so shy
Now I'm so fly with my Bathen Apers
Most people know the game 'cuz we paper chasers
While I'm sitting back, chopping it up in Japan
With Nigo in the van
And we rollin' like Damn!
And recipt that!
The camo' is hiddin
You see it with your glasses
Magnifyed for sizzle
If you see me with Snoop
We will be all in the coupe
And we smoking the kush
'till we up in the booth
Yeah V.I.P. is where you find me
But I be- the coolest mothafucka' "G" in the street
Not a "G", as in gangster, I'mma "G", as in grinder
Y'all niggas know the game, man the flow is a shiner
Shining like a star, or riding past a cloud
I scream Kid Cudi!
I scream the shit loud
'Cuz I'mma put it down from here to Chatanooga!
Mah' Cleveland City representers rollin' with them Moovas'
The niggas down in Cali', they roll up in a Bently
We show them what these niggas gotta grind for every penny
Hey, hey, hey, all off the dizome, all off the dizome, all off the dizome!
Shout to Busta Rhymes, shout out to Jayda, shout out to Jeezy, see you on the block man!
Holla' atta' nigga! Lemme' know whas' good
If you need a hook or verse, Kid Cudi is the goodness
Oh mah' gooooodness!
That's some goooood shit!
Mothafuckas' need to know I spit goooood, bitch!
I'm, I'm not a gimmick, niggas need to turn it up, mothafucka' please listen!

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm extra good. Stop playing games! I'm here, I'm not joking this is a real movement...(echoes)

[Hook]
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together

[Verse 1]
Started from nothing, ended up with everything
From the house, to the whips, taking trips to any place that you care to name
Champagne, skydivin'
EZ wider papers, no blunts, hit it once you mile high
Grindin' now I'm livin' how I'm supposed to
Laughing at you haters like I told you, told you
I just tell the waitress keep pouring
Get in front of the camera keep posing
Too much bank to be rolled in, that's why I stay golden, till the cake gets swollen
And you just can't fold it, or it's old and molded
And the crust get golden

[Hook]
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together

[Verse 2]
You stay the night cause you say my life is exciting
Wake up still drunk not going to work cause you like it
Livin' with no regrets
Buyin' more bottles while we got ones I ain't even opened yet
Notice that first thought you wanna talk about your boyfriend, boyfriend
Now everytime he callin' you ignoring them, ignoring them
Somewhere tasting trees
Cat and mouse
You chase me I'll chase this cheese
While we're young, one

[Hook]
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together
We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 1]
Hey, I can’t be mad at what got me ahead
I don't regret my ghetto struggle due to my success
It ain't that beautiful to write on overcoming stress
Top Ramen noodle soup, thank pappy for the fact I was fed
Look at me now but all before, "Hey Mr. Skid Row"
The dirty south ain’t just a name the way I’ve been poor
The projects brown and white, I call it gizmo
Went from a gremlin' to them cars in Jigga's video
Can’t find a meal to a mil, only God know it
No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it
Can I live too? I’m living like my Momma told it
Before you reap it, gotta sew it

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 2]
Hey, still on my Kunta Kinte
Somebody had to bleed just for me to get away
My sister had to leave, I respect her staying safe
Oh yeah, I had to grieve, but I’m stronger to this day
Pain, I can't ignore it, you might say I'm ignorant
I’m mistaking for courage, victory so gorgeous
Make it through two Bush, I can make it through any forest
Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important
37 ave and 187 street
Miami, Carol City, now I’m part of a legacy
I’m thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy
There’s only five letters really help me

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 3]
Hey, I know the seeds been planted
It’s damaging my soul, but my dreams been granted
That triple life towards, much deeper than Earth's planet
What could I want more than redoing? I never panic
Gets no lower than the ground beneath your feet
A man will stand for nothing if he falls for defeat
A boulder in the hand better than all in the street
If you look beneath the sand, then we all need a crease
Roots before the branches, roots before the mansions
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson
Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas
Roots whether you black, white, or Spanish

[Chorus]
I’m talking 'bout roots
I can't hate where I'm from
'Cause where I'm from made me
I came from the bottom of the slums
But now I got me... me
That’s because of my roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I’m talking 'bout roots

[Verse 1]
Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than seventeen in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walkin' down the mean murk, where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga
Even if you tryna' get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smirk, he smiled back
He remembered this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialed back
How niggas do, he kept it movin', couldn’t wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon' save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he’s fading out, the favorite child
He’s fading out (the favorite child)

[Verse 1]
All night, I've been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too wide open, there's nothing I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Verse 2]
Uh, I wish I wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Outro]
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
'Cause I used to love her hooters now Carmen Electra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krueger
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew 'cause...

[Hook 2: Eminem & B.o.B]
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
With the soul of a Shaman
I'll eat a beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It’s probably got diseases on it
I’m just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
Somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin’ back watching Earth from my Space station

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a muthafucking icicle i'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
("He can’t say whore"), of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

[Intro:]
This one for my baller niggas
That hate when the weakest ho in the club try to approach him
Some songs the ladies love me
The girls gon' hate me for this one
But I gotta do it
Come on

[Hook 1:]
Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?

[Verse 1:]
She asked
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
No, that's a niche
Rock Clavin Klein
So she can see K
I'm still doing 120 on the freeway
She still got a prom picture in her key-chain
I told her look
This ain't high school no more
I'm tryin'a fuck being cool no more
So niggas go ball
Just to perform
Cause all these rats be talking up a storm
I know what they worn
I know what they be liking
If they hair short
Said "They probably be dyking'"
Probably a drying
Probably you like it
I can't know what
You're probably a psychic
I know a crazy bitch by the look in her eyes
I know a cheating bitch gonna look at my guys
I know a fat bitch gonna look at them fries
Tell me on the side like
"Can I supersize?"
Got my meat in my ride
Go down while I drive
Some hoes ain't for show
You just keep 'em inside
Call 'em at 3 AM and get deep up inside
Blow me and my homie, when you see me you don't know me
You heard?

[Hook 2:]
Bitch, do I look like your type?
Don't get me wrong, you still gotta look cool to me
Bitch, do I look like your type?
This ain't a song I made for ugly hoes to start approaching me

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2:]
Woah
She
Rock the jeans above the knees
Oh them must be some kid capris
So I spend cheese
Urp!
Bitch please
Your girlfriend ain't tell you 'bout me
Kanye fuck 'em and leave 'em
Act like he don't need 'em
See titties and squeeze 'em
For no fucking reason
"Ugh, he's so classless grabbing asses
How would you do a nerd bitch with glasses"?
Pimp nigga never spent no dough on a booty
I wish I would take this fat hoe to the movies
Them niggas must not know the price of the Coogi
I'ma little too rich to fuck this broke bitch
The survey says: "By the streets according
Kanye more important than Michael Jordan
Got this rap game locked, you could call the warden
Give hoes cock then I'm gone by morning

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Verse 3]
Damn I was wrong..how could I stoop so low?
Pull up in a four door volvo
Dropped the top and swooped yo hoe
Woah..oh no
I don't want no wild body bitch in my wild body 6
No fucking weak hoes in my fucking Regal
No bitch that's whack in my Cadillac
No bitch with a fade in my Escalade
No sluts with a gut in my Beamer truck
No ? in my gold Jaguar
Deep voice bitches like "{vocalizes deep murmurings}"
"I never thought Kanye would take it this far!"

[Outro]
Remember back in high school?
Like prom queen, right?
She was like 37-25-36
Now she 37 with 25 kids
Ya' know what I'm sayin?
Now she on the come up
Tryna get a baller nigga
Bitch heard my song on the radio
She heard me on the Jagged Edge shit
Memorized my cell phone number out the blue
Called me on some..
"I wasn't sure if that was you or not"
Bitch you ain't hear me say Kanye Titter at the beginning?
Gold digging bitch

[Intro]
Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh

[Hook]
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you

(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yea; You gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 2: Drake]
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; Its a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; Ho!)
I know that out there, theres a few
(I know that they out there man)
See I've been searching, I dont know what to do
(Ho! You gotta help me man)
Can you help me?
(Uh)
Special
(Uh; yea; I need you to hold me down babe)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
Gotta be special
(Yeah; You never really know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh
(Yep; ho!; Were makin history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; Yea; I know they out there man)
I know that out there theres a few
(Ho!; Yeah uh)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
(You gotta help me baby)
Can you help me?

By that I mean that you gon hold me down

Cause you never know how people stick around

Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah

[Chorus]
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me

All I wanna do is give you all of me now

Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life

Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be making me moist
Giving me head while she humming, she can play with her voice
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass
She could ride a dick too, make me cum fast
I like them modeling bitches, I love them swallowing bitches
Where them hoes headed at? I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Baby named me, Fire Wayne, Ice and Change
You can catch me in an aqua range, squatting things
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades
Diamond face, diamond brace
More colors than the game Simon Says
Go, 'hind me
And mami on forty-fifth she told me "I'm a lez"
And she ain't like too much of dick
But give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got a Phantom, don't need your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin'
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, y'all already knowin'
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin'
See I'm a keep it going, Big Tymin, you heard's me?

Wait, I don't think they heard me

Come through on dub-deuces, they jock me dog
Glock cocked for haters tryna block me dog
Catch 'em solo, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way
And let B.G. ease down the shinin' linen
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't wanna put your vehicle next to us
Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up
With television, Dreamcast, DVDs
Nice sounds, buttons, it's twenties
I'm a Cash Money Hot, Big Tymer nigga
That'll hold a pinky finger up and blind ya nigga

Nigga like me stay in the cut twenty-four/seven
Steady stacking my ends on dubs, twenty-four/seven
Every car you wish you had, we got it, we got it

Love to floss, no secret stunners
Niggas steady baller block, can't take nothing from us
Young nigga, living a life surrounded by ice
Hoes be like, "Damn, them boys, they're nothing nice"
They on fire, that must be them Hot Boys
You motherfucking right, you think this not girl?
Better think twice, get it right dog
Know you recognize, we got it on lock fall

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
(Shine) - From my head down to my shoes
(Shine) - Skritin' on twenty-two's
(Shine) - Check my baby mamma
(Shine) - Whip Rovers, not Hondas
(Shine) - I'mma spend it 'til it's gone
(Shine) - Don't know when I'm coming home
(Shine) - Pop X and drank Cris'
(Shine) - My life is the shit
(Shine) - From my head down to my shoes
(Shine) - Skritin' on twenty-two's
(Shine) - Check my baby mamma
(Shine) - Whip Rovers, not Hondas
(Shine) - I'mma spend it 'til it's gone
(Shine) - Don't know when I'm coming home
(Shine) - Pop X and drank Cris'
(Shine) - My life is the shit

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Huh uh (oh shit)
2001 - my life is the shit, know why?
(Lemme see that)
(Im gon' shiiiiii-neee)
I'm representing, I'mma spit it (bling)
As long as they make that shit - I'mma break that shit
Ya heard me? It's like that; believe that
This year; fuck it - I said it before and I meant it
I'm buying me a city
New Mannie, Louisiana - ya bitch yooou!

[Verse 1]
I think I started something
I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste?

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes, pacin' in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on movin'
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin' I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smokin' anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste?

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

[Bridge]
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, ohh
Novacane, novacane-cane

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids
We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off
Of a dying world
And millions are left behind
While the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye
Goodbye

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

(*alarm clock*)

[Verse 1]
She was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil
Now I’m left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How bout I make it metal
I’m such a fatal fellow
And shes the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I’d die
I’d die, I’d die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I’ve buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake

But you love me
At least thats what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red
But she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

[Verse 2]
I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I’m losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I’m supposed
I’m attacking my own soul
I’m back in a lone mode
I’m back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She’s on top, she wanna kiss
She won't stop, she don’t wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever

[Refrain]
She loves me, she loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love

And I don’t want love, I don’t want love
I don’t wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She’ll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guilty

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I got my capital S-W-agger up
You dig?
Young Money Cash Money DipSet Byrdgang
We a team baby (Freekey!)
Welcome to DipSet, baby

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Okay, my leather so soft but don't think I ain't hard
Bitch say Weezy make it rain, I say bitch I ain't God
But I am God's son, but you know I ain't Nas
See, he got a positive aim, and I aim nines
Man, little Weezy got a style that even I can't find
Man, some shit just be so hard, I be like that line ain't mine
And if that is under a gram, then that line ain't mine
And if you niggas talking war, well bitch, it's combat time
Hey, I take three l's to the head: Love, Live, Life, and I'm dead
Young Money, Dipset, that's what this is
And if I ain't good looking, you can bet my bitch is
I done made it off Apple Street like it was 2300 Jackson Street
Young Money, can't join 'em nor beat 'em
Where the fuck is Robin Leach when you need him?
A rich nigga can't even buy freedom
That's why I give my white bitches everything but freedom
I do my white bitches anything but beat 'em
And if they like rat poison, then I'mma feed 'em
I'm sophisticated, fresh from Antarctica my wrist just made it
I'm rich bitch, I ain't broke no more
But I will still chop you up and feed your ass to the poor
I'm 'bout my cream like a s'more
You old ass rappers better stay on tour
You're like 44, I got a 44, I'm 24
I could murk you and come home when I'm 44

[Chorus]

[Verse 1:Kid Cudi]
Wow this career is so so commercial
I would say no
More after school special
Another story about an unruly teen
Become a triumphant
More than what it seemed
All of the glorious things that he dreamed
Made the life that he saw seem so sub par
A star that was shooting didn’t seem too far
All he needed was some rockets on the side of a car
Maybe a little weed to intensify the scene
To provide a solid answer to the question “why I lean?’
A bonafide fiend that be taking by the beams of light
Man on the moon ain’t a name it’s a way of life
And this is why I got hated
Until I found myself and embraced it
Its something I denied
Why lie to my soul
Truth be told…

[Hook]
Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
Oh no
These niggas thought I was capped
Until they open their eyes
And see what finally happen for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I’m just a dreamer
Turned true to life leaner
Born to do good
So others can be believers
Once had a lover, but I had to leave her
My life is much bigger
The plan I mean
Its all set in motion, the plan I’ve seen
Couldn’t figure out my purpose till the sky changed scenes
While them other niggas ride watching screens
I was getting off of work daydreaming all alone
Daydream till I’m home
In my bed in my zone
Nobody would call
Not a ring on my phone
Raps so boring
I can’t buy ringtones
I’d rather have the Nokia alert
I’m so gone
Man I’m never alert
But I feel so good
No more hurt
I’m whole completely complete
Rainy days completely delete
I see…

[Hook]
Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
Oh no
These niggas thought I was capped
Until they open their eyes
And see what finally happen for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why (why)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
It's young Khalifa, man
My weed good
Fingernails clean now
I don't do nothing but peel money and touch bitches
(Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard)
So tell 'em go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
So that's what I'ma do, hahaha
Yeah
(Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard)
Juliano on the track
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I worked for everything I own
Dare a nigga try and take it
Spent 300 on the frames
Just for blocking out you haters
Swear they're in my way
They in my rear view mirror
If a nigga act stupid
I'mma let him get his issue
Everything designer
And my back seats recline
I got a thing for livin' good
And blowing money like it's tissue
But niggas see you eating
Get to starving for a plate
Well, you don't give it when they hate
That's why my niggas keep a biscuit
It's no gimmick
I talk it how I live it
So when nigga cross the finish
Gotta push it to the limit
Got a mom and little sister
I plan on taking care of
Lost my uncle this year
A couple niggas in the system
So I roll
No telling where I'm landing
But I know something
That I'm going towards some money
I can see you niggas slacking
Everyday I'm on my job
Young Khalifa going hard
'Til the I'm last man standing

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
I ain't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
Go hard or I'ma go home
And I ain't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Got my eyes on this money
And some good weed burning
Where I'm from you gotta grind
Going hard is not an option
Now these niggas acting jealous
Cause they feel like they ain't shining
And they little shit stop
When this big shit popping
Probably be a fiend
Gotta keep it in my system
60-box of cigarillos
Cause I blow it by the onion
Pay a couple bills
Send some paper to my young'n
'Cause he just like Steve Francis
He be playing with them rockets
Whipping on the wheel
Got my peddle to the metal
'Bout to hit another city
Ain't no point in getting settled
Straight onto the plane
Ain't been home in so long
Niggas think it's my cologne
But that's money that you smelling
I act like my father
Can't stand my older brother
Got some niggas doing years
Cause of funny niggas telling
Nigga, I'm a keep grinding
'Til the day that I expire
I be running through the fire
'Til I'm the last man standing

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye
Tell 'em, go home cause I'ma go hard
I'ma go hard or I'ma go home
I haven't been there you know in so long
So goodbye

[Verse 1: DMX]
You still right here shorty, told you I got you
Like the way I scooped you when them faggot niggas shot you
I'ma hold you down and I mean that for real
But every time you beef with a nigga, I end up havin' to kill
It ain't like that, and hey, forget about them two kids
'Bout to get a deal and it's as nice as you is
Oh, you think? — Nah, I'm just playin', wassup?
Got some new bitches, I know you tryna fuck
Not really — What, I ain't your man no more?
Just because a nigga don't need a hand no more?
You know how we do, if one goes soft
We all take the pussy and go up in her raw
It's like now, where you goin', I ain't tryin to take it
Fuckin' with a nigga like you, I won't make it
It'll be what it is... — Yo, you in for the night?
I'm 'bout to take it to the crib — You get home, aight?

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
The snake (Snake), the rat (Rat), the cat and the dog (Dog)
How you gonna live when you're in the fog?
The snake (Snake), the rat (Rat), the cat and the dog (Dog)
How you gonna live when you're in the fog?

[Verse 2: DMX]
Yo, I ain't fuckin' with this nigga no more, word to my mother
Fuck it, so you know I'm for sure, word to my brother
It's like he's gotten worse than before, son of "I wonder"
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under?
Then I get the call: "Yo?"
"X! Police just killed your cousin, underneath the projects
Don't get vexed, niggas'll pay, 'member I got you
Told you I got you; Dawg, I got you!"
I'm in a catch twenty-two, but them niggas got to pay
But I know he gon' be askin' for a favor one day
But fuck it, I ain't got no choice in the matter
Them faggots killed my peoples, and I wanna see 'em splatter
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, we ain't on no kid shit
And I'ma use the same gun that you killed them two kids with
Is that hard to live with? — Nah — See, you still a playa
But what you want from me? — Ahh, I'll tell you later

[Chorus: Marilyn Manson]
The snake (Snake), the rat (Rat), the cat and the dog (Dog)
How you gonna live when you're in the fog?
The snake (Snake), the rat (Rat), the cat and the dog (Dog)
How you gonna live when you're in the fog?

[Verse 3: DMX]
Shit is all over the news: 'Bomb goes off in Central'
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?
The mental is like, "Get the fuck outta there!"
I'm out — Hey, goin' somewhere?
Nah — What's the bag for? — Fuck it, what you want?
Can your nigga come inside, for a minute and puff a blunt?
Here we go again... — After what I just gave you?
Wasn't actin' like that, when you asked for that favor
Yo, I ain't asked you for shit! — Oh, yes you did!
When you really needed somethin' then you allowed me to give
You sold me your soul when you didn't say no
Just let a nigga go; now gimme what you owe!
Fuck were you thinkin'? Ain't shit for free!
Ain't a motherfucker you know can defeat me!
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned
And with your help, I know the Devil won't win!

[Bridge: Marilyn Manson]
(Kill, kill, kill, kill; X, X, X, X)
Take you all on a way to hell
(Kill, kill, kill, kill; X, X, X, X)
We know what to do, we do it well
(Kill, kill, kill, kill; X, X, X, X)
Take you all on a way to hell
(Kill, kill, kill, kill; X, X, X, X)
We know what to do and we do it well

[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12-gauge shotty (Feel me!) (Come get me)
And Ja said he shall be (Motherfuckers if you want Shady)
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac (If Pac was still here now)
To lead this industry into the ways of the man (He would never ride with Ja)
Follow me! (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Keep my mesh vest as Pac's vest

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you muthafuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In The Source, stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to God, hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me, oh my god, ma—my position
No one'll pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
And now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' madman who screams
Like I'm Pac, but I'm not, enemies, Hennessey
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' muthafuckas names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucka

[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
Motherfucker if you want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Get off that E
'Fore you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell, G-Unit muthafucka, we ballin'
Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', can you accept my call
C.O. let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Muthafuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a muthafuckin' punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with your ugly ass mug (Ha-ha-ha)
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don’t play that
All these old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man (Ha-ha)
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryna play hate on my shit, man, eat a fat dick
Lovin' this shit that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy (Uh-uh)
Against all odds, hopin' my thug muthafuckas know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involvin' me for
It's been a long time comin', like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
It's kinda funny, wannabe Pac, wanna fake like you thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc. roster
Dumbass, now who's shootin'? Ah made you look
You said Bus singin' the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shootin', I take a look at your man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga, start adjustin' your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
I think about the game and what it's like and what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't tryin' to repeat this
Just cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Oh shit, it was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue, homie
Now I'ma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One

[50 Cent]
Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes too big for you to walk in you lil' faggot, hahaha

(What do we have here now?)

Uhh, let's be honest, 'cause truthfully
At the rate I'm moving, you gon' have to get used to me
This sauce is the weakest, tang and my three step
Often rejected 'cause I reject the reject
Garage band flow needs no reasoning
Y'all niggas tasteless, beef no seasoning
C4's eating them proceed to the exit
Ends with a L-Y, starts with an S, yes
Him without a win is Clark Kent without a cleft chin
Superman reference of how high I keep stepping
Whoa, I go harder than standardized testing
Bars on lock my development's arrested
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos
Yeah, yes, impressive y'all steady coming in second
Fuck V-necks, I'm the rapper to invest in
My flow ends recessions, I'm fresh as Crest breath is
Okay, I'm tryna tell you I'm superior
Cardiac flow what you're hearing in my material is heart
Covered in ego, I freeze emcees zero degrees below
When it's comes to alter-ego's, I got at least four
But they the reason why I'm always ready, listo
Aight I'm Sly-lingual, eyes on the prize, I'm fly make eyes twinkle
I been dope, put it on your grandmother's wrinkles
Chip on my shoulder like I'm dieting with Pringles
I brush it off quick like H to the O-V
Life is but a beach chair beach nigga's folding

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
American love
American me
American you
American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far" (Oh)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
And nigga, if I did it, I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
These niggas can't do nothin' that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do

[Intro]
Haha
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like...

[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun"

[Pre-Chorus]
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

[Chorus]
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me..."

[Post-Chorus]
You'd be singin' to her
Like, "La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da"

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

[Chorus]
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Okay, I don't believe it"
I say "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
(Ooh, ooh, ah) Ooh, ah
Yeah
Fair enough

[Bridge]
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half
Ah, ah
I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" ‘bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, "La-da, da-da" 'bout love lost

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Damn
Haha
I'm saying though, like...
All I write is love songs
I mean, I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were...
Might bug with it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when the tears have run out
We'll be numb and blue, blue

[Refrain: Mr. Hudson & Frank Ocean]
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream, dream, dream
I still dream, dream (There will be)

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See, I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon, he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face
Can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well, I can
I'm sad and

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
There will be tears, I have no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
"I can't be there"
That's all you had to say to me was you couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me you won't be there?
You coulda warned me you wouldn't be here
Right here, you wouldn't be here for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Hook]
Silver dollar fresh I stay
I’ll be fresh all day, yeah yeah
Silver dollar fresh I stay
I’ll be fresh always, yeah yeah
(repeated)

[Flo Rida: Verse 1]
Money in my pocket
He be talking I be quiet
There they go again smelling like I wanna buy it
Shawty think I'm fresh I make em wet like fire hydrant
I be on that fly shit go from passenger to pilot
Point it out like gimme that
Point it out like gimme that
Point it out like gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Why do I be stuntin’ to be honest I don’t know
Hundred after Hundred I don’t know
I love it l-l-l-l love it I got a problem
Its nothin’ nothin nothin nothin I'm poppin collars
Last week I flossed on em, bitch I made a movie
How you doin? Where you been? Hello to my groupies!
Swagga to the moon man, Gwap in my two hands
You can eat the fruit loops wrist full of Toucans
All types of colors, We family like brothers
My cash in my clean can't have one without the other
I stay

[Chrous]

[Lil Wayne: Verse 2]

Man I got bitches in my home
And bitches on my phone
I’m like can you call me back because SportsCenter is on
I don't mean to come off wrong
But man my money long
I say man my money long
Call me Stretch Armstrong
Big ass chain on my junk yard dog shit
Viagra swagga, fuck all yeall shit
Haha, mike stop the beat
Hear the money talk and it talking about me
White boy fresh…skinny ass pants
But I ball hard like scouts in the stands
I just sit around my house blowing ounce like a fan
I flip one of these niggas like Jackie Chan
I ain't worry bout em
I just ball out, Man I'm too cold lemme thaw out
Im so Young Money… I got dumb money
Beau-coup bread but a bitch can’t get a crumb from me

[Hook]

[Flo Rida: Verse 3]
Money in my pocket he ain't coming back to life
I gave her CPR blow thirty shooting dice
I’m married to the cash like somebody throwing rice
And I'm married to the cash I just had to say it twice
Tell me I ain't stuntin nah
Tell me I ain't stuntin nah
Tell me I ain't stuntin nah, nah, nah, nah, nah..
Put on for my city and I do it like I’m supposed to
Ballin’ like when Britney cut her hair I cut the checks fool
I do that d-d-d-do that im about my buisness
Like who that who-who-who that pushin the Bentley
Everybody staring thats Mister Mclaren
Loco con dinero like-like I was speaking spanish
Shine like a Disco
Dimes think its Crystal
Said she gotta twin then you know I’m callin Brisco
I ain't drink that Dom-P
I ain't drink that Dom-P
Them shawties spill my bottle on my Parlay Adore jeans

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain’t no mystery why there picking me for
I’ve been hot since ’97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I’m skinny, didn’t eat so I’m hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it’s funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn’t get on
One time for my city bitch I’m putting it on
Like a condom when I’m with your girl, ballin’ like it’s intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin’ to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn’t nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn’t make it past flirting
Now I’m taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
"Make It Last Forever" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast’es
I never disrespected, I’m clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don’t wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin’ like him
And hope he fucking wife em

[Break]
Yeah, nuttin’ like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin’ jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can’t impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y’all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don’t care to see
Don’t make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I’m the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don’t wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I’m dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y’all gotta shed me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yeh

[B.o.B - Verse 1]
Soon as I enter, you know who it is-a
It’s the representer from the east-side of Atlanta
That’s known as Decatur
I got my own lane, but I can’t see the road
My rear view mirror’s full of haters
Wouldn’t wanna be ya, it's me they cannot battle
Yes I’m a mothership and you a boat without no paddles
Yes I am what they after, I’m a natural born disaster
I’m the reason your momma tell you not hang with rappers
But your momma is a minister and I'm her favorite rapper
Probably cause she found out that my daddy was a pastor
I wonder what she’s after, but don’t get it confused
There's no surprise, it’s just another day in my shoes

[Hook: B.o.B]
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It’s just a different day with the same shit
It’s just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
Yeah, well these niggas salty, high blood pressure
Well if you got that sodium, nigga I got that pepper (Dr. Pepper)
Don’t step up, please fall back
Y’all can’t ball, all y’all are whack
Haters need hugs, you thugs need love
And groupies fall in holes that gold diggers dug
These niggas cynical cause I’m on that medicinal
Why they so sensitive? I guess they on their menstruals
I don’t need no, come consider the general
Regardless of my genre, yes, I’m flawless, man, in general
When I’m in the club, girls be jigging on they tippy toes
So she take me in like her vitamins and minerals
You ain't on my signal, you analog or digital
Grand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on
When my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up
I am a bomb
Leaping over barriers like this was a triathlon

[Hook: B.o.B]
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It’s just a different day with the same shit
It’s just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know

[Donnis - Verse 3]
Now I’m the everyday topic
Under a microscope so now I’m feeling microscopic
My shit was fading to black, niggas thought I was gothic
But made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics
I bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics
Ain't "Nuthin' But A G Thang", nigga I’m the king of pain
Veins filled with Novocaine, so I ain't even feeling y’all
I ain't even hearing y’all, fingernails on a blackboard
They say the pen is way mightier than the sword
So I’mma spaz out to get inside the mental ward
Then get my Grammy awards
'Til your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit
Niggas got it backwards, let's line up all the factors
Grew up in the hood, but was raised in the 'burbs
Where pops wasn't there so the military made me a man
And they told me to put my dreams in the can
But I still made it here, damn!

[Hook: B.o.B]
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It’s just a different day with the same shit
It’s just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know

[Trey Songz:]

Get out my face like a hair that's ingrown
Lotta brains never took you for a bimbo
A lotta lames you was rolling with a pimp tho
And I let you ride like I ride instrumentals
So you was saying you gonna leave me
Well take your time be easy
Cause girl you could never play me
Even if you listening to a Trey Day CD
Before I eject your disc
Let me know you this
I'm a family guy truly
But I could give a fuck about the dog or Stewie

[Hook:]
I'm not saying this to make you upset

[Hook]

That you handle it
Can you handle it

Baby girl cause you must’ve got to comfortable

You can come on home now
Come on home
Come on home now on home

Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, "There go the candy man"
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
Thirty-two-inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat? Custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, "Ah, there go them superstars!"
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash

Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck
I'm horny as fuck, bitch, are you suckin' my dick or what?
I'll fuck a chick in the butt, I really don't give a shit
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch?
You fuckin' keyed up my Benz? Bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make-A-Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' brat, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me
Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run, take this gun and cover me, Slater and quit your—

[Hook]
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba-ba-controllably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably

[Outro]
"Tracy, I joined this class 'cause I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she's never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work"

"I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth"

"I know, but I'm over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan
I mean, look at him, it looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my entire life
And, I'm just saying, I wash and dry, I'm like a single mother
And no offense, but everyone takes this class to get an A and it's bullshit, but uh, no offense, I'm just saying
And I'm not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu?
Am I gonna be a chef? No
There's three weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing
Oh my god, that's like the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my life!
It's insane
Can you tell us again? Do you have time?
Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I'm in the car right now
Listen, I am McLovin, yeah
McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah!"

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
It's the pick of the litter
Mobbin' deep in the woods with six other niggers
Yelling at the trees, like, "Hey, hi, Mister!"
I'm Life-Litter's official stripe-getter
Dig this: I'll get a shovel and strike sisters
And kick 'em when the handle starts digging in my blisters
Sick, cynical cyanide spitter
So when I kick rhymes, my victims die quicker
I'm broke, no cheese, my hoes crackered
(Snort third verse, "Pigions") I'll show you a dope rapper
I'll shit on a nigga with no bladder
Then throw it in his eyes to show him he don't matter
The night creeper in a nice white Jeep-er
With three white divas who snort and like penis
I'm hotter than at least five heaters
In the middle of the summer with a sleeved wife-beater
Purebred degenerate, gentleman
Little Aryan n*gger with hairy clit for dinner
It's Wolf Gang, triple six, niggas on that simple shit
I'm on a fucking spree, burning bodies in a rental whip
Wolf Gang rad, no bum-ass shit
So since the fans lagging, now they tryna come back quick
Ask from 'Dera to Fax (They say, "Fuck that shit!")
We half-African swagging—of course we run that shit

[Verse 2: Mike G]
Yeah, I been sick since I was unmixed and mastered
Blastin' Bastard, screaming, "Fuck another rapper!"
O.F. soldier, Buffalo Bill
Don't think I will, but I'm a gunner for the Bills, like Tasker
Ha, I'm the cream of the crop
Officers in the trunk with six other cops
No way that I'll stop, they'll arrest me after
Fix the scene just to put me on screen like an actor
Shit, no need to tell me, I know it's hot—
As weather where them bitches wear bikinis with polka dots
It's overly overkill, because my niggas know a lot
'Bout taping and raping and throwing overboard from a yacht
So now, they probably hate me, but that's why the fuck I'm here
And you should man up, there's no need to be sincere, faggot
Heard that you were queer, so why would you fuck with wolves
That'll leave you on the ground like your rap career? Ha, ugh
So you don't want it—don't start none
We're fuckin' Radical, been Fucking Awesome
Talked a lot of shit so, for words, you're at a loss
Raised enough money just to get someone to kill my boss
Ha, now, that's a fucking "suit for hire"
Hang her higher, light a fire, fuck my former supervisor
I'm the truth, you a liar, blue as Clues, I inspire
Odd Future, motherfucker—I'm your new supplier
And since I'm presently on the incline
I feel inclined to invite y'all
In the mind I'm feelin' real spiffy
Signed sealed illest label deal in the city
Check me and my fifty dollar fifty-nine fifty
Buyin' diamonds is just no longer in me
So no more chains flooded watches on the right hand
I work like a Mexican spend like a White man
That's right man
I could Bentley afford
Instead I copped a couple skateboards
And some sneakers
My kick game is crazy
Keep a French eyeglass, a backstage pass and a model for a lady
Charlie stop whinin' I got a bottle you babies
Don't get gassed up on what you pomp-pomps think
Cause the heart still dark as Mont Blanc ink
But the real OG'S told me fall on back
You got a Secret Service now you call on that
If that ain't real, man, I fall on tacks
I'm feelin' real good
I think I might post in here
And hold the Westside down like it's a coast
This year
Bishop G, they told me I should come down cousin
But I flatly refuse
I ain't dumb down nothin'
Like BOW
Lovin' the Chi right now
Comm Sense the priest
Bump Jay the chief
Kanye the champ
Twista man the beast
Crucial still the king
Kato, rest in peace
And for those that ain't never met I
I own 1st and 15th
I'm Lupe the Jedi
Jay don't mind me I'm just blowin' my zone up
Doin' it bout as fly as a maggot grown up
And still got a life that's backing the poems up
Just give me a foldin' chair I ain't after the
Throne but
Got a broken lamp flow that nobody ain't touch
Just sayin if FnF ain't up
Friend naw
This ain't a pen, this a paint brush
And I intend to rearrange how they paint us
And

[Verse 1: D.C. Pierson]
Y'all know the name
No action, all flame
It's D to the C, no practice, all game
And not the game that your computer came installed with
So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with
The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins
Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us
It's all about us
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
Til then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude
Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster
I stopped talking I'm tired of paying em lip service
Switched over them street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish
And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are
Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star
APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts
Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt
When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this
A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this

I am just different
Motherfucker, I'm different
Yeah, I am just different
Yeah, I am just different

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on another
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes I'm a O.G
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say?
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the Coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Ahhhh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him gimme the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seein'
No, I'm not European bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand what I'm kickin'
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum here I come
With the gat, and the guitar will strum, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'ma catch you then I'll peel your cap
Snap back, relax
Ya bet' not be slippin' with them D's on that '83 Cadillac
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
G'z up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Yea the man and the myth
The whispers the gossip
Words from a chick
He oh so cute
And he down to earth too

You can call me Moon Man

And I'm just visitin'
No beyond the beats
To lyrics you are listenin'
Everything I am is probably everything they not so

You can call me Moon Man

I have no plan
I just landed here to approach those lames
With the weakest of ears
Stop livin' in fear
Even though shits eerie
No matter the cost
Motha fuckas will hear me
And I will out shine and out rhyme Those lames you don't cut it
Midwest cleveland niggas
Please M-Dub it?
You can call me Moon Man

To the haters who still puzzle
It's okay I'm a dog who still muzzle
But once I'm unleashed like Jet Li
I'm kickin' it

You can call me Moon Man

Like a tribe of questin
Supplyin like a radio hot line request on the radio
Somewhat mentally challenged like Radio
Can't fade me
Like a bad barber
It's new sound it's E pill
Take it at your own risk word to Emile
I don't know B that's the words of Patrick

You can call me Moon Man

Shit it so damn sick
No antibiotic can ever fuckin stop it
If you copped it
Please OD

You can call me Moon Man
If not for me please do it for music
I make immortal songs for the mortals to cruise with
For mortals to live with
Expand they realm
For my people free
Find peace in these
You won't be free
'Till you live on the stars
Shootin' by the moon
I'll be seeing you soon
But for now I'm away steppin'
Put me up in your away message
Word for word I keep rollin' on 'em
Rollin' on 'em
Wha wha wha wha
I keep rollin on 'em rollin' on 'em
I'm rollin' on 'em
Next

[Intro]
Yeah, Ho!
It's Drake, uh, uh, Ho!
Do that dance, do that dance

[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1]
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby (Yeah)
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at (Oh)
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at (Oh)
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back (Uh)

[Bridge]
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Easy baby (It what it is)
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Easy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Outro]
Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah, trendsetters
Drake, it's southern smoke

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But

[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigga"
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 1: KiD CuDi]
Yeah yeah yeah..... cudi!..... fools gold
Awesome the words im too smart young black man
Not on any curbs
But I like them with the curves
Maybe from the hood or maybe from the burbs
Before I was embedded in the fog
Now people address me in theyre blogs
And I love it dog yeah yeah I rock this shit for y'all.... heyyyy
So when you see me salute this is for all the haters that ain't really give a hoot
If im not dope I'm the worst patoot and no homeboy I dont aim for the loot
But I aim for change within the CRAP game I mean the RAP game with soo many names
Some official some are like poo poo who a issue with you what the fuck?
Do you understand your position pimpin? all we hear about is sex and pinchin
Pass the next and we need to switch it early 90's hell yeah I miss it
Naughty By Nature 2Pac and BIG shit I am the piece of the puzzle thats probably missing
And I guess im here for that job, so all the swagger jackers need to step off

[Hook]
I know you hear it over and over
Sucka em-cee's should move over, over
Im runnin these niggas over, over
Im runnin these haters over, over
Ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ima change the game
Ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ima do my thing with the game
Ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ima change the game
Ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Lets go
You see ima go as far as I can go
I smoke to get high because the world is so low
Within me is soul, I let myself flow
See these niggas is lame man its a shame
But see a hero will reign you'll all know his name
The man on the moon
The man on the moon, moon, moon

[Intro: Audio Two (Eminem)]
I get money, I, I get money, I
I get, I get, I get, I get (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Audio Two (Eminem)]
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah!)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah!)
I, I get money, money I got (I get it!)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run this rap shit!)
I, I get money, money I got (Now, guess who's back?)
I, I get money, money I got (You thought I left you!)
I, I get money, money I got (Now, why would I do that?)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (1, 2, 3! Ha!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's 'cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long?
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn, I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun 'cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned?
How does it feel to know I came in this game at twenty-five
And could'a retired at twenty-nine in my twenties still?
And Fif' hit a lick on that Coca-Cola shit
He ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score!
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office, man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
'Til I hear the word "has-been", that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

[Hook: Audio Two (50 Cent)]
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah, yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a Teflon Don, boy, I run New York
When I come outta court, yeah, I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid

[Outro]
Woah, hey (I-I get it)
Woah, hey (I-I get it)
Woah, hey (Yeah)
Woah, hey (I run New York)
Woah, hey (I-I get it)
Woah, hey (I-I get it)
Woah, hey (Yeah, yeah)
Woah, hey (I run New York), woah
I get money, money I got
(I'm back on the streets, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm bringing the heat, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm on my grind)
Money I got, money I got
(Like all the time)
I get money, money I got
(Trying to stop my shine)
I get money, money I got
(I'll cock my 9, don't get outta line)
Money I got, money I got
(I said don't get outta line
I-I get it, I-I get it
Yeah, yeah)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Is this thing on? Word

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
Uhh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uhh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun
So we just roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
And what we have here
Snoddy great, Trey

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Girl, I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head
Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh uh, everythin' hooks
Everythin' works, you're a real good chorus
I'm a real good verse, freestyle unrehearsed
So clean, no curse
And when the song's gone, man everythin' hurts
So I put it in reverse, go back to the scene where I seen you first
Yeah, I need you to sing that single again
Play that video I seen you up in
A hundred million spins in my mind all day
Callin' requests on the line always
Yeah, the president of your fan club
Leave them players all behind like a band love

[Hook: Trey Songz & Lupe Fiasco]
Girl, I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head
(I can't get you out now) Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Playa need a minute
Like a time out in tennis 'fore I finish
How'd I get in this, maybe 'was your hair, maybe 'was your flair
Maybe it's the heels and the way you wear
Maybe it's you're real and the way you care
You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire
The only thing that matters that the feeling's there
Your smile's so bright it's like a grill's in there
High off life, don't need a pill in there, nah
You're killin' me, I think I need a will in here
Got me feelin' real skills impaired
Hard to describe why you're still in here

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Girl, I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head
Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Lupe Fiasco]
Don't care what nobody say 'cause I like it girl
Might go crazy tryna figure this out, love
But I like it girl
Don't even know why I feel this way 'cause I like it girl
Caught up in something that I can't get out of
But we like it girl
C'mon

[Hook: Trey Songz & Lupe Fiasco]
Girl, I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head
I can't get you out now, said, I can't get you out now
(I want you to know) Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it
Girl, I want you to know, I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head
Lupe, Trey, yeah (I want you to know)
Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it
Just making sure, I don't even know

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Trey Songz]
Lupe, Trey
I can't get you out of my head, my head

[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Verse 1]
Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause I pack shows, sell ticks like Boston
Pat your back, ho, why the fuck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my straitjacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?
Just 'cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex
M-Mark it with an X, they talkin' them checks now, now, now

[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Verse 2]
Why did you envy? Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why, when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see, all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sundown
'Cause now when I come through, I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos, did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump, if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up, in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go "Ding!"

[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Bridge]
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me-e-e-e-e?
'Cause you thought that I would die, but I'm fine
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh (Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh)
I'm on a go, I'm on a go, yeah
But, bad gyal, try to stop my flow, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus]
Envy, all they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that
Envy, why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm coming back, swinging for that ass?

[Post-Chorus]
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Sw-swinging for, sw-sw-sw-swinging for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?

[Kanye West]
It’s like I wanna spit something written
But keep forgetting
So I guess it’s from the heart from the start
Played my part
Seemed like I just wasn’t reaching the charts
5000 hours, rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober, some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyoncé up to give the award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya

[Mos Def]
No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas, I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on

[Verse 1]
Turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtains
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)
I got this message for you girl
But it seems I was never on time
Still I gotta get through to you girl
On time, on time (word)
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good loving
(Uh, uh, right, uh)
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah I want to give you some good, good loving (uh)

[Verse 2]
Turn your lights down low
Never ever try to resist, oh no
Let my love come tumbling in
Into our lives again
And ooh, I love you

And I want you to know right now
(Know right now)
Ooh I love you
(Uh-uh, yeah, uh)
And I want you to know right now (uh)
Because I, that I
I want to give you some love (uh, yeah)
I want to give you some good, good loving
Oh I

[Outro]
I want to give you some good, good loving
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good loving
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Bob Marley] & 

[Lauryn Hill]
Turn your lights down low
And'a pull your window curtain
Oh let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time 

[Long, long time]
I kept this message for you, girl
But it seem I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, girl
On time
On time

[Chorus]
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I want to give you some good, good lovin'

[Lauryn Hill] & (Bob Marley)
Turn your lights down low
Never ever try to resist, oh no
Oh let your love come shinin' in
Into our lives again
Saying: ooh, I love you, (I love you)
And I want you to know right now
Ooh I love you
And I want you to know right now
That I, that I
I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
Pre - Hook : Lauryn Hill
Loving you is a like a song I replay
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day
And every chorus was written for us to recite
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might, this ocean might carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses a happiness more clearly than ever heard
And when I play ‘em, every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him
The harmonies possess, a sensation similar to your caress
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes
Stand in love, take my hand and love Jah bless
Right, right

[Bob]
I want to give you some good, good loving
Turn your lights down low
And-a pull your window curtains

[Lauryn]
And let Jah love come tumbling in
Into our lives again

[Bob]
Sayin’, it’s been a long, long time

[Lauryn]
I got this message for you, boy

[Bob]
But it seems I was never on time

[Lauryn]
Still I wanna get through to you, boy

[Bob and Lauryn]
On time
On time
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’

[Lauryn]
Good, some good, good, good, good, good, good

[Bob]
I want to give you some good, good lovin'

[Lauryn]
Good, good
Oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Yeah
Please don’t forget passionate
Babies in the bassinet
You call, we be ready
Ha ha, Ma steady
Yeah, yes
Baby love

[Hook: Eric Turner]
I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Freedom, we can use some of that especially where we from
Where we grew up like a green thumb
It's like a criminal is the only thing you can become
Look at what I became
Something like a phenom, Nuthin' but a G Thang
Things I've seen when I'm looking out of these frames
Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell a son
Who ain't have a father
How to try to grow up and be one
See, um, feel it in my bones
That I'm sitting on a throne
Like a killer with a chrome
When I spit another poem
Shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home, pow!

[Hook: Eric Turner]
I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

[Verse 2: Sway]
Super Swah, the cape remains, thought I was M.I.A no paper?
Planes, I'm fly plus I don't write no more, its all off of the top I shaved the braids
And stayed sharp mother knew how to raise-a-blade (Razor Blade)
I paid my dues now I wait for change and the flows so rude it goes without...
Ask Lupe I'm Sucre, I aid the break
Quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai, I like to travel light
I've gotta leave you at home Delilah
This is Samson-ite
No case for the police
Said I know Killah's, I never seen them
Ghostface, only time I'm watching is my Panerai
I've got an alibi
I was taking pics in Chicago, call me Camera Chi

[Hook: Eric Turner]
I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Chain broke, nicorette for your chain smoke
No cigarrettes on my plane, yo
Snatching herringbones from the game throat
Put it on mine, take a long time
B.A. Baracus is how I'm looking online
In the webisode, necklace stole, let 'em know
That I put up the footage that I'm takin' your shine
Wanna see the real chains? Look in your mind
Your brain look like Keenan Wayans, brother
Overgold, overload, broken soul
Niggas playing games in the hood they got you stuck-up
Playa thinkin' that its cool to be a pimp still
We gon' set it free like a fish in a pimp heel
Take this home, rearrange it, change it
Danger, Sway-zer, Lupe Laser. Pow!

[Hook: Eric Turner]
I waited all my life to play
I still can't find a way
But if I work it one more day
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain
I might just break the chain

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Ha, ha
If you feeling good, give me a shoutout, alright?
Eh, What up? Alright
Poo Bear!
I'm really saying this to myself, alright (alright)
Claudio, alright
So how we gon do this one?
Uh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
This one goes out to the baby girls
In a rush growing up in this crazy world
Yeah your brother on the road and he never home
I know you feeling kinda sad now that daddy gone
You can't let it get you down, gotta carry on
We only lose things because it make us strong
You always had my love, and now you got a song
From the biggest biggest fan that you've ever known
I know you won't be little girls, not for very long
And you ain't gotta have a man if you don't ever want
Cause I'm gonna make sure you got two of everything
That you ever want, every tone, like your very own
Not to make you hard to respect
Just really really really really hard to impress
It's a whole wide world for you to go and get your hands on
Until then, just come and get your dance on now

[Hook: Poo Bear]
I see you coming up
I'ma give you the low-down, down, down
You ain’t never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, this for everybody feeling good
You know who you are, or you misunderstood
Never had money, or you living good
If you from the burbs, if you in the hood
Recognize where we come from
In my day, mane, I did a little somethin' some
They like "how come you don't rap that?"
Cause that's a back track and I ain't tryna back that
I'm only moving forward, homie, that's that
Direction, a lot of shawties lack that
I'm just tryna' give it to 'em like sat nav
Now I know I might not make out like a fat rat
That's cool as long as they don't trap crack
Graduate from school, and still let his pants sag
Never catch a case, know how to let his cash stack
Welcome to the map, go anywhere you tap at now, yeah

[Hook: Poo Bear and Lupe Fiasco]
I see you coming up (uh)
I'm a give you the low-down, down, down (alright, alright, alright)
You ain’t never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round

[Bridge: Poo Bear]
When the floor falls out
I'mma be there to carry you
And if you want that star
I'll go get it out the sky for you
If you cry, shed a tear
I'mma dry your eyes
Just to let you know it'll be alright

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, I know it's like a whole lot going on
Things going right, things going wrong
Maybe baby, on the way, and you feel so alone
Know that in this world you're never really on your own
God got a number get him on the phone
He'll never put you places where you don't belong
Put you through the pain, to put you on the throne
And I know that from the bottom of my corazon
And if they looking at you sideways
You just wave right back, tell 'em hi hater
Mad you ain't hanging with 'em in the driveway
Nah we gon' keep it moving to the highway
Strong is puttin' on, the weak is all over like Friday, chilling
Shout out to King David for bringing in Philly
And all my pretty independent women in the building, let's go!

[Intro]
(Hot shit) (Aww shit)

[Verse 1: Count Bass D]
I strive to be humble, lest I stumble
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust
Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up
Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders
(Hot shit)

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
What, these old things? About to throw 'em away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ
Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay
MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?
Working on a way that we can roll away tinted
Some say the price of holding heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die
They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry
You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat
I coulda had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side, it won't get blistered
Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding (Hot shit)

[Verse 3: Count Bass D]
When I was four, I penned "God Was Born In New York"
Back in '77, still got nan in the crescent
The effervescence of God's presence is thick
Unlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker
Peace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers
Looked her up and down; said, "Hmm, too much makeup"
Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up, heads do (Aww, shit)
My name is Dwight Spitz, I'm a Sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a nagging habit
Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it into fine wine
"Barely born a virgin" is what the stars said
Black not white, red all over, though, like Elmo
Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love
I get mad love, but I detest the labor
And its wages—you know, death?
I'm servin' life from this gift of God
Don't forget your potholders, my niggas

[Outro]
(More hot shit)
(More hot shit)
(More hot shit)
A short time later

[Intro]
Burn one, burn one

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a gold mouth dawg, definition of the South
Ain't no quarters, ain't no halves, just some wholes in 'dis house
Ain't no bitch, it ain't no bed, it ain't no clothes in dis house
It's a drought, and my price will make yo eyes pop out
I can't neva count my stash 'cause I always loose count
I can't neva keep no bitch 'cause I put them hoes out
I was corner store and in the motel in it, selling it
You can check my rap sheet, its numerous felonies
I took twenty-three stacks, and bought some jet skis
Have pity for the cop who gotta arrest me
A front street, jump street, then jump out, itss a track meet
Use to have a ten-speed, now I got a Bentley

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got my rims finger-fucked by a god dam J
Gave him 1.8 of some hard ass yay
It's a lot of crack smokers in the apartments where I stay
And I know they name and face 'cause I serve them everyday
Had a 98' Caprice, was a rollin' drug store
You ain't got all the money, what you call my phone fo'?
Rob me, six feet, in the dirt you 'bout to go
Layin' with the coroner with a tag placed on your toe
I can lock the whole town if I break the shit down
But it might be slow, so I'm sellin' shit whole
I can lock the whole town if I break the shit down
But I'm lettin' shit go and I'm sellin' shit whole

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Niggas call me "thrift store" 'cause the know the price low
I count 18 rubber bands every time I swing my door
Breaker, breaker, beaker, beaker
Spent 350 on the sneakers
It came from servin' geekers
Yella' 'Vette nicknamed Chiquta
A clear coat Chevy, same color Aquafina
Quarter million dollar lick, that changed my whole demeanor
Ridin' a scooter through South Beach, lookin' for a Trina bitch
Diamond necklace, diamond anklet, diamond princess, Bimmer bitch
I change lanes, paint change, hangin' out the brain dawg
Bottles of champagne and it came from sellin 'caine dawg
Coca-cola, pickin' yola, and it stank, you smell the odor
When I sk-sk-sk-sk-skrrt, I bet it jump back over, over
Ridin' in my rental, got a Rover in my pocket, though
84 stack, 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Nigga violate, I'ma kill him and slit his throat
Smoke a blunt of dro, then take my ho to Pappadeaux's

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Swing my door, swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
And you know they swing my door
And it's 18-5 every time they swing my door
Swing my door, swing my door
Yeah, them prices real low
But they gon' search you up and down
Every time they swing my door, nigga

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
That boy Gucci
That nigga Burn on the track, nigga
Yeah, Gucci Mane, La Flare, nigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm a street nigga, dog, everybody knows that
So a hater get smashed, bond money on deck
Gave my dog half a brick for a '73 donk
Got that bullfrog yay, cause I know it's gon' jump
I'm a real street nigga, do you understand me?
I'm a walking bankroll, breezy, rubber-band me
Red Monkeys on my ass, Gucci frames on my face
Got that "Tony Tiger Kush," man, pimpin' smoke great
Every time my phone ring, dog, it's eighteen-five
Only problem that I have is what car I'm gon' drive
Im a real street nigga, I ain't never had shit
Man, this chain 'round my neck cost four or five bricks
I'm a street nigga, dog, I don't love no bitch
I ain't talkin' to you, baby, 'less you buyin' ten bricks
Bought an '06 Lamb' with the butterfly doors
That's a quarter-million dollars gone, just to pull hoes

(Chorus)
I'm a street nigga, dog
I'm a street nigga, dog
You a street nigga, just like me
I'm a street nigga, dog
I'm a street nigga, dog
No industry, I'm in these streets
Im a street nigga, dog, hoes love my swag
And the Jacob on my wrist, that's a drop-top Jag
Bought a drop-top Vette, and a super-bad bitch
"How much you think you worth?"
'Bout 95 bricks
Way back in '94, it was 95 cents
Now I'm 95 south, with an R&B bitch
Every time I leave the house, bring at least ten grips
Cause it's two or three stacks just to park my whips
Got a small amount of niggas, but a large amount of clips
And a blue Bent' Coupe same color as the Crips
Mean mug on my face, nigga, ain't nothin funny
60 grand on the Jacob, nigga, time costs money
Got a quarter million plate, that's eighteen blocks
When the cops try to whip me, man, I ain't gon' stop
Im a real street nigga, dog, I ain't gon' lie
Bought a pound of Bubba Kush, just to get the clique high

(Chorus)

I'm a street nigga, dog, so I love my whip
Car-jack a street nigga, that's how niggas get killed
Im a street nigga, dog, so I love my block
Paid a junkie three grams just to wash my drop
Street niggas love me, and I love street niggas
Got an out of town trap, come twice a week, nigga
Im an East Atlanta vet, man, I ain't done yet
Bitches standin' in line just to wipe my sweat
If you make a good count,then you under good check
Never beef with street niggas, dog, that's ya best bet
Street niggas make a college bitch's panties so wet
To a project bitch, I'm the best it's gon' get
Street nigga of the year, dog, yeah, that's me
Just to see my wrist twirl, man, it's eighteen G's
Gucci eatin' real good, dog, what about you?
Im a street nigga, dog, you a street nigga too?
(Chorus)

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ugh, sometimes, living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend 'til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard, and it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying?
Can't figure out what I'm implying?
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side
And you can't come find him
How, when it's light all around you?
Yeah, but it's dark all inside him
No winners when it's me against me
One of us just ain't gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Your's been the one keepin' me alive

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
This world is such a fucked up place
My mind's such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe what's up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well, all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things, yeah, you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading
Love! I can't win if it's me against me
One of us ain't gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive
Yours been the one keepin' me alive

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
There's only two ways out
Of here
You're way too late, you'll be trapped here
Forever
There's only two ways out
Of here
One's through the door
The other's through me

[Intro: Matt Mahaffey]
You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win when we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The future's cloudy and it's raining on the poor class
Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is balling on a budget
The military's says it's gon' need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas, keep us in our hoods
And hope we never explore past, stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learn in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash
And a Sealy has the same feeling as the floor has
And that's where you should stay; this is what they play

[Hook: Matt Mahaffey]
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
You're now tuned into the weakest
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that, you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Hi you're on the air, now what you want to hear
Well we ain't got the truth but how about a remix
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart, you will be a superstar
And if you dumb it some, maybe you could be number one

[Hook: Matt Mahaffey]
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So beware what's on the airwaves
And be more aware of what's not gettin' airplay
Independent spirit, you can barely hear what they're sayin'
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everywhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back-to-back on relay
We're really where it lives, make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJs

[Bridge: Matt Mahaffey]
You must be a radio station
And who are we, we must be
A number one song, spinnin' all day long
And you put me on daily rotation
You're on the air, we know you're scared
But we don't care, we'll play this here

[Hook: Matt Mahaffey]
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we don't win
When we call in and nothing's free
Sounds to me like
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio
State run radio, state run radio

[Intro]
And I’m willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MC's
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: "I'm a G.O.A.T.!"
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 1]
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage
Inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know that I got a lot up
In my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters
Killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them
Than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MC's?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best
And that he's the only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me
One of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Verse 2]
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem or a new Shady
If they think it's gonna happen, man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong
And they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up Paul Wall's white
‘Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right?
And it's so sad ‘cause he's dope, right?
America's next great white hope, right?
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right?
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white
And the best golfer's black?"
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide
So I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka, because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? — "No."
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit

[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look
If they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the Greatest Of All Time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes

[Outro]
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home
Man, shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball
‘Cause I'm a G.O.A.T
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
‘Cause I know that you know that I know
That you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T
I'm out y'all, it's been real—peace!

[Instrumental and Percussion Intro]

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights, speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep, lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm begging me don't let me go, we vow like the letter "O"
To never go our separate ways and spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin', playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits, livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow, can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers, shootin' out of you and me

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Sometimes I feel like the world—
Sometimes I feel like the world
Is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This Uzi weighs a ton
But I think I'm done

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh

[Outro: Sarah Green]
Think I'll be letting you go
Things are getting outta control
Said, it feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
I think I'll be letting you go
Letting you go

[Refrain]
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get you
Sometimes, I don't understand
Sometimes, I love you
Sometimes, it's you I can't stand
Sometimes, I wanna hug you
Sometimes, I wanna push you away
Most times, I wanna kiss you
Other times, punch you in the face
'Cause every minute, you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me, and baby, I'm back with you, oh

[Refrain]
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I catch you
Sometimes, you get away
Sometimes, I read you
Other times, I'm like, "Where are you on the page?"
Sometimes, I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated, my heart knows better

[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

[Bridge]
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone

[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

[Refrain]
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no

Gang-sta, gang gang-sta

Gang-sta, gang gang-sta

[Hook]
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
I don’t care what you haters saying, I’m getting paid
And if you not talking money then I don’t understand your language

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
It's going down, down Barbie, pushing a pink Ferrari
I race through Africa just to see the safari
I am the baddest bitch in America
Slicker than a Jheri curl, just ask Erykah
The black Sarah Jessica, J-J-Jessica!
Don't be text messaging me, I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me is how I want my sandwiches
I want more cheese, lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on the stage I'm with SB
And when you see my luggage it says LV
And when I'm on the plane it's so empty
Hmmm, that's why all those female rappers envy

[Hook/Outro (Spoken)]
Oh, I'm sorry. Did she say something? My bad
You know, maybe I was booked. I guess I missed ya
You know, when you're booked four times a week every week, it's kinda hard to keep track of bum bitches
Oh, you do the math
It's barbie, bitch!

Look at me Lee

Come look at me Lee, I'm a star

[Verse 1]
I come from Cleveland
Y'all can really hear it now
Hit 'em like comic books
Kaboom! Pow-Pow
Into a girl's mind
Spit fine; no wine, dine
I keep two phones, sidekick for bad dimes
And a topical question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, "He ain't even made a mill"
They say I'm complex just like the magazine
I wear my closet complex like the magazine
I get in their head
They don't even see my bread
Oh so, oh so fly
Cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy
I keep 'em short and sweet, thick and petite
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme
I'm from a place where old-schools are common (Yep-yep)
Gotta explain every time I'm rhymin', (I be) I be

[Chorus]
I be all day rollin' in my whip
Got my sippin' cup out on the low
(Uh-huh, hey)
I keep two pretty women by my side
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes
And I say
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is my, my city (Wow)

[Verse 2]
Yup-yuppers, smile all the time while
I chop it up like Michael Watt's slow talk style
So the girlies can really catch all my accent
And the double-O got our own accent
Some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam
Some niggas sell CDs up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'
I play the O'Jays, while I'm turnin' lanes
We be on our shit
Freakin' Black & Milds, still controllin' the whip
Ain't no city like Cleveland
Cruisin' with my bad bitch in the evenin'
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way?
Take a trip to the land, swing this way
After the song done, ain't much I can say
Cleveland is my city

[Chorus]
I be all day rollin' in my whip
Got my sippin' cup out on the low
(Uh-huh, hey)
I keep two pretty women by my side
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes
And I say
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, (Oh) Cleveland is the (Oh)
Cleveland is my, my city

And now I want it bad, want it bad, a lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me, just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it

The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a - huh! - and a game
And a game (Huh!)

And a game (Huh!)
A lovegame!

[Chorus]
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Don't think too much, just bust that kick)
Dans the lovegame (I wanna take a ride on your disco stick)

[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)]
Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Riding across the land, kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name was MCA, I said, "Howdy," he said, "Hi"

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock, MCA]
He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
He said, "Can I get some?" – I said, "You can't get none!"
Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
"Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (yeah)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (yeah)
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (uh huh)
I run this land, you understand? I've made myself clear?"
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin

[Verse 3: Ad-Rock, MCA, (Mike D)]
Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision, as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, "I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter."
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
The beat was a-bumping, and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, "Yippie Yo, you know this kid?"
I said I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said, ("Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D, and I'm about to get money"
Pulled out the jammy,  I aimed it at the sky)
He yelled ("Stick 'em up!") and let two fly
Hands went up, and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
("I'm Mike D, and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect")
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player, and I punched him in the face
Piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef, and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money (MCA snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold

[Verse 1]
I'm a faggot, I'm a retard
I got a girl's bag and a v-card
I got three friends and a whack-ass ride
You can judge by the cover cause it's shitty on the inside
No girls want to fuck me, trust me
I don't give a fuck, don't adjust me
Just, please, shut your face hole for just one second
"Fuck you, faggot. You're so fucking dumb!"
Dumb? I'm the dumb one?
Calm down, Bo. Just count to ten
Um, one, two, three, whore - I mean four, shit
Three, four five, bitch - I mean six, shit
I quit, I got no patience
You won, I face it
Your life peaks at graduation
Well, congradu-fucking-lations

[Chorus]
NERDS
The faggots, the spastic fat chicks who sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
NERDS
The kid with acne and tons of Proactiv packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid

[Verse 2]
And do you know why, kid, I can rap so mean?
I was reading while you were fucking the Prom Queen
Huddle up reading, no lacrosse team
"Huddle up, huddle up!"
What? You lost me
Sorry, bro, did I interrupt the circle of jerks all circle-jerking?
I need saving? Fuck no
Quoth the Raven? No, fuck Poe
Ah, shit I'm bitchin', listen
They don't know what they're missing
For instance, I like poetry, I like instruments
Maybe we have similar interests
But it's no fall-balls, no balls fall
Just sit and scrawl on the stall wall
At 3 P.M. I pause
That shit sounds like applause

[Chorus]
NERDS
The faggots, the spastic fat chicks who sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
NERDS
The kid with acne and tons of Proactiv packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid
I got your back, kid

[Bridge]
She stood in line and got cut
Tried out, got cut
Loved art, but the budget got cut
Then she got numb and she only felt when she knelt and cut
NERDS
NERDS, NERDS
NERDS, NERDS

[Chorus]
NERDS
The faggots, the spastic fat chicks who sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
NERDS
The kid with acne and tons of Proactiv packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid
I know it's bad, kid
I got your back, kid
Nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that don shit
Dom Pérignon shit
Not gon' cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling
Bout as sweet as a jumper on a gay Ray Allen
I’m bout fucking hoes like Ray J wilding
Killing niggas like KKK violence
I guess it why they pay homage
Momma I’ma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
We Love You Lupe
(I Love You, Baby, I Love You)
We Love You Lupe
We love You
(I Love You Too)

Uh, thats what they say to me
And I entertain it quite playfully
But serious though, I'm curious george
Killing cats with a flow type gracefully
Lean back and I raise my feet
Give a little blow before I sip my tea
On a world tour I'm making Paris
Lu at the Louvre can't wait to see
8.50 I done paid my fee
Say What Up To Venus And I Take My Lead
Hit Collette, and then Bape, Esprit
Decide to sit it down like a maître d
Watch All The Pretty Little Mates To Be
They Be Trying To Picture How I Make My Cheese
Little Apricot On The Plate I Eat
Running late on my Casio face I see
Chefs in the kitchen wanna bake my steez
But I keep it chill bout the 8th Degree
Everywhere I go I gotta take my skis so
Cool Turn Milk In A Taste It Free
Used to watch trolley go to Make-Believe
Eurostar, First Class, take my seat
Few More Pounds In My Hmp
Now I Got The Bounce - I Can Make Them Sing

[X2:]
We Love You
We Love You
We Love You
Yes We Do, We Love You

She Said She Loves Me And I Believe Her
Making It 100 Times Harder For Me To Leave Her
Im So Eager To Prevail
If Music Was A Female, I'd shag Her
And End Up Coming Quicker Than An Email
Why? Do It And I Leave Her
I'm Going Over Seas So Hide Your Daughters Behind Your Doors
The Minosaurs And Tore Them Down Like Minotaurs
With Metaphors From ??? And Tauruses With Dinosaurs
(Sway) But I Don't Vrooom With A Tech
But I Will, If You Go Against My Code Of Respect
If I Don't Hustle, My Heart Will Stop
Back In Britain Rappers Post Up Half The Stock
They Ain't Moving Half The Stuff
And They Can't Fit In My Shoes So Put A Sock In It
You Better Stock It Before I Sock It To You
You're A Laughing Stock
Americans Pass My Bags I'm About To Blow So Fast When I Start It Already Passed The Orchestra
She Loves Me And I Still Believe Her
Making It 200 Times Harder For Me To Handle It
Im Coming To America
But I Ain't Playing Football With You Folks
Cuz The Last Time The Bloke Picked Up The Ball And Ran With It
Pass Me My Passport And My Cargo
She Still Yelling And Telling Me I Can't Go
Lupe, Running My My Plane
Im About To Leave On My Way, Chi-Car Go

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit, I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over

[Outro: Eminem & Yelawolf]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Game over!

[Intro]
Uh-huh
Friend of the People
Yeah, I mean c'mon
What the fuck do I gotta do
This one for the fans here, jack

[Refrain]
I think I'm Malco;m X, Martin Luther
Add a King, add a Junior
Some Bible verses, couple Sunnahs
An AK-47, that's a revolution, nigga
Think I'm 2Pac, Bob Marley
Fela Kuti, Marcus Garvey
Them the real ones, light a lighter for 'em
Let you know, that I'm ridin' for 'em

[Verse 1]
Go'n' gimme some, a lil' more beat
Call your friends around, then call the police
I'm ridin' with my flow, it take up four seats
So I'm gon' ghost-ride, but with no sheets
One man by myself, even then I'm four deep
Like hotel swimming pools, that's four feet
These niggas like the rooms, so suite
Priceline, so cheap
I'm the cell phone, they the room keys
I'm some shelltoes, they some shoestrings
I turn 'em off, I take 'em out
I'm Reverend Run, with the laces out
Adidas, so adios
All day, I dream, like I'm comatose
That's your ship sinking, and I'm so afloat
I'm T-Pain, I'm on a boat
Not the slave one, DiCaprio's either
Hear the waves come, they started in the bleachers
So I'm swag surfing, the pool's getting deeper
You still sweet, though, here come them roomkeepers
OK, I'll be the strings, you be the shoes
But guess what? Now they Jimmy Choos
I wear the pants, you Winnie Poohs
Your shit meows, my shit "Awoo!"
I got a fifth flow, call me brother-man
Africa the set, yea that's the motherland
For that BP, I shed fifty tears
In Nigeria, that oil been spilling for like fifty years
"Fifty years? Hell naw"
Hell yeah, I'm tryna tell y'all
At this rate, niggas gon' lose
Can't search for water or grow your own food
Tell me what's gon' happen when them stores close
And ain't gon open up no more
Yeah, that's the realest shit
You gon' feel that, hunger's your enemy
But you can't kill that
Nigga, wake up, don't join the army
Kill your own peoples, but fear Illuminatis
And they ain't even real, or are they?
But you ain't even know, because you par-tay—
Too fucking much, if you start to doubt
They already in your mind, and coming out yo mouth
It's not a trick, nigga, it's a trap
Survival of the fit is what they aiming at
And niggas ain't fit, fat as hell
Fat in mind; body fat, as well
Who use most the drugs? Americans
What's in Afghanistan? Heroin
You think that's by mistake? They can't stop that
Don't think you safe, though, because you not Black
Greed is colorblind, so I'm colorblind
They gon' fuck with yours soon as they done with mine
They say I try too hard, verses overwhelm
I learned most of this from niggas sitting in jail
Where you think I'm from? I'm from the streets, nigga
Triple OGs told me to teach, nigga
And that ain't made up, nope, that's a fact
They say that gangsta shit is the shit I rap
Look who I attract, look at my inner circle
Bunch of street niggas and a couple Urkels
Look at my fanbase, oh, yes
Fuck what Pro say, look at this protest
Where they do that at? Who they do that for?
Must mean I'm doin' bad, and things is movin' slow
We talkin' revolution on public radio
Then catch me down in Houston, sitting on them 84s
Trae, what's up? ABN
Got your back, nigga, sink or swim
Free Chilly Chill, shake off your masters
Pray to God, build your mind faster

[Hook]
I think I'm Malcolm X, Martin Luther
Add a King, add a Junior
Couple Bible verses, and some Sunnahs
An AK-47, that's a revolution (Nigga)
Think I'm 2Pac, Bob Marley
Fela Kuti, Marcus Garvey
Them the real ones, light a lighter for 'em
If you ain't know, I'm riding for 'em

[Intro: Drake]
Uh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a

[Chorus: Sean G. & Drake]
Video girl
Eh, yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it, I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill

[Chorus: Sean G. & Drake]
Video girl
Eh, yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Outro: Drake]
And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
And she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girl

[Intro]
And it'll be a long time, before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 1]
They want me, hold my head in shame
So I hold 'em on, holding hands in vain
Covers talkin' now the feds say I'm insane
A psych said "I'm going fumble 

[down on the platter ?]"
And then his son told me "Put down the drink dawg"
I got the rinks off, coming for the things off
I guess there's nothin' and I'm finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
Stomping on someone, with my boots
And I'll put it off, if we modest
And every other god need a goddess
And every other star, couldn't guide us
It falls upon something that's inside us
So I'm not gonna stop for my riders
Tell me where my ride is
Tell me where my ride is, uh

[Hook]
And I don't like them, and they don't like that
They don't like that, and I don't want that
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry about me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hatin' motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again

[Verse 2]
See, I need some time to meditate
Naw, bitch I'm fly, I need time to levitate
And I don't sound try, tryna' hesitate
Fumbled down, very late nigga, you a featherweight
And I'm a heavyweight, and I'm very great
I put the everyday rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
I must've on faith, getting knocked of faith
Guess it's my fate, guess it was written
I can sell a phone, guess I was different
That was somethin' back then, that was different
Now I'm spitting and everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound alike
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic?
I don't even sound right, feelin' like I'm on the downright
And these niggas are secondary, like Pippen around Mike
Trippin' around sight, something on that down light
I'mma be downright, you niggas is downright biters
And I'ma set fires
And my shit downright fire, from the corner buyer
And I'm alone, eh

[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
Don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout you and maybe I do
Have a long day
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you
I worry 'bout something not we can do
And it's on me
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, na-na-na-na
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
Before you ever see me again, me again, again, again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

[Bridge]
Can you clap your hands, hands?
Clap your, clap your hand, hands?
Clap your, clap your hand, hands?
And I wanna do something, I wanna do something then
Can you clap your hand, hand?
Need you to clap your hand, hands
Need you to clap your hand, hands
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand
Need you to clap your hand, hand
Need you to clap your hand

[Verse 3]
So the song like a Section 8
So I pass that dick around like a collection plate
I can sell 'em on Sunday, with the fuss you made
I be stunting with the stunnas, and that's the best you make
So if everybody just stand now, and shit don't plan out
Throw your hands up, at least give them a handout
And with the sun shown, it's like the Jerome is
Mommas on the cellphone days, I'm homeless
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Wait, just need two more shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
And it's something but the problem is, you still not it
Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm "That nigga"
Or maybe if I'm humble, it's not a cellphone finger
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit is thinner
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should know somethin' different, I could reconsider
Got something nothing seri' till the cellphone liver
And I'mma drink until I can't stand and got no more liver
I can stand and deliver 'til they pump my liver
And I'mma spit it, like it get it, kinda self, but I'm fine
I'd rather live by what I live by, then die when I'm fine
I'm gonna stand by my self 'til my very last breath
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And I'm proud 

[?]
And I could style on 

[?], hell with this
You can't style on me, nigga I'm out of your league
I'm liable to be a liability'
You plan to style on me, trying to style on me
Nigga, I'm liable to be a liability, and my ability
I can sound like 

[?]

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Hook 2]
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you
Worry about something, something will do
And motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again
So don't worry about me, I'll be fine
I'll be up some, going for mine
And it'll be a long time
'fore you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, worry 'bout you, worry 'bout you
'fore you ever see

[Verse 4]
Don't worry about what I been up to
Where the fuck I'm going? Nah, nigga fuck you
Who the fuck is going, I can something don't ask
Who the fucks asking? I'll put the summer on blast and
Who the fucks lasting?
And be the last standing
Caught up on the planning
Get a better tan and
I been feeling dandy
And who can run the planet? Pass them a Xanax
And an afternoon I annex
And all of the damage
Left on the platter
Who's soon after all, I guess it's a small world after all
Stunting on the sun, cause I have to ball
I run the world, cause it's a small world after all
And I'm never after y'all
I have to loss somethin' and I got it all
And you feeling like you got it all?
Humble some' 

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
Nah nigga, not at all

[Hook]
Worry 'bout me, don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And what'cha gon' do?
It'll be a long time, before you ever see me again

[Verse 5]
There's something on the all out, the call out, somethin' on the doormat
Last summer, last fight, and y'all had a fall out
I can sense nothing to something, what y'all 'bout?
Bumping nothing to something, and everything that y'all 'bout
Y'all had your ups and downs, I don't fuck around
Put everything on the something, then you go and fuck around
Bet you felt something, now you feel nothing now
Y'all feelings felt something, ya'll don't feel nothing now
Her tears dried up, from bumping expressionless
I was under exodus and learning what the lessons is
What the ebony of essences, the Genesis
I got the fetishes, something on the sedatives
One sip and then it'll have you look at innocence
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
Before the hook is in is there any point of any of this?
But understand 

[?]

[?] put hands on you, then put his front side, and put hands on you
Just turn around say for really? I'm done motherfucker
I can state something if

[Hook]
They worry bout me, just worry bout you, I can 

[?] when I be good
And she said that
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, just worry 'bout you
And I'll be up now, what I've been up to
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
We would always have the ability to start off right, right
By the end of the night we end up in a fight, whoa
Girl you said you’d never leave me, but you might
This time, this time, this time...
We was doing so damn good for so damn long
But as you can see something went terribly wrong, whoa
I been through this so I can stay strong
This time, this time, this time

[Hook]
Separated, separated
Separated, separated
Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow there will never be no more of
Separated, separated

[Verse 2]
We would always have the ability to pull it back together, gether, gether, gether
And you was always down for me, you ain’t give a fungress to whatever, ever
But now you’re here telling me that you deserve better
This time, this time, this time
Hey, and now im sitting here in the dark with nobody
And I don’t wanna be alone I need my shawty, shawty yeah
Cause luxury means nothing without the luxury of love

[Hook]

[Intro: Eminem]
Here's the story of a little boy
Growin' up in a suburban home
Trying to cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house that was built in the middle of the street

[Verse 1: Eminem]
"Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the jukebox"
"So what, he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him"
"You and that Tupack Shaker..."
"No! That ain't how you say his name, mom!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?"
"Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,"
"Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' Walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"Quit talking Black!"
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Tupack Shaker, I just asked him"
I'm freezin', (Achoo) I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
"I ain't did nothin' I didn't say 'I'm leavin'"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'"
"Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,"
"Fine, I'll le— Mom, you cut off the sleeves!"

[Hook: Fred Durst, Eminem]
Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house (One, two, three), in the middle of the street

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My teacher's two-faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to Fred's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is"
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her "Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay"
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay
(Let me stay)

[Hook: Fred Durst, Eminem]
Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house (Yo), in the middle of the street

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My brother's incoherent, Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
"Please, sell my step-son some cigarettes so I can smoke"
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and I'm stupid
I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ballpark
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom, you said you were broke."
"Who said? You got your ears messed up
From that damn rap music."

[Hook: Fred Durst]
Our house, in the middle of the street

Our house, in the middle of the street
Our house, in the middle of the street

[Intro]
Do I know your friend who? At a club?
Who was there? Girl I wasn't..
Wait a minute, calm down
I was at the club with who?
Get the fuck...man, you know what?

[Verse]
Girl I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame
Or call no names, real talk
See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk
Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sitting in VIP smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl
Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this
How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then
When the whole club packed?
Wait a minute, let me finish what I've got to say!
I've been with you five years and
You listening to your muh'fucking girlfriends
I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no-man-having ass hoes anyway
Real talk
Always accusing me of some old bullshit
When I'm just trying to have a good time
Robert you did this, Kells I heard you did that
Don't you think I got enough bullshit on my mind
Real talk, hold hold up
Didn't I just give you money to go get your
Hair, toes and nails done the other day, hmm
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Real talk, oh
Gave who some damn money?
I ain't gave nobody no damn money girl
Is you tweakin'?
You see what your problem is
You're always running off at the mouth
Telling your girls your motherfucking business, when
They don't eat with us, they don't sleep with us, besides
What they eat don't make us shit
Real talk
You call my momma's house and what?
Girl my momma ain't gotta screen no calls for me
Real talk, and watch your mouth
Fuck me? Girl fuck you!
I don't give a fuck about what you're talking about
I'm sick of this bullshit, I'm coming home and getting my shit
And getting the fuck up out of Dodge
You ain't gotta worry about me no more
And the next time your ass get horny
Go fuck one of your funky ass friends
Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway
You gon' burn what?
Bitch I wish you would burn my motherfucking clothes
With your trifling ass, Milton, you bogus girl, Milton
Start your car up and get ready to take me home
This bitch done lost her motherfucking mind

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Everyday is Cinemax, every night's a porno

The year's '49 and I know everything that Bo know
Two Thousand 1017 and I'm ballin

Bad to the bone, leave my hat where my home is
Scrapping told a G I leave my GAT where my tone's at
Brick Squad Mafia, dressed in black, your boy is back
And off the wall with bricks and bails and pints of lean and cars and all
Shining like a French cut diamond like an actor
Everyday is Cinemax, every night's a porno
Gucci Mane La Flare, I know everything that Bo know
Shining like a french cut diamond out of Frisco

Chicken finger-licking
Don't tolerate no snitching
Bricksquad trappin,chickens in the kitchen

Slide through the trap and my pockets on humongous

[Verse 1]
Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it, but I guess I can't, it
Shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man, what's the matter, have you no manners?
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'ma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute, man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you? Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'ma put it on my wee-wee, ooh, good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man, go ahead, what you waiting for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on, let's go, we're gonna make a porn
Ready, set, go hit play, record

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 2]
Are you ready? You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check, see
Have a little quick look, go on, sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did ya?
Now, what you gonna do when she gets ya?
I ain't going with ya, forget ya
Quit tryna hold my hand, mista
Pretend she's your little sista, little sista

[?] little dicta
Might as well take the whipped cream with ya
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch, uh, movie
A beastiality porno with smoothies

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Verse 3]
It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
Beauty and the Beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But 'stop' just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick till the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep goin', bitch, keep goin'

[Hook]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

[Outro]
Banana
Banana
Banana
Banana
Banana

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I all nighted, I every dayed it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't an asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang sworm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't cost me a 100 thou

[Hook]
Put my money, money where my mouth is

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.-
Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil
Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels dripping, big tooly
I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter
Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
Because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, 9-6 to "Reasonable Doubt"
Temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah you shining, but the only thing you're leaving out
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out

[Intro: Alex da Kid & Nicki Minaj]
Shhhh, Alex Da Kid is coming

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
So, so hot in here, feels like a jungle (Yeah!)
Me don't like boys that ain't jumbo (Yeah!)
One time, bust a shot for my champion girls
Tell them guys super-size me a combo
Kn-kn-know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo
In the Middle East on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, (Rambo!), Liberace (tango!)
Swingin on the vine, mango (Mango?)
So call me Simba, little mama, cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that chopper, just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin' blaka motherfucker
Got that big, rocket launcher!

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back, ayy

G-got 'em runnin', r-runnin'
Now tell them rap bitches that Nicki said this:
"We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta!"

[Interlude: Sean Garrett]
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta

[Chorus: Dave Patten]
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
But I don't let it stop me you know I'll be back again
All the mistakes I've made, trouble that I've been in
It shaped me into the person you see standin' here
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah
Up to third grade it was all As, fourth and fifth grade was the hard days
Detention and suspension was an always, by the time high school it was the hallways
Them was the wish I had a car days, 'cause all the stewards that was trapping they was all payed
And we was all broke, that's when the law broke
Cops catch us wouldn't say a word like our jaw broke
Picture me back then, look at me right now
Preforming in front of twenty thousand on the mic now
I caught a couple cases, I had to pipe down
Was living in the dark I'm in the light now
You grind hard, then you shine harder
I'm going hard like my last name Carter, Dwayne, Sean, and Vin
Who'll play my life if I be born again

[Chorus: Dave Patten]
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
But I don't let it stop me you know I'll be back again
All the mistakes I've made, trouble that I've been in
It shaped me into the person you see standin' here
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me

[Verse 2: Dave Patten]
Yeah, don't have to listen to me, you don't have to believe a single word I say
No, that's what my mother told me, still I went out and learned everything the hard way
And I've been crying, no no, I've been crying, no no
Oh yeah, she told me to grow up, I grew up and stood up now each day I move up again
I got a minute to say what I want, trying to make for everything that I've done wrong
But that made me who I am, and if I broke your heart, well I'm sorry again

[Chorus: Dave Patten]
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
But I don't let it stop me you know I'll be back again
All the mistakes I've made, trouble that I've been in
It shaped me into the person you see standin' here
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Thinking back when I was in the trap
Without a dollar to my name, I wasn't thinking rap
Niggas say I change, ask what I think of that
I say change for the better, I'm never thinking back
I should be a power forward
Shitting so much I think my toilet outta order
Take 'em out the box they like a fish up out the water
But me, I'ma survive, put that on my Ma swear to God
How you gonna win when you never try
I can see my future like I'm living in a mirage
Everyday I'm living life like I could never die
Old clothes in my closet, new whips in my garage
New chick in my bedroom, old chick by my side
New watch on my wrist saying this is my time
So don't judge me, just love me
Their is nothing above me
My future so pretty, say God don't like ugly

[Chorus: Dave Patten]
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
But I don't let it stop me you know I'll be back again
All the mistakes I've made, trouble that I've been in
It shaped me into the person you see standin' here
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me

[Intro]
Yeah
I tried talk to 'em

[Verse 1]
Quit talkin', I'ma hang you by your tongue, yeah
Any motormouth could get hung high
We don't fuck with niggas like fungi, we don't even hear ya
Hollerin' bullshit, nigga, cut the diarrhea (Get 'em)
Pistol lie inside of the armrest (Yeah), um, yes
Lay a nigga down in his own mess (Yeah), don't mess
Player fuck around with the homeless (Yeah), charmless
You can leave out here armless, no homies (Go)
Honest, you niggas is harmless
I'm calm as a don is supposed to (Be), Cosa Nostra
Don't ever approach him (Nah), don't get close to him (Uh-uh)
Shootouts ain't nothin' but rock and roll to him (Damn)
Leave your blood on the dash', call it rosewood (Ugh)
'Nother murder, 'nother page out the notebook
It ain't nothing and don't make it if you no good
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

[Chorus]
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em, but I hit 'em up
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em (Yo)

[Verse 2]
Take them shoes off your teeth, stop runnin' your mouth
No shoes, no feet, I'll run in your mouth (Huh)
I'll come to your house, me and my goons
Loadin' up bangers, ridin' under the moon (Yeah)
Throwing up fingers, saying, "My side rule" (Yeah)
If a nigga disagree, that's when my side prove (Get 'em), yeah
That Maybach coupe a cockeyed fool
And I'm in it like Bennett, ho, aren't I cool?
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move (Uh-oh)
Then the attitude switch and that heat'll move
I got that Chiquita banana clip for the tool
Meet a disaster, pity the fool
Eat a catastrophe, swallow the truth
Belch reality, how does it taste?
Powder your face, you a bitch, nigga
All pussy, stop comin' out your lips, nigga
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

[Chorus]
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em, but I hit 'em up
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em

[Verse 3]
Real talk, boy, chill with the talk, boy (Yeah)
That Tommy gun'll tear your neighborhood apart, boy (Blatt)
Yeah, leave your feelings in your heart, boy
You start with the wrong boy, it end with a song, boy (Oh)
With your friends to carry you along
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone (Yeah)
Fuck the discussion, I ain't into it, boy
I just get to it, let's do it, rip through a boy (Bah)
Big Uzi, just shoot a boy (Brr)
I'm inside looking out, you just an intruder, boy (Get 'em)
You need sutures on your smoochers, boy, but
I tried talk to 'em, but then a nigga had to

[Chorus]
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, really I was tryna be calm
But uh, that chopper rock, put his head in his arms
And man, I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, fuck it, make a nigga get loose
He had too much talk and not enough proof
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em up, hit 'em up
I ain't even wanna hit 'em, but I hit 'em up
I tried talk to 'em, I tried talk to 'em

Get a couple of philly’s and some waters for these hoes stomach
I keep ‘em rollin’ like no brakes up in that four runner
I don’t stop, I’m on the clock like the smallest hands
Just look for me, I move the bass up out that marching band
That ain’t a coffee can, nigga that 400 grands
I keep the block jumpin’, just call me bunny man
T make a blunt look like a arm without a fuckin’ hand
Fee break a pound straight down like a bucket man
You could get it harder or get it lighter than a summer tan
The section leader over the stove like a drummer man
Brr-at-at-tat, whip it up just like that, that
But if a nigga fuck with me wrong then its Brr-at-at-at-dat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I like my whip so old and my top better fold

[Intro: La the Darkman, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Dedication 3!
Aww
Yeah
This what y'all asked for!
L-A-D!

[Verse 1: La the Darkman, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
I'm all about that cheese, swiss or mozzarella
Muenster, Colby, American, or cheddar
When it come to robbery, nobody do it better
Notorious L.A.D., fresh Coogi sweater (Gangsta Gri-Zillz! Yeah)
The cleanest, lyrics is the meanest
Understand my English, nigga, I'm a genius
Ice like a snow cone, writing in my iPhone
Went from selling crack to selling ringtones
Straight out the projects to million-dollar homes
Inside The Carter, cooking 36 zones
Thirty-six O's, and I break 'em all down
In and out of every trap, all through the A-Town (Ill!)
The Embassy, AMG, Young Money merger
I'm a young champ Like Ben Roethlisberger (AMG!)
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension, pow! (Gangsta!)

[Verse 2: Jae Millz, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
I don't need nothing but my niggas and enough weed to go around
A tinted sedan, some grams, and a loaded pound
Fuck what another nigga think of me
I'm thinking multimillions, he thinkin' Gs (Oh!)
Nigga, please—get your mind right
Fuck tryna be fresh—get your grind right
'Cause I'm like, so in another league
I throw my pitches at different degrees
And I spiral my pigskins at different speeds
And I hit threes, 'cause at different times, I release
My shot cold, nigga, I'm hot, don't be tight 'cause you not
Just be happy I'm letting you breathe
I'm the good, I'm the bad, I'm the devil, I'm Jesus
It's Young Money, bitch, the game needs us
Gudda Gudda, what it is nigga?
Kidd Kidd and Sean, get it how you live, nigga
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealership
And Weezy just ripped the drop Phantom, so they feelin' sick
Diamond rings, diamond chains, royal suites
Private planes, palm trees, big change, I can't complain
I made a promise to myself that I'd never be a have-not
Nigga, fuck being broke, shit
Before that day come, I'll A-K stamp you
When there's beef, I'm in the center like Tyson Chandler
Fuck what you heard, in the booth, I goes off like the lights if you ain't pay and it's the third
And you already two months late with your bill
Clown nigga, you's a lame, bitch nigga, I'm Millz, Young Mula (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Ugh, if you didn't, now you know
It's the million-dollar nigga with the million-dollar flow
Icicle chain got a million-dollar glow
Quarter-mil' for the gang if you tryn' book a show
Temp plates on the Bentley, ridin' through the 'jects
Got a pocket full of money, nigga, hand on my Tec
I'm demanding respect, I'm a man to respect
Disrespect your man, put my hand 'round his neck
It's no other than Gudda Gudda, man
Still 'bout my money, nigga, fuck another man
I'm on the paper chase, all about the hustle, man
I be climbing through your window like I'm fucking Bruh Man
Look, I'm Shady-Aftermath, put your head in the scope
A bankroll of bucks is what these young niggas killing for
The game dirty on the streets, tryna deal yayo
Fifty clips at his hat, leave a peeled potato

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne & DJ drops]
I call my nina "bay," like San Diego
Get me twisted, and I'ma turn into a tornado
And all my riders riding like a Winnebago
You stay, but I'ma let that A-K go
Rawer than a 'qualone
Shoot you like "Halo," give your ass a halo
These bitches walk around acting like they J-Lo
But man, I remember when these bitches was just "Hey, ho" (Gangsta!)
"Hey ho, how you doing?" Me, I'm doing every fucking thing
Smokin' them dykes, I'm on that Mary-fucking-Jane (Gangsta!)
This shit so "Tom and Jerry" to Lil Wayne
And you MCs are just "milk and cherries" to Lil Wayne
Haha! And bitch, I'm greedy
But if I keep eatin' you rappers, I'll get sugar-diabetes
Sweetie, I'm a different species
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces
What the fuck do I be thinking?
"Kill, kill, murder, and Benjamin Franklin"
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas
And me—being a gangsta, I get into your girlfriend (Gangsta!)
I stay still when the world spins
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman
You heard me? You heard him? "Him" being me
And we are better than all y'all bitches, niggas, hoes
Enemies, foes, threes, twos, ones
But these dudes won

[Outro: Lil Wayne & DJ drops]
Dramatic!
Won
Dramatic, nigga!
The South, for real
Haha!
But not "one," 'cause, "Dedication 3," technically
Shout-out to the Dunk Ryders
Special, I fold that red flag
Right pocket, all the time
Yeah, Young Mula, baby
Gangsta Gri-Zillz!

[Intro]
Pay attention, biatch (Uh-huh)
Shout out Young Steff for the assistance (Yeah)
Scotty the engineer, what up?
All my niggas throwin' it up on them bikes, I see you
The affiliates, nigga
Nicki I told you I got you, baby, Gucci got you, baby
Weezy got you, we gon' hold you down, get 'em
Holiday season

[Verse 1]
She said, "Fuck Fendi", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch, fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up ThisIs50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Nothing I do is good enough for you

[Verse 2]
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
'Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
– Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches

[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi (I'ma keep my eyes on the price, oh, oh)
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz

[Verse 1]
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

[Chorus]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

[Verse 2]
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

[Bridge]
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Oh, the bird that’s flown into my room

[Chorus]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

[Intro]
Do do do do do do
Do do do do
Yeah
La la la la la la
La la la la

[Chorus]
Did you get my card?
Did you read my love letter?
Did it touch your heart?
When you read my love letter

[Verse 1]
Sunny days, smiling face
Spirit filled, heaven praised
Memories in my mind
Reminiscing of good times
Miracles, so amazed
Soldiers far away
It makes me ask the question, babe

[Chorus]
Did you get my card? (uh)
Did you read my love letter? (yeah)
Did it touch your heart? (yeah baby)
When you read my love letter
(when you read my love letter)

[Verse 2]
Weekends and birthdays
Celebration, holidays
Love making history
A toast to our victories
Sweet dreams, butterflies
Holding hands, side by side
Best friends, families
Reminds me

[Chorus]
Did you get my card? (my card)
(did you get my card girl?)
Did you read my love letter?
(tell me did you read my love letter?)
Did it touch your heart?
(did it touch your heart?)
When you read my love letter
(when you read my love letter, babe)

[Verse 3]
Cocktails, happy hours
Wedding bells, baby showers
Vacations, sailboats
With the ones you love the most
Long time no see
Back together you and me
Write me back when you receive this here

[Chorus]
Did you get my card? (yeah)
(did you get my card?)
Did you read my love letter?
(did you read my love letter?)
Did it touch your heart?
(tell me, did it touch your heart?)
When you read my love letter
(girl, when you read my love letter)

[Verse 4]
I hope these
Hope these words find you in the perfect mood
I wrote this letter according to my love for you
So I hope this paper will travel safely to where you are
Because the melody is custom made for your heart
Though near or far I will find a way to send my love
Only pray that it don’t come back return to sender
If you are reading this I hope that things are well
And you can text me back, you can write me back
Just check your mail

[Chorus]
Did you get my card?
(did you get my card, yeah?)
Did you read my love letter?
(girl tell me)
Did it touch your heart?
(when you read)
When you read my love letter
(my love, my love)

[Chorus]
Did you get my card?
(did it make you smile, yeah?)
Did you read my love letter?
(did it lift you up, yeah?)
Did it touch your heart?
(did it make you wanna write me back, baby?)
When you read my love letter
(when you got my love letter)

[Outro]
All the ladies sing for me
Do do do do do do
Do do do do
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ladies sing
La la la la la la
La la la la

[Verse 1]
Now when I say 2-0, you say
Nah, you know the rest
This is our scene
Our music, our movement, the history lives through us
I write to the beat and let life play the guitar strings
Despite the drama, there's respect and camaraderie
Every time one of my friends is mentioned in My Philosophy
It's a rite of passage, I'm not trying to be corny
I got love for Sportn' Life, Alpha P, Massline, and Onry
Every time somebody steps out on the road
They bring a little Northwest soul with them, amen
Alright then, just so you know
I try to carry that every time that I rock a show
So, turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
It's Good Medicine that Chief Sealth would've been proud of
Sends our city, town pride, heart, blood, sweat, tears, I-5
North, South side, vibe, live, ride down these city blocks
And never will be stopped
They tryin' to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr. Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance?
Music it saves lives, these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form we've learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know what's up
Yup, and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers, but became through my music
Take that away, that's a vital
14 Fathoms Deep, Do the Math, Tribal
My greatest teachers: B-Self and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out, no matter how hard it rains

[Hook]
Northwest, making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do, coming to my side
I mean I like how y'all do
Thank you, but we onto new
Put it down for the town with music
Making you feel the vibe
Check how Seattle do, coming to my side
When my peeps know my crew bring the flame
Put it down for the town
Wearing that Seattle blue

[Verse 2]
That's right, when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneaking in 'cause they're broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needing to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it, alright?
I get on stage, style, share my whole life
Try to reach 'em at the bar where they're drinking Miller Lite
But the kids in the front, they bring out the passion, dude
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask 'em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hands clasped, forgot when they weren't too cool to be a fan, damn
Hatin' at the concert
You don't remember RKCNDY, watching Heiro, or vibing out to Alkaholiks
I know it's not the same, it never will be
But my, my, my, my city's filthy
And we've been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin' in Sir Mixalot's video
Back when Scene was rockin' house parties on the floor
JMG's, Sit N' Spin, and The Paradox
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here, so much has not
I was just a kid hopin' I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter who'll give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected, they would connect with it
Now looking over the city's the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm
It's like my city stands still, the world looks on
If I could only capture its beauty and put it in a song

[Intro: Biggie and Diddy]

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, when the la-la hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that your hat can't fit you
Either I'm with ya or against ya
Format bent 'cha, back through that maze I sent ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Nigga with the game tight, fifth that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-A-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed, sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sipping on booze in the House of Blues

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Stevie J)]
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
If I got to choose a coast, I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving L.A props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Stevie J)]
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits?
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. (Stevie J)]
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali)

[Intro]
When I met you woman
I couldn't help but notice a face so beautiful
Now imagine, the faces you would make if we ever made love
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Pulled up in the drop top Benz
Hit the horn two times and you walked outside
Dress keep hugging them thighs and the only thing inside my mind is
I want you, yes I do, and if there's anything you suggest I do, then tell me
Now we all in the crib on my sofa
Girl, I'm so glad you came over
I wanna tell you, "Come closer"
But I don't know if you feel, like I feel, tell me, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't it feel good when I touch on it?
Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you?
Come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be

[Chorus]
Making love faces
Making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burning
Messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
Making love faces
Making love faces
My hands rubbing on your skin
Let's go hard, don't hold it in

[Verse 2]
Girl, let me wrap my hands around you
So happy ever since I found you
Just like a kid who found some candy, let me feel and find your panties
Take 'em off, take em off, take 'em off take 'em off please
Oh down on my knees
Oh, you're right in front of me
Don't have to pay for my attention, can you hear me? Is you listening?
Baby, be real with me, I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't it feel good when I touch on it?
Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you?
Come kiss me, come with me, down the hall to my bedroom
Tonight we'll be

[Chorus]
Making love faces
Making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burning
Messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
Making love faces
Making love faces
My hands rubbing on your skin
Let's go hard, don't hold it in

[Bridge]
The way you bite your lip is that your way of telling me you like it? Mmhmm
If I'm the best you ever had girl, in your life, say mmhmm
And when your eyes roll back in your head, the shaking in your legs
Mmhmm, mmhmm, that's what she said

[Chorus]
Making love faces
Making love faces
Shadows on the wall while the candles burning
Messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
Making love faces, let the people sing
Making love faces
My hands rubbing on your skin
Let's go hard, don't hold it in, love faces

[Verse 1]
Last night I let the party get the best of me
Waking up in the morning, two hoes laying next to me
Plus I heard an officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks
That's the motherfucking recipe
Nigga and we roll deep, so deep
It's going down in this bitch; concrete
We gon' party all night, no sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everything is on me

[Pre-Hook 1]
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we don't see the whole suite
Then fly to a level where you gon' need your own key
T—G—O—D

[Hook]
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

[Verse 2]
Leaving from the club, now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for
Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar
Every time I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggas in the game, but they ain't playin' wit us
They ain’t paying enough
Man, them niggas ain't ballin'
They just laying it up
Saying they does
I'm just rolling hella weed up
While on my way to the club
I had to wait at the club
But now I don't
Cause everything is on me

[Pre-Hook 2]
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we see the whole street
We fly, I mean so fly we need a whole wing
T—G—O—D

[Hook]
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

[Bridge]
Party all day, party all night

Say you wanna party, lets party alright, I

[Hook]

Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

[Outro]
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let’s party alright

[Verse 1]
When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericks'll change
A different hook, the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance, more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when it's sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a 'T' and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And it's worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like 'poof', the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy, the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became
So

[Hook]
Wherefore does my glory go?
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)
Wherefore does my glory go?(Wherefore does my glory go?)
Wherefore does my glory go? (Glory, glory)

[Verse 2]
But you gotta understand, our differences is the same
What starts in clouded minds, finishes in the reign
Of the fools that are used as instruments in the game
Where oppression is the queen and ignorance is the king
Where revolution is dead, no candles in its memory
No remembrance of its fame, just a mystery
No mentioning the history of the chain, the enemy
No hennessy sentiments in its name
Just an unmarked grave that menaces have defamed
With the propaganda, and images of the gangs
A lost art, no apprentices in it trained
And they brainwashed, no interest in its stain
And the minds weary, all the adrenaline in it drained
While the wrecking ball is, disassembling things
Her highness is the cause, his eminence is the blame
The pride is still there, the privileges still remain, but

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And you've gotta respect the position in which you playing
Never let your heart reflect the conditions in which its staying
Even if it's dark, and the temperature is the same
As winters in the Ukraine, your appendages is in chains
Have forgiveness from the start, keep maliciousness restrained
Be smart, never indiscriminate in your aim
'Cos there's innocent witnesses oblivious to the things
That come, the one's the hypnotists keep entertained
And you can't arc, have some resilience in your frame
Stay resistant, and committed to what you sing, 'cos
They'll flip it the minute that you refrain
Read the book and the lines, and literature in between
You gotta be educated when going against the grain
Pay attention, they illegitimate in their claims
They assisted in the killing and pillaging
In addition to the addiction
Shit is much bigger than just them planes, but

[Hook]

[Outro]
Wherefore does my glory go?
(Is it on TV? Yeah)
Wherefore does my glory go?
(Maybe it's on a CD?)
Wherefore does my glory go?
(Do you see it when you look at me?)

[Intro: Floyd Mayweather Jr.]
What's up Luda?
It's your trainer, Money Mayweather
Tell them other MC's to put their motherfuckin mics down
Cause you the truth, it's round one
Dedication, hard work, prayers and belief
And a good team {*ding ding*}

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, back up on that ass (yeah)
Back to put rappers on one knee like they 'bout to run 100 meter dash
Bow down to greatness
Before I get pissed and run up in the stands like the Indiana Pacers
Covered all my bases, straight, no chasers
Diamonds on my chain look like my neck's full of glaciers
Titanic flow (what?) Titanic dough (what?)
Women on my nuts like, "Where the Titanic go?!"
I been scourin the Earth (yeah)
Makin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church
And the fat lady's singin - it's over for you rappers
Can't none of y'all bust, you're just sacs full of semen
And I got the women screamin (AHHH!)
They could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my name's Willie Beamen
Or LL Cool - so if your boyfriend
Thinks you loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool
Got jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist (hey!)
Iconic status and his name is Ludacris
Bitch please! You messin with some real O.G.'s
With million dollar whips that I ship from overseas
Got a pocket full of G's - and the inconvenient truth
Is that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin' all the trees
The globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt
And put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts
What you want from me? (what?) I got pistols for the haters
Your fam'll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders
And your music isn't favored - and DJ's they NEVER bring it back
Like when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors
Like a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt
The name of my car insurance is "YO' FUCKIN FAULT!"
And if you sittin' on chrome - I'll call up my boys
And have you stripped of yo' metals like Marion Jones, nigga

[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.] + (Ludacris)
Champ you got it! Keep on movin
They ain't got nothin on you, watch for the sneak dissin
These boys'll smile in your face and stab you right in the back (I know)
Bring it, take some water
This is Money in the bank! (yeah)
They defeatin themselves, champ (yeah baby)
You know what you can do (I know)
You Luda! You lookin good, let's go! (aight)
C'mon baby, hard work and dedication (yeah)
You know what it is man (aight let's go)
{*ding ding ding*} Keep fightin!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, back up on the scene (what?)
Back to put a nail in these rappers' coffins
I got the hammer in my jeans: call me Mr. Fix It
Barrel stay hotter than
A fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits
A-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket
Luda leaves intruders stretched out like gymnastics
And acrobatics; I'm superstar status
The mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards!
The international traveler
And I may not be much to you, but I'm the SHIT out in Africa
So put ya fist up - even the Statue of Liberty
Lit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up
You can't compete with me - I got 'em stuck
Like I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me
And then I broke free - I'll let 'em loose
When Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free
I'm the baddest mother-shut-it like Shaft was
Leavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs
They shoulda warned ya - you got defeated
By the Heat, but ehh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya
So call the coroner (hey!)
I'll show up to yo' funeral with some gators like I'm FRESH outta Florida
Call me The Swamp Thang - y'all headed in the wrong direction
Like you hit the subway and caught the wrong train
So don't fuck with it - I'm sendin' lyrical bullets
Right at yo' dome, fuck niggas better duck with it (duck wit it!)
Or else you stuck with it - you'll get stomped so bad
You'll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it
But not in Ca$hville - you lost yo' feelin
Like comin' down off X, chasin' effects of yo last pill (ha ha)
You fuckin' Daffodil, you's a Daffy Duck (what?)
And I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!

[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.]
Ha ha ha ha!
I told these muh'fuckers can't fuck with you and me man
I'm the best of the best, the head honcho
The el hombre intachable, man
You know what the business is, they can't fuck with me man
You know what my lifestyle is
Man you know what I do, you can't fuck with me man
What, a decade? What?
I'll go ten more, they can't fuck with me man
Lifestyle, you know what it is
Gettin money man, let's go

[Outro: Ludacris]
Yeah baby, yeahhhh!
I'm the champ! Undisputed, WHAT?
Who wants some? Ha ha ha... whoo!
I wish a muh'fucker would

I give it to her all night, so she don’t wanna leave (It's your young nigga, Wiz)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Wiz Khalifa]
If you got that bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb (Oh-woah)
Know you got that bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb (Oh-woah)
Ladies put your hands up if you that bomb-bomb (Oh-woah, yeah)
Girl, you got that bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb-bomb (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Hold up kimosabe, my crib look like a lobby
I'm in that black Bugatti and I'm off that Carlo Rossi
I'm-I'm-I'm with that Taylor possé, these ladies wanna party
And there's so much ice up on my neck, it look like I play hockey
So hold up, nigga, stop me, all these haters watch me
I give her the pill and the D, you can call me cocky
Any stage or any beat, you know I'ma body
And Wiz, roll that good shit up and he ridin' shotty (Bloaw!)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
You know shawty thick in her hips, cold than a mother (Okay)
Lickin' her lips, a bad mothersucker (Hahahaha)
Apple lookin' so ripe, she make me want a piece (Hahaha, you know)
I give it to her all night, so she don’t wanna leave (Yeah, leggo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you got that bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb (Oh-woah)
Know you got that bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb (Oh-woah)
Ladies put your hands up if you that bomb-bomb (Oh-woah)
Girl, you got that bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bomb-bomb-bomb (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yup, so when your good smell like that good weed, man, blame it on me
Don't even blame Breezy, man, blame that shit on me man
Hahahahaha, yup

[Verse 1]
White bitches, white girls, white drugs
Black girls don't do it but my type does
Fuck it in my white van, beat her with a nice white nightstand
Until I give her gashes where it's nothin' but the white meat
E-T-I-H, W's, double D's on her knees
White gargle yellow fuckin' bumblebees
Use whitey's as my dinner course for intercourse
So much fuckin' white make Darth Vader have a thinner force
But of course, I'm the white boy that shows no remorse
Pull up on a stark with enough white to kill a horse
Blacc Friday, fuck a Nigga Friday, umm
Wolf Gang make a white pregnant bitch wan' abort
Bring the remainin' red and white pieces to the fort
Odd Future, there wolves bang where a couple bears hang
With a white box logo with a couple stains
From a black creampie in a whitey, make it light gray

[Verse 2]
Oh wow, Obilivion stump
I do not know how that dead body got inside of my trunk
What the fuck? Gee Willikers and no, I'm not drunk
I coulda sworn that Budweiser can read fruit punch
Let you sip casually when you tryna lose calories
I'm not a murderer, this occurance that isn't happenin'
Is sporadically damagin' my reputation
See I'm a good guy but when I see dead casualties
My penis gets erected and nipples are such aroused
And the blouses of these bitches always end up in my house
And three hours in the showers with the corpse
I've ejaculated enough semen to sink a boat what, umm
Riley's body's entirely covered and tied up
From my desire, now look at the fuckin' irony
I killed my manager with an iron
All because the bitch finally decided to fire me
Back at Travis' house even though that faggot admires me
All because I heard that he was talkin' to Danielle
So now that I finally made that fags head handheld
He can finally help me masturbate and read fan mail (no homo)
First letter says motherfucker you're dead
The king of comedy heard everythin' that you said
And Just in Time your head is mine
You crossed the fuckin' line like them dirty Mexicans
Second letter reads: "Hey son, it's me"
Fuck you, I'm a subject without my permission
Third letter quote hey Ace I'm addicted to coke
Wanna ask how I been so?
I make songs about shit for attention
Put them out randomly hopin' that I get some
I got problems in my head that I want, no
But I don't trust anybody, yeah no one
Savin' up 24 bullets with gun
Cause I got demons that I cannot let out, umm
Hopefully the next album can help me out
Cause I'm now, livin' this life with foolproof doubts
So, I just need someone to talk to, kinda rushed
But nobody gives a fuck, fuck it, signed anonymous

Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus: Drake]
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

[Chorus: Drake & Lloyd]
Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Verse 1: André 3000]
You ain't a hater? Can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealing with ain't nutty but the study gon' unveil
My relative in jail, ha! Stay engaged
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper but I'm tangled in my cord (hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsels in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right
But hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category, ain't got none, you know I'm right

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded nigga, so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone filling out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firing on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue; 'cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin' yo' ass with words, fool
Slam yo' back to the curb, bruh, a sanitation worker
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go 'head recycle, repackage then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No JR period, senior, 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biological's intact
Talk bad about the fam, catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction, Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, Caine, I want you to go out there
Kill them marks and come back, is you with me?
Mighty ighty ighty ighty ighty ighty O
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobody's slow

Oh-na-na-na, na-na

[Verse 1 - Mack Maine]
Young Maine for President
I'll probably paint the White House black if it was my residence
Bush back in office, some niggas feel that's irrelevant
Cause they still pedalin' this medicine, but anyway, anyday
I can zurk off quick and make my semi spray
Send some of my men away just to blow your men away
Stephon Marbury type bullets, they like the penetrate
Young Money, we outta school, but we got chemistry
Young Spitta, Young Maine, Young Cop, Young Mobb, Tez Poe
We don't pass the rock nigga, we ball hog
Mad slow in the Escalade nigga, y'all all fall
Jack your fresh ass Caddy and steal your white walls
Nigga, we don't like y'all
Hell yeah, we will fight y'all
We ain't on no Tyson shit
We ain't tryna' bite y'all
Knuckin' if you buckin', probably bustin' at your cousin
How youngins' that spout something
Y'all niggas ain't 'bout nothin'

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Nigga we bussin', and bussin', to the bang of buss
No, we don't run for the Olympics, but the flame with us
I got that tussin', that scummy, and that angel dust
So pick your high, I will supply and correct changes, what's up
We bring the bussin', we bussin' like this thang for us
You niggas is sleeveless man, you can't hang with us
I got a bitch who speak Spanglish
She keep her bangles danglin'
And the cocaine is right up in her anus
Old Wayne is right up in the spot where he supposed to
Be, got Hova at the game and now he coachin'
Me, but I've been the champion, happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the Hamptons like, what the fuck is a hammock
The chef up in the kitchen like, what the fuck is a sammich
I'm like, we gotta find middle ground, we need balance
Challenge me, that be to my advantage
I'm outstanding, like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed
Serving nicklebags in Iraq, bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black, if I wreck, bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day and drive it crazier
The seats will be lazier, shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Wavin' at her at 2 crazy, Fugazis, I'm too brazen, 3 brazees deep
We got .380s and P80
9s, 9s, M-10ss and M1s and 12 gauges
Shell cases, money put up for jail cases, bail make it
My momma say, tuck your chain son, they'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces, like
I'll be damned momma, they know who I am momma
I'm still your little boy, but to them, I'm the man momma
Fuck with your boy, man Hollygrove the hood, nigga
Throw it in your face 'til you get that understood

[Verse 3 - Curren$y]
Niggas know I'm heavy with the coke, with the coke
In the Impala SS and sittin' heavy on the spokes
Never am I broke man, I'm playin with some change
I get a nigga soaked like he playing in the rain
And everywhere I go, a ho starin' at my chain
I'm the most valuable player in the game
All these haters wanna ride me
Cause I got more kicks than niggas with black belts in karate
Keep a redbone with a real nice body
Just copped a 'Lac and a yellow Maserati
Niggas ain't fuckin with the dawg
When Young Money shoppin', we don't leave nothing in the mall
These niggas ain't as rich as us
Man your rims too small, get your motherfucking inches up
Cause I copped me a Benz today
Just to go on 106 & Park and hand the keys over to Free and AJ
Yeah

[Intro]
You know, it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj, hahaha, oh

[Verse 1]
I ain't know the president live in DC
And I ain't know they call me Nicki Lewinsky
I never knew that dude with Jay was Pimp C
And I ain't know I be with Paris and Lindsay
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
I fly girl pop up, and I fly girl dip
I fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip
And I don't never guzzle it, I fly girl sip

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that Rosé, get that, get that Rosé
A little Hennessy and Louis the 13th
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all my haters 'cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now, c'yeah

[Chorus]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do

[Refrain]
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfuckin' DJ
If he don't p-p-pull up, let the record replay
Record replay, r-r-record replay
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfuckin' DJ

[Verse 2]
I ain't know the police was the Babylon
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties was bigger than Pamela
So paparazzi flicking, be flicking their camera
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball, with my fly girl mitts
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Now get that OJ, get that, get that OJ
A little cranberry and some Rémy Moné
Now everybody look my way, my way
Excuse all the haters cause they looking sideways
Let's get it now, c'yeah

[Chorus]
You got me wrong
You be sittin' by the bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it, but you do
You do, you do, do, do, do, do

[Refrain]
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfuckin' DJ
If he don't pull up let the record replay
Record replay, record replay
I think I'm gonna kill the motherfuckin' DJ

[Bridge]
Oh, fuck 'em like sexin', why they be flexing

Damn, them bitches got me wrong
Got me wrong wrong wrong

These bitches got me wrong

[Chorus]
You, you, you, you, you got me wrong

[Outro]
You got me wrong (Kill the motherfuckin' DJ)

You can act like you don't like it but you do (Pull up, let the record replay)
You do, you do, do, do, do, do  (Pull up, let the record replay)

[Hook]
And somebody tell me, where do I go from now (x4)

[Intro]
I've been lost, you know?
Oh, you know? I didn't know... didn't know at all

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I just wanted to use computers
I made it to the finish line first, but Lu's a loser
I wanted to watch so I turned to rocks
Like Medusa, the block, the users
The rock, the shooters, the shots, the heckle of cops
The lugers, the Glocks, the cougars
Should be with my Akhs, making Salat in the Ummah
But instead I'm on the block in this lot with the Kufi's
And I'm feeling like a doofus, I think I understand the meaning of life
And really ain't no reason for ice, still want it
Still haunted by the demon, a price
But if u give it to me we'll flaunt it
I think niggas is dead broke, and I can bring em to life, its funny how--
Naw it really ain't funny sometimes I hate money
Please God take from me

[Hook]

All my blessings, I take em as a lesson
Make 'em into questions, and relate 'em to the present
Should I take it as a present? A penalty?
But everything's from the man upstairs
Could barely sing cuz the man upstairs is beating on the floor
When the music stops will I have a chair?
Will I be seated on the floor
It really don't matter cat beat me to the score
I was speaking to this whore
You know I got trouble with women humble beginnings
Mumblin and tremblin now they smugglin and stealing
Step ya game up check the dame what?
I nutted on her fangs ain't nuthin to hang up
That really happened in fact but I ain't manufactured for that
A bumpy ride had to fasten my straps
I be tryna reach em, other niggas be lyin:
Dyin' to get behind and beat 'em
I just be tryna teach 'em

[Hook]

I put it on paper, cuz they'll put you on for paper
But most of these niggas is paper
10 1/2 by 8 blue lines 3 holes
Hit they ass wit 8's, flat lined, 3 holes
Cuz they'll gas u up like cold pacer
And leave u in the cold without a coat with a cold
Thats not gangsta them niggas ain't ya boys man
Them niggas is the poison gotta keep em under the sink
Right next to the bleach I say that I'm on top of my game
Cuz if you under you sink
I wonder if its just the hunger you think? imagine that til it haunts you
Them niggas want you to fall, I fall cuz I want to
Yellow leaves and felonies that's how I fell on these
God made my head with mind in it
They made my bread with swine in it
Made my bed and now im lyin in it
I wonder if this is my limit

[Hook]

[Produced by Mr. Porter]

[Intro]
Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"
I said, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, bitch, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for ya
When I torture ya throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, bitch, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior deteriorate like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake for fisherman's sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake every diss you can take
Personal, we ain't friends tryin' to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate, you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

[Hook: Thyme]
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic, man, and said that you can flow?
Point him out, bitch, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"

[Outro: Thyme]
Whoooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?!
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
"I wanna know, wanna know"
(Ayo, let me get that mic, man!)
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
Who the fuck passed you the mic, man?!
(I got the rhymes, bitch, I'll kick that shit!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Chorus: (x4)

[Produced by Eminem & Mr. Porter]

[Intro: Maxine & Denuan Porter]
Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother
And unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just… slows… down…
And then speeds back to a regular pace
There is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry
But you keep on actin' strangely

[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week
She was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said: "Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?"
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Throughout my hands, and said: "Oh, it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said: "Maxine, check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things"
What the fuck are you doin'?
So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said: "3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass"
I said "What is it? Another nigga? It's okay"
She said: "No I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem."

[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third, nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see…
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately

[Refrain: Drake]
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls

[Refrain: Drake]
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 3: Drake]
Check
And nowadays, some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it, see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing, ger reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me

[Refrain: Drake]
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Intro: Nickelus F]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
Umm Hello world I'm your motherfucking troublemaker
Hello world I'm your motherfucking troublemaker
I ain't a peacemaker, I'm the peacetaker
I'm very destructive, watch me break you
Yeah, I love to smell that blood, bitch
Call me the devil what the hell that was
Yeah and you can call me young money streets
And you can see me for all the young money beef
I'm the troublemaker

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Call me mr. kill 'em all
Bitch nigga don't get involved
Shoot you on the front porch
And knock you to the back yard
Knock your fucking back off
Knock your top rack off
You just see jill on the hill, I knocked jack off
But this ain't nursery
This is brain surgery
Ski mask on my bullets
Let em commit brain burglery
Emergency, it's an emergency
Someone in all black left the whole scene burgundy
Kamikaze you can try me I'mma shoot you
When the gun in this position you can call it Kama sutra
I'mma cock and do it like a motherfucking rooster
You pussy boy I'm your mutherfucking doucha
Haha, better run like bobby boucha
It's Weezy baby it's time to induce you
You think you're really safe in here
Stand up we about to take it there
And when we do we come for you to take your body
Where nobody else with eyes can see
And I told them don't start no shit won't be no shit
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
Don't start no shit won't be no shit
Three eighty With The Patato On The Head
Leave ya Lookin Like Ya Got A Crater On Ya Head

Young Money Lifetakers
Hello World Im Yo Muthafuckin Troublemaker
TROUBLEMAKER!
Hello World Im Yo Muthafuckin TroubleMake(x4)
Dont Start No Shit Won't Be No Shit.!

[Verse:]
He walk around town with a frown like Homey the Clown
Shelltoe Lee crown, well blow me down
Blow! Hell no, he sound funny
Outta bounds tryin'ta cop a pound with brown money
Keep the change, peep game, the Range
Inches on the fringes of a deep steepa' strange
Went and met a dread at the swine roast
Find him in the zone up ahead near the sign post
Follow the beat, you won't stumble
Shut your mouth, swallow your feet, or try'an rumble
In discreet they lie and mumble
Catch 'em in the street they as humble as Bryant Gumble cryin' fumble
Don't let him get the call
Keep a stack a diss rhymes, one-size-fits-all
Try ta' avoid the pitfall
Or else get hit in the eye with a old dry spitball
You must be crazy out ya mind
Even on the days he feel lazy he shout rhymes
No chains, no bridge, just get outshined
When he come blaze it people say it's about time
The old God with the old gold gold card
When he's on the road it's no-holds-barred
No lard, in the record game on some bull guard
So many nekked dames he might blow his whole wad
Ya learn somethin' new everyday
Go ahead and burn, they ain't nothin' to do anyway
'cept sell tracks out the Cheverolet like lemonade
And go gold in the hood so he can get ghetto paid
Now that's usin' the ol' cranium
Like the jewelry cat who sold him fake plat uranium
Guaranteed to turn necks green like the Hulk
Have it manufactured by machine in bulk
They rock 'n roll like: 'Stop, Drop . . .'
And if they got soul, then welcome to the sock hop
Hip-be-bop at ya block mom 'n pop shop
Timing when it comes to rhymin' is chop-chop
Keep it lit till the last stroke'a the pen
And ya don't quit like ya quit smokin' again
They said he keep his lyrics poked in a tin
And his secret recipe, soak it in some gin
Brings the heat like a radiator
Stays on beat with the mask like a gladiator
Sword is the mic cord
And he came to turn it out like a dyke broad out the psych ward
I recollect when he first took the sector
He use the connect-the-dot styles as a mic checka
Told him give the deposit, book the lecture
The crooked look wrecka, HOOKS IS EXTRA!!!

[Intro]
Haha
It's Mr. 305 checkin' in for the remix

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Yeah
Yeah
(Vicious, vicious)
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Kenna]
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
You think you can take me?
See this is what makes me (Come on)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I look into you toothless until you know what's your past
To try it, it would be stupid, your choice of technique is foolish
Battle be strong the new kid
Don’t matter my scars were leaking
I’ll be standing still demanding, I’ll be winner
Rapid punches delivered
Your soul is feeling weaker by the moment
I stood before opponents all my energy I’m holding
Victory to me you see those other main components
Pow Pow Pow I knock em down
I am flawless in every round

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Kenna]
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
You think you can take me?
See this is what makes me (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
No, no, no, I won't get bodied
My heart is powered with power from cowards
I may be tired from steppin up to a champion
Hit them up and break them down
I’m aiming to break some bones
I’m focused and overdosed on adrenaline
And I strengthen them with confidence
Every hit and every kick is rapid fire
And my thoughts is sour if I feel there is no lighter
Here, summon every single bit of courage
In my lion heart
They start it then I finish it
We’ll finish it

[Hook: Kid Cudi & Kenna]
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire (Ooh)
Hit for hit now, blow for blow (Come on)
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious (Vicious, vicious)
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow (Blow for blow)
You think you can take me?
See this is what makes me
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
You think you can take me?
See this is what makes me

[Intro]
This my last motherfuckin' freestyle dog
If you don't let me go first this time man, you'll have to wait 'til the album come out Monday
I'm tired man I'm sick and tired
I'm just a player player
Plus it's an exclusive KanyeToThe beat? C'mon man
Fuck around throw this on your instrumental shit too
This is what I'mma have to say

[Verse]
Niggas old as hell, trying to get they rapping on
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
I'm in the club, posted up, "Guess Who's Back" is on
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world, we all got your girl
Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back
They like "Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back!"
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins
Niggas popping out the woodworks, talking about "you owe me"
Mama, I'm famous, niggas hate me that don't know me

[Outro]
Yo, I know you all suprised and shit when you see me on MTV
But keep your eyes glued to...I don't know what channel that is out here
In Chicago that's Channel 7, ABC
You might fuck around see me on Oprah Winfrey or something
Matter of fact, true story, true story
Last week...I got a little cold right now, true story, though
I'm on 40th and like 5th or something
I see an SUV and the window rolled down and shit!
And this black lady from Chicago, she like
"Yo, um, I just bought one of these in black."
You know I just got the G5 or whatever
She like, "I just got one of these in black
How does it drive?"
I'm like, "it drive more like a truck than my last one."
I'm like, "yo, but I'm from Chicago, too. I wanna be on your show!"
She said "yo, well, oh, ok, well, who are you?"
And I told her, "I'm Kanye West, a rapper."

[Intro]
Hey! What's your name? Oh, that's nice
Me? I'm Wolf, you can call me Tyler though
I'm eighteen, you from around here?
Oh, you look like my next victim
I said you look like my ex-girlfriend, sister

[Verse 1]
While James is jamming on the mixer
We can play Twister naked
Don't be afraid, it's just a kiss
I'm open to everything if you're inviting your sister
That's another topic, we should start a project
You could be the lab rat, I could be the doctor
Let me drug you up and put different things in you
But I'm not gonna do that until you begin to pass out
Now I can draw your face up pretty
Or do it jackass and leave your breath all shitty
Or I can get the hand held and hold held titty
And stick my dick in you but that just might offend you
Teenage parties, I recommend you
Never get drunk with a nigga like us
But I kinda like your company
And you rubbing on my dick, yeah it comforts me
Fuck, condom pocket, luckily, I brought one
Herpes virus, yeah bitch, I fought one
I don't want you to have my permit yet
That I just haven't came up with a name yet
I got some new shit, well technically, I got a new dick
The other one fell off in a pulpit
A gay coaches' white grease and Chris Stokes
Blew the fuck up in gray clouds of thick smoke
Funny, right? Ha-ha, this shit's jokes
I got the idea from a letter that the shit wrote

[Hook]
Hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's dance
I said hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's fuck (rough)

[Verse 2]
Well, I have a gram cupcake mix
Mix a little syrup, it ain't no way to cure him
But I don't do the syrup, I just do the sniffles
Take a couple bits, bitch kibbles, bitch I gotta riddle
What can you tickle that can make a dinosaur giggle
I'm tryna get your puss, your pimple is a push
Away from the tush, I don't smoke kush
I don't do drugs, I don't even club
I don't drink beer, why the fuck am I here
The girls are really cute but there on X
And that's a better reason to for me to take advantage with sex
And you might be next, you pass out on
Me and your mouth drool, throw you in my van now it's carpool
Let you rest your ass on my dick like a barstool
Going deep like a scuba with the snorkle
You never gonna forgive me, but your so damn pretty
I'mma drop you off home quickly
You passed out, bitch you ain't even listening
And leave your house empty, your neighbors didn't see me
Your never gonna get me, your self respect were skimpy
You was up thirty, now you're down fifty
Abracadabra your memory I'm tricky
You are what I rob so I guess your pussy empty
Just like your home by taking the store of oreos
Over by the cabin of cheerios and the mint tea

[Interlude]
Yep. But.. I had fun, tonight..

[Hook]

[Intro]
Hm
Damn girl, where did you learn to do all that?
Ay, can I tell you something? Listen

[Verse 1]
Girl the sex was crazy, better yet amazing
Don't be sad, I ain't going nowhere, let's just lay and talk
Girl I know you feel it, this chemistry that we got
So don't be shy, I ain't going nowhere, I'm here for the night
So move closer, bring your body to mine, let me hold you right
Don't be mad, I ain't going nowhere, I'ma sleep here by your side

[Chorus]
You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I (Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you, so (Let's have pillow talk)
You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I (Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you, so (Let's have pillow talk)

[Verse 2]
When I saw you after my show, your friends were acting like hoes
But you were different, you weren't impressed by all my money or fancy shit
Girl your skin is so smooth, and you smell good just like some new shoes (Just like my Bathing Apes)
I see you smiling, is that a sign that you feeling me too? Girl I hope so

[Chorus]
You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I (Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you, so (Let's have pillow talk)

[Outro]
So move closer bring your body to mine
Just like my Bathing Apes

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Marley, I be you!
Shout-out Too Short
I'm going in
The Aphilliates, nigga! Holla at your boy

[Verse 1 (false starts): Lil Wayne]
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba, still working on her visa
Her girlfriend, Lisa—met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick but expect for me to eat her?
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba, still working on her visa
Her girlfriend, Lisa—met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick, but expect for me to eat her?
That ho crazy, man, you don't wanna meet her
But her homegirl, Nita, swallow cum by the liter
She look good in boy shorts and a beater
But this other girl, Quita, way sexier than Nita
I ain't lying—she the... hottest bitch, heater
But I'm a fucking freezer, yeah, I'ma fucking leave her
Yeah, I'm a fucking eagle, flyer and deeper
Smoke like a Cohiba, your ho give me cerebral
Now, get low and touch your toes for my people
And if you ain't fucking them, you ain't fucking me either
You think your man hot? Well, fuck it, me: ether
Heard I got guap, wanna kick it like FIFA
Every day Christmas 'cause I'm smoking that wreath-a
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I am Southern-land, not Kiefer
Y-M-E for "Young Money Entertainment," ha
Run, dummy, finna bang it
You want beef? Then my money will arrange it
I am not fucking finna aim it
But that Nina Ross shout for me when I'm angry
Yeah, Hollygrove, biatch
Sloppy like Joe, you better go get G-I
All my guns knee high, M-O-N-E-Y
That's what I rely on, I'm gone
"He high"—yep, I'm three-high
I'm just schoolin' these fucks like DeVry
College institution, finals and confusion
Stop with your excuses; hip-hop, I am seducin'
Beat you like producers, eat you like produce
Man, I'll fuck your girl 'til her pussy got no juice
Now, she can't produce, so you won't be needing that, baby
'Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
All right, let me vent for a minute. See, the problem I got with the game is: There are no gatekeepers in hip hop. Who's letting these wack niggas in? I mean, can someone please put a combination lock on the door? And stop giving out the code? Goddamn! Hey, Millz, show 'em how it's done!

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to Catholic school back in the day
Now, she stripping in Sue's for a stack a day
But she bring it all to Daddy, so that's okay
I got a bitch named Lola, true dick-smoker
Part-time broker; late nights, she work at Strokers
Her cousin named Mocha got a insane spine
But it's crazy 'cause I fucked 'em both at the same time
I even got a bitch in the Bay named Jessica
I swear, she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa got a attitude, but her ass meaner
She remind me of this ho I used to fuck named Sabrina
Ugly lil' thing from the home of the Ravens
I only kept her 'round 'cause the ass was amazing
Tiffany and Emily, my bona fide sluts
When I cum, they touch tongues and share that nut
Got a white chick down in Florida named Sasha
On my mama, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo, she let me fuck her on the washer
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now, I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take ten dicks before you meet the president
Young Money! (Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I know this one honey
I call her "Track Star" 'cause when we fuck, she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb-bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plummy and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, honey
I paper-chase, fuck standstill money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we riding if the fan belt running
Leave a motherfucker just laying there, bloody
I'm from the Dirty and I make it rain—damn, that's muddy!
She just wanna be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks, I go nutty-butty
What it dizz-oo? Is you or is you ain't my baby?
Baby?

[Intro]
Yeah
This is usually where I would talk but, I don't talk

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Okay, one for the money, two for the money
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?
Models on me, yes these girls crazy
Gotta take advantage, that is what the fans made me
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin' pillow?
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy
Haters mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me
Who'd have thought this rapping make sense, no 50?
And if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I used to be broke, no cash
And them niggas played games, Road Rash
Walking 'round NYU, looking for a dollar
Too proud to ask my friends or my struggling father
So I skate around the city for a couple hours
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours
Now I got some, but I want it all
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol
Cause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul
And I refuse to slow down until its last call
Erykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience
And treat women like money, no object
But these hoes are a much different story
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money
But money won't buy you time, If all the time is running from me
There's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook
And stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those
I haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm on it though
Yeah, I'm on it though

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh
If I could write one song to right all wrongs
I would, if I could
But in retrospect a little bad is good, mm-hmm
We all need what we want and don't want what we need, mm-hm
Life is bittersweet, bittersweet indeed, mm-hmm
Well I'm so human it is a goddamn shame... I'm your thing
And I make sure that I always keep me some pain- yessir
To remind me that I survived somehow- oh
Lord please don't let nothing steal me away right now- cause I wanna live!

Cuz I wanna hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Now hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Just live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Well I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Said stand up, everybody, uh this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters, the lovers who ain't here
You only got one life y'all and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going
Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
Cuz ignorance is bliss
And ignorance is just so fucking ignorant you may even be ignorant of this
If you say so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin still fuckin so fools dont make a dish
Light a candle for love blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish
Cuz I wanna Hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Now hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Just live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Well I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive
Well I have struggled so hard yet I survive
And a little miracle that I'm still alive

[Intro]
Its young Khalifa man
Paper Plane Gang
5-0-1 young
Ay, shout out to my brother Spitta, man

And your bitch could see this shit from across the street, nigga
It's pimpin' over here
Macaroni
Ta-Ha!
Kush and Orange Juice, nigga
What up Chevy
Jerm I see you
Cardo On The Beat

[Verse 1]
Uh, I don't love 'em
I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
Smoke somethin'
Go to a new state soon as I fuck 'em
Niggas be pressed for pussy
It ain't nothing
Instead of worrying about who that bitch fuckin'
Why don't you get you some money?
9 times out of 10, she see me stuntin'
Game running
Wanna know my hotel
And who phone to ring when she coming
I keep it a hundred
Get love from the hoes, but it's
Money over bitches
Nothing above it
Like the weed loud
Like my engine when I speed up
Bitches holding they weave
Rolling trees
With they pretty feets up
Them suckas often imitate
But they can't be us
So super high
Look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh
Cut my speakers up
Drowning out what the critics say, just
Continue to smoke and remain G as fuck
Polo socks match my Polo hat
She leave once, it's a known fact
That she ain't coming back
Now Taylor Gang that

[Hook]
And ain't shit change
But the amount of horses in my motor
When I switch lanes
And I beat 'em blinding
With them diamonds in my big chain
Heavy in the game, little homie
I'm doing big things
And them bitches, they mesmerized
They recognize
I keep it so G (I keep it so G)
Get you some money, fuckin' with me (fuckin' with me)

[Verse 2]
I don't love 'em
I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
Try to get paper
How the fucker don't know shit about her
I take you up where it's cloudy
Ain't one them lames still rockin' Prada
I go to Louie and blow a couple thousand
One of my baddest bitches
Rollin' up while I'm driving
And she don't even smoke
Just hit it once while she light it
My game tight, seal and sign it
Them niggas just playing
Ain't really ballin'
Saying they being honest
Claiming that's your wife
But we can't call it
She all in my hotel suite
At 3 in the morning
Taking her clothes off
Inhaling weed and coughing
Ain't her first time chiefing
But say she don't do this often
Since I was 16
I had all the intentions to keep it G
Take niggas hoes
And smoke hella trees with 'em
As for your team
You niggas in the stands, you just lookin'
I'm a pro to these rookies
And the plan is still paper over... pussy

[Hook]
And ain't shit change
But the amount of horses in my motor
When I switch lanes
And I beat 'em blinding
With them diamonds in my big chain
Heavy in the game, little homie
I'm doing big things
And them bitches they mesmerized
They recognize
I keep it so G (I keep it so G)
Get you some money, fuckin' with me (fuckin' with me)

[Outro]
Yeah nigga, this shit just don't sound cool
This what we go to sleep to, wake up to
Kush and Orange Juice nigga
Got your bitch cooking them cheese eggs too
Got paper in my pocket
Taylor Gang what's up?
See y'all niggas man
We done fucked over 'em this year, it's a wrap
Hahahaha, yeah
We don't want no more sucker shit, ever

[Intro: Rico Wade]
Man let me hit that
You gon' pass that?
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

[Verse 1: André 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm full as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Outro: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Sittin’ in a Ferrari, thinking ’bout money
I swear I will go head up with all of y’all, bumper cars
Bullshit fly by me, I’m ducking all the bad vibes
Shoot you nine times just in case you got cat lives
My punchlines give you black eyes
Like like, then kill yourself: 7 pounds
I’ve been to hell and back, and made it back fine
Black diamonds killin’ them, black-on-black crime
Now can I live and if I can, can I live it up
I’mma squeeze life, just enough to fill a cup
Well, shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Drink it all, I’m dead, so I throw some ice in it
And belch when I finish

(‘cuse me, ‘cuse me)

[Hook]
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, its the martian and I come for all
I swear I will go head up with all y’all, bumper cars
Nigga I’m a slumber dog, millionaire, been there
Smoke some kush and snap my fingers in case you got cat lives
Uh, so much for being settled down
Suicide flow, go and kill ya self, Seven Pounds
Blunt thick as Bobby Christina, high as Serena’s skirt
Only smoking that real grass, no arena turf
Now can I live and if I can, I rep that dirty south
And you haven’t seen cleaner dirt, you haven’t seen it worse
So shut the fuck up and steam the purp
Tell them haters “arrivederc”
Yeah I lost my mind, help me find it I will lead the search
Uhhh

[Hook]
I heard you got that good, ready for the take-off
Fire up that wood, let the jets blast off
To another World, right next to that white moon
Fly in the sky, tell em we’ll be back soon

[Hook]
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
‘fore we out here baby
We up out here baby

[J. Cole Verse 1]
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own

[Hook]

[J. Cole Verse 2]
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!

[Hook]

[End]

[Verse 1]
The world turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some who say life's a bitch
Well I’mma keep flirting
Fuck that bitch for the money and Louis V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
Niggas flexin’ hard with no bars, they got weak service
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin’ bitch then what you call that
Nothing but net, ain't back cause I never left
I did everything right nigga better yet
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us
Something like a contracto,r built it from the ground up
Now just, twist up this weed
Realize that you are in the presence of a G
Don’t fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean

[Hook]
I’m riding round, smoking, my music up loud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

[Verse 2]
See me, when I’m alone, wishing they could fuck with me
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me
But I’m just riding dawg, doing a buck fifty
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and jet skis
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretzky's
My dime pieces only recognize the best trees
Treat ‘em like I don’t need ‘em boy, you best believe
You in her face, I let her breathe
From debated on, to waited on
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on
Cause we are, young movie stars
Cause we are, young movie stars

[Hook]
I’m riding round, smoking, good music aloud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

[Bridge]
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)
(Ooooooh, oooh, ooo-oo-oooooh)

[Verse 3]
O-ooo-oh, now I just stunt on my own
Bitches ain't say shit to me
But now they won’t leave me alone
Used to walk the other way
But now they all come to my home
And they calling my phone, cause my paper is looong
Nothing, they ain't singing my song
Get hired up, if they want then I bring them along
We flying up, no you won't need a ticket at all
Need a ticket at all, tell a bitch I’ma ball
And I’ma buy a new crib for my niggas and all
Cause I remember days we’d sit and pictured it all
Nigga swear I’d leave or pictured I’d fall
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I’m a star
Cause we are, young, gifted
Not to mention out here making muthafuckin millions
Yeah, I said it, muthafuckin millions
Got my money up, I’m in the building

[Hook]
I’m riding round, smoking, good music aloud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Baby girl, I think we need to sit and talk, talk, talk
Playin' with my money, paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Blowin' up my heart then stick a pen and pop, pop, pop
Either you stupid or don't know what you got, got, got

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
I could be wrong, you could be right
You'll probably be alone, I'm probably not
Well listen, girl, you actin' like an idiot-ot-ot
Really tryna love you but it's gettin' hard, hard, hard

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playin'?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away

[Verse 2: Timbaland, Timbaland & Chris Brown]
Well I can take you back to the spot where you was bought, bought, bought
Make 'em return my paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock
Maybe you can think about the shit and stop, stop, stop
Climb up on this boat and show me how you drop, drop, drop

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland & Chris Brown]
I could be wrong, you could be right
You'll probably be alone, I'm probably not
Well listen, girl, you actin' like an idiot
Really tryna love you but it's gettin' hard, hard, hard

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Big Sean]
I-I-Is you crazy? Did you lose it?
A-A-Are you stupid? Are you foolish?
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playin'?
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
(B.I.G, boing, Sean Don, nigga)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay, woah there (Woah there), woah there (Woah there)
Is your noodle? Cock-a-doodle?
Are you crazy, crazy, crazy?
Did you knock a couple screws loose?
I-I-I know what time it is (Why?), only 'cause you cuckoo
I got bitches jumpin' for me like a bouquet by the beaucoup (Boing, boing, boing)
Are you tryna leave? Oh, you trippin', tie your shoe lace (You lil' bitch)
You's a dime bitch 'cause you two-faced (Two-faced)
And you gave me heads and tails (Hahaha)
Throw it at me, baby (Baby), I be the wishin' well (Yeah)
For real though, I know our shit's not perfect
We connected then need space, swear our love is written in cursive
Put that rock up on your finger (Finger), paper in your hands (Hands)
But you can't cut me out (Out), bitch, this ain't no game

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Big Sean]
I-I-Is you crazy? Did you lose it? (Boing, boing)
A-A-Are you stupid? Are you foolish? (You crazy)
Girl, I'm the only one like me on the planet
It don't take rocket science to understand it
You paper, scissors, rock my world, girl, am I the one you playin'? (Oh, oh)
You paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away
You throw it away, throw it away, th-th-throw it away, throw it away
Paper, scissors, rock my heart and throw it all away

[R. Kelly]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt

[Hook - R. Kelly]
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Cuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich
And I'm a flirt

[T.I. talking]
Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cuz another man will
Better eat eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz you leave ya wife and I see ya wife
Now be for real, how long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cuz you the business type
That's till I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang, sit that right
Up on that dress, see yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G cuz you might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, put my plan in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

[Verse 3 - T-Pain]
When I, when I, when I
When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, damn twenty-eights
Then I be like girl you know just who I am, don't hate
See I done fell in love with a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'mma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass Down
I be like como se llamo, lil' mama me llamo Pain
What is your name
I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same
I'mma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly, yes he's so cool
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad cuz I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad cuz I'm a flirt

[Hook - R. Kelly]

[Verse 4 - R. Kelly]
Oh, it's the remix
Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she lookin' at me then I'm gon' hit
Man jackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club
Acting like you in love
Stunting like you all thug
We was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by
You turn your head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling my daddy and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means
That means if you love your chick don't bring her to the V.I.P
Cuz I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga, it's a playa's field my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
Cuz I'mma flirt with her, right
He gon' flirt with her, right
And if she lickin' that good shit
She gon' flirt with her
I'm a flirt

On the V.I.P. tip, Maserati's in the lot
Chilling with the stars, where the bottles never stop
Got a model on my lap, baby show me what you got
With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy
Real talk, tha suites is next
One more drink gonna lead to sex
These girls is bad, the floor is packed
They shut the door down when it reach the max
Whatchu tryna drink? Clear or yak?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Boom shakalaka, here comes the chief rocka
Smoke good with T-Pain, and Snoop the weed doctor
Big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta'
Coke bottle shape, light green eyes
Drunk off of love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'mma smoke 'til I die
Just bust a bad one, for my homie D. Dimes
They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste Purple Rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G-thang
Lil' mama whip your hair, exhale the chronic
As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball
Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg
Boom!

[Intro]
Welcome, welcome
Yeah, yeah
Uh, uh
You'll never know

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Sly's been first, man
Y'all forever last I'm forever everlastin'
Mashing on the gas bypassing all the has-beens
In that sense I'm that shit in that scents
Inhale it, breathe it, embrace it
Crepes is not as flat as you natives of fake is
So I take this and shine and provide illumination
But niggas stay in the dark and I'm startin' to get impatient
15 is the age of the teenager
Roamin' with a mind full of gold, no pager
A circle of squares is what shaped us
Until it's sussed, feel free to hate us
Unchained, untamed, fast lanin', fat chainin'
Throw 'em on a playlist labeled as the greatest
Unleaded premium, large not medium
Say cheese, bitches bodies seize upon meeting us, man

[Verse 2: Gruzen]
This is what I do, I infect hope
And inspire folk by painting pictures with the better view
My soul is weatherproof, my mind can shapeshift
Divine greatness runs in bloodlines still ancient
Expansive universes embedded in ours
Reflected in stars, I shine with the breath in my heart
That's why my flows complete, it's flawed
Get raw energy, exposed for the whole globe to see
Yeah you know it's me, I'm back at it again
Elevating the bar, haters will never get in
This is a sacred place, where we embrace creation
Through landscape, shape and painted in a vacant space

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
They asked us to stop playing so rough outta courtesy
And if I were to stay in my lane, I swerve purposely
I spit fire, burns in the third degree
Every line is turpentine to these herb serpentines
Snakes in the grass, for all you dumbasses
Fairfax bastards, rockin' nerd glasses
I dominate, y'all denominate fractions
I relapse back to spittin' crack like chapped lips
Chasin' pavements 'til the day of amazin' payment
Success is the fragrance on my Bathin' Ape apron
Pull your face up out your anus and face this
Darth invade your playlist, you cannot evade this
Closed case, you're makeshift, I make hits
You make shit, you crave this, this greatness
You can't attain us like bad grades for Asians
I'm grade-A list, lick the speaker, you could taste it

[Intro: Flo Rida & Kesha]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It’s on and poppin tonight cause it’s meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
Cause we be ballin', it's platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl, you the truth with all of that goody power, 'cause

[Chrous: Flo Rida & Kesha]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida]
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found (It's going down, down)
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
(it's going down, down)

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey! Shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands
My Benjamin Frank-a-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur ('Cause)

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Kesha]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida]
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down, down

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Yeah! I'm spending my money (Hey)
I'm outta control (Hey)
Somebody help me
She's taking my bank roll
But I'm king of the club (Hey)
And I'm wearing the crown
Popping these bottles, touching these models
Watching they asses go
Down, down, down

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Kesha]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down, down (Hey)
You spin my head right round, right round (Hey)
When you go down, when you go down, down (Hey)
You spin my head right round, right round (Hey)
When you go down, when you go down, down

[Jae Millz]
Nigga. I'm from a city full of pity these niggas are silly
Kill you in Harlem hit the turnpike in lower Philly
And these little niggas ain't got books in their book bags
Your next neighborhood killer might be who you look past
Get it right before you get left
And sent to the upper room cause your ass couldn't calm down
Rewind me back and you notice I'm trying to warn you
Before your collarbone be what hollows are getting torn through
Play gangasta tonight and you won't see the morn' dew
And the whole next month would be something mother mourn through
God forgive me I know Thou shalt not kill
But id rather him than Millz so if I gotta I will

[Lil Wayne]
I'm from New Orlean where the water never clean
So ima gonna shower in some fuckin gasoline
You fuckin with the monster everyday is Halloween
My choppers ain't no doctors but they taking out your spleen
No my riders ain't no robbers but they taking everything
From Mamas to baby Mamas to Papas and we goin to pop up with poppers and leg warmers, barrel way down my jeans
My nigga ain't no fire but I'm a blaze everything
I'm that hollygrove roster and my number 17
Eastside bitch, thats where I come up as a teen
But now I'm the man, and now I'm the man
And this is my land Lilweezyana and New Orleans In the City

[Short Dawg]
H-Town sunnyside this my playground
Home of ... candy paint 808 sound
Styrofoam here it is If you make my syrup spill
Ima put my hands on you like a steering wheel
And we dont feel to kill cause this the pace to cop the work
The cop's a jerk got it so hot its comin out my shirt
You get your mama merked, You know the Glocks will squirt
Cause niggas going out the shrooms and those hoes will pop the purse
Houston Texas who harder than us
With a hundred thousand flipped dope boys get a rush
Hunch of codine and we pour it in the cup, now everybody slower than the short yellow bus
Now everybody know that the boy is the truth
Stay down I team next door to the booth
Ill tell you 16th east exits side street right past is where we roll is where you find me

[Intro]
Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound
I stunt hard, I make it work, yeah
I make it work, yeah, I make it work, who
I live large, I make it work, yeah
I make it work, yeah

[Verse 1]
Childish Gambino, lame niggas never heard of it
Sick Boi is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick
When these mothafuckas gonna understand I’m serious?
I’m hard in the paint like I fuck her on her period
James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt
Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin’ like a greaser
Word is born, baby my dictionary’s in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum man
Why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won’t be on the freshmen list, guess I’ll just keep spittin’ shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin’ they would see me just for me, dope rhymer
They do me like my first house, no co-signer
See you usin’ qualifiers, you don’t even know
“I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show”
Even though, I was rappin’ back when Lance had chemo, ho
Even flow, Pearl Jammin’ niggas can’t leave me alone
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low
Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow

[Hook]
Runnin’ through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher

[Verse 2]
Gambeezy make it work somethin’, let me check the syntax
Don’t add an eezy to my name, ’cause it has never been that
Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from street rat
Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags
Steady movin’, don’t worry about where I’mma be
Cause I’mma be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie
Honesty, I’m rappin’ ’bout everything I go through
Everything I’m sayin’, I’m super sayin’ like Goku
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact, I swear the track I lie on’s my last track

[Hook]
Running through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher
Running through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher

[Verse 1]
Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud? Let me back track
I know my game ain’t that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can’t have
So I don’t text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn’t last year
Oh, you like me now? Well that’s weird
Last year you were chillin’ with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you, ma, Raichu
Fuck your life
I don’t really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame ass dudes gon’ suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin’ to me
“Nah, baby, you way too hood for me”
Y’all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I’m on the edge, they hoping that I might fall
I make it work, I’m running with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain’t used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an ’06, I’m an ’02
But enough about high school
I’m getting laid, or I’m getting lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say something dumb to give us something to fight about?
Never mind, lights out

[Chorus]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me

[Verse 2]
Swag
2:30 and we still making progress
Talking on Twitter, see where to go next
3:30, man, where did the time go?
I’m chilling with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I must've left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doing stupid shit, have stories when I’m older
But I don’t wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I’m chillin’ out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That’s why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking ’bout the girls in my songs
If you don’t like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, ’cause he bunk
She like, “I’m not a slut”—speed bump
By the way, what’s your name? ‘Cause we drunk

[Chorus]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it (yeah, we drunk)
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose (we drunk)
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing (I’m drunk)
Show me what you do to me, me
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me

[Bridge]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
(I got to get high)
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
(I need to get high)
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
(I got to get high)
Show me what you do to me, me
(I got to get high)

[Outro]
I gots to get high
I need to get high
Uh, I needs to get high
Uh, I gots to get high

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
It seems like they all want me to fail
But I’m not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don’t want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back
Not going back

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I could've been a tragedy
That’s why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
‘Cause they ain’t have the smarts or the heart
Ain’t you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith, that’s Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I’m rapping, that’s hating
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y’all saying?
Step inside the party, y’all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple: Live easy and Bruce Willis
I’m the boss, Michael Scott, y’all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y’all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That’s why these fucking emcees want their asses back
Don’t you know that I’m a rapist? Ask a track
Whiskey sipping, wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fucking hate me, that’s what I’m used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
God damn, man, there’s gotta be a better way
Than pill-popping all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I’m Jessie in this bitch, I’m so excited
There’s a party at the top, you ain’t invited
But it’s lame, and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up’s a mistake
Black dudes assume I’m closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
It seems like they all want me to fail
But I’m not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don’t want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back
Not going back

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Dirty girls love my dick; they’re cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it’s not kosher
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothing against the sisters, I just don’t think they’re into me
I am not a thug, AKA: what they pretend to be
I am just myself, AKA: my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fucking knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It’s cool though, it’s all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I’m sorry, babe, but I act me
I don’t "act black," whatever that be
I’m just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they're looking for some In-N-Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread—making sandwiches
That’s why you niggas fail like all of your parents’ marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we’re better off, you’re welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that?
Like that bullshit, you talked before Culdesac
"I didn’t know he had it in him"
Couldn’t see me as Spider-Man, but now I’m spittin’ venom
Now you payin’ attention, pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero, I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because

[Outro: Beldina Malaika, Childish Gambino]
Fake love, these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you’re ready to be (be)
But it isn’t with me (me)
So I’m ready to leave you alone
I don’t really wanna fight like this
I don’t ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold onto
I just wanna be your girl
Everything you haven’t heard
Plus, I just wanna be with you
(With you) With you
(With you) With you
(With you) I just wanna be with you
(With you) With you
(With you) With you, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve

[Verse 1]
Not a minute more
Not a second more
Not infinite though
Watchu waitin for?
Never nah, no, say
Takin off time
Takin off day
Whatchu fightin for?
When yo booty flow
Who that known it though
Whatchu waitin for?
If you runnin from love
You love her like that
You runnin' from nuns
She running right back
Because it's

[Chorus]
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve

[Verse 2]
And I'm on a road
And I'm backin? No
To love you no more
To look back and forth
Till you got it from the
You got it what what
Baba ba ba baa
One a 44
Till I'm on the road
Till you (?) know
I know we would know
Till a (?)
I'm backin' on up
I'm makin mine
Till I cannot stop in the night

[Bridge]
Oh oh yeah
Oh yeah
Throw your hands up
Uh, (?) throw your hands up
And keep em up now
And keep em up high
No no no
Baby no
And we ain't goin' down baby
Oh no no
No, we ain't goin' down
You gotta keep em up high, high
And we ain't going down baby

[Verse 3]
Walla boom mena
I've been on that money
Days of the (?)
Money done side
Paper lined up all fallin'
And they linin club poppin'
And they down to throw
I'm just zonin'
Eh... nah
Actin' like purple salt
I've been on that rhyme till I get it now
Puffin up
Making money
Grindin paper
Make it witch you
Hey yo, Enuff, man! What you got to drink up in here, man? I'm thirsty

Big slam, quick slam, tin can, whatever
Whether too cold or too hot, you got to keep Pepsi in the freezer
I keep a 3 liter for my crew
My girl like them diet joints too
For when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait
Other sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse
If it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?
What you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth
Hot like the south, flash out ya 12 ounce and renounce
Nothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i
Yes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case, tastes great, less filling
Non-alcoholic I can feed it to my children
Tell em Biggie said, "Drink it all"; don't test me!
Nothing else beats a Pepsi, if it is, let's see..I'm thirsty

[Verse 1]
Babe, just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this by myself? Hey yeah
With rose colored lenses on my store bought frames
To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you ain't feeling the same

[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don’t need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful
You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah
Please forgive me for feeling like it’s all your fault
A heavy heart can’t carry blame for the loss

[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

[Verse 3]
You might not know this but I’m a man with pride
And this hurts me baby deep down, deep down
I can’t let go of this, gotta know I tried
It’s pathetic baby don’t lie, don’t lie
I’m a candle, you’re the sun
And you’re burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah

[Outro]
Pyrite from 24 karat yeah
Cubic’s from genuine diamond yeah
A call from the woman who loves you
And hello from a friend
We'll never be more than friends
We'll never be..

[Intro]
Yeah (Hahaha)
Hey

[Verse 1]
Louis frames hide my bloodshot eyes
My disguise, from this world outside
Vivid description paints a picture for the blind
Got me on my syrup sippin' shit, slowin' down time
I'm hidden from the shine
Trippy shit, she listen and then rewind
Put the black light on, close the blinds
Walkin' on the clouds, turnin' water into wine
As I travel through ya mind
Now you swimmin' through ya thoughts
Creep outside the lines, those who live within the box
Gone, seein' spots like chickenpox
So gone, Michael Jordan start missin' shots
Acid, tablets, down the hole with Alice
Smilin' like the cat is, water from a cactus
Snapback fallin' off my head, mad hat shit
Got the earth spinnin' off its axis
Feelin' like the shit, no diaper
Sippin' apple cider, goin' back and forth like a windshield wiper
This gon' be another all-nighter
'Cause I'm trippin' out, yeah, I'm trippin' out

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Got a bottle of water, couple tablets, and a half a zip
Pack your bags, we goin' on a acid trip
Don't mean to scare you, just get inside the car
The driver sayin', "Where to?", to the top, please
Hidden from the news and paparazzi
It wake you up like coffee, yeah
Now, I'm layin in my strawberry fields
Appeal to my senses and it seem so real
A figment of imagination, uh
And I've heard your prior allegations
And it's true, bitch, I'm higher than you
Maybe goin' schizo, open up the window
Trippy like the music on Nintendo
It's all good, bro, roll some endo
Lost you at the twenty, but I'll see you in the end-zone
I'm trippin' out
Man I got my dark glasses on, cause I'm ready for the big lights
All my money counted, all my rubbers skintight
Me, I always fit out, you was more the in type
I never follow suit, you was more like pinstripes
Riding in Ye's Maybach, smoking so it's cloudy
With three girls who spent all day doing Pilates
Getting money, niggas think I joined illuminati
Throwing west side up, I'm feeling like Killuminati
Now isn't it ironic that I'm in a big body
Paranoid cause every rapper named Big got bodied, boy
And my bitch got body
But I sit her in the back, cause my nigga called shotty!
And I'mma G-O till I'm a OG
Rocking something high end, like a fucking OD
They feel a nigga from NY to the OC
If we down in the 4th quarter, I take it to OT
Take it to 1 and 0, just take it it's on me
Chilling in the hot spot cause I never get cold feet
Nigga, you on the sidelines praying for an audible
Cause when you're legendary everything is quotable
Priceless is affordable, order what you can't afford
Matter fact, order more
And I think I'mma have the same thing
My whole team getting cash, I just call it gangrene
Big is on the track, Ye be on the track
Since when Kobe and LeBron hoop for the same team
Could live my life blindfold
Cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah, I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with GOOD, and been living a changed scene
I'm trying to turn these gray clouds to Vanilla Skies
Camera in my face, I guess the future will be televised
And I'm as underrated as can be, bitch
Fuck it if I'm underrated, I stay on some G shit
Nigga, I chief up, it's December 25
Three hundred and sixty-five, forever puttin' reef up
And your girlfriend forever want to meet her
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us
Man I break her heart every time I change hoes
I make a new style every time I change clothes
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows
One of the few getting change but won't change for it

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I don't think that I ever changed, ball hard or spark spliffs
And when I'm in the booth, it's super like Clark Kent
Competition fails to ever place an event
So when I step up to the track, you consider my shit a win
Never gonna stop, Genesis is the begin
All about the money, I'm changin' my name to Yen
Swagger so tall, check Yao up in the chin
Stay reachin' for the sky like a nigga can't swim
But I'm on my two and my pivot lookin great
Tell Z to have 'em rolled when I touch down in the state
Tell them we eatin' well and we never scrapin' plates
Stealin' bitches from they niggas just becuase I like the chase
Odd Future wolves, full moon, salivate
Look I done made it, the same nigga that you hate
Salutin' the game, pilots all up in the place
Fly niggas do it all, y'all grounded like bad grades
Never said thug, but my niggas will pop
And if it's Louie V or Gucci then my niggas will cop
Wait for the summer, Rolling Papers will drop
And hatin' and speculatin' is the shit that will stop
I'mma go hard, or I'mma do nothin'
Like a beeper in a toilet, bet my shit buzzin'
Hell yeah I'm the shit, just take a whiff, cousin
Now you all frowned up, thought I told you I been stuntin'
I get my highs and lows like NASDAQ
Spit up addiction and bag that, pass crack
Livin' the life, you lames remain wack
If I ain't gettin' laid, I'm gettin' high and watchin' Flapjack and that's that

[Intro]
Better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)
Nigga, get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (Motivation)
Haters better get on yo job, tell'em, haters get on yo job, nigga (It's motivation)
Sucka nigga, get on yo job, if ya, hatin' get on yo job, nigga

[Verse 1]
You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever
Anythang don't kill me, make me better
I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda
And the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't fo-ever
I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer
I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla
Even if I'mma all alone or standin' with four niggas
Tell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer
5'9" with the soul of a 6'4" nigga
I separated the fakes, paralized from the waist down
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town
Can't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down
I'm outta jail nigga, whachu gotta say now?

[Hook]
Motivation
Niggas fakin' only gonna inspire (Motivation)
All yo hatin' in fuel to my fire (It's motivation)
Niggas plottin' on the crown salt droppin' (It's motivation)
Hey but I ain't slowin' down and I ain't stoppin' (Motivation)
Now nigga don't stop my show (Motivation)
You ain't know I don't stop, I grow (It's motivation)
Sucka niggas can't make me suffer
Just make me stronger and make me tougher (It's motivation)

[Verse 2]
To be locked in a box niggas happy to see
Put anybody on top, any rapper but T-
I-P, but back to reality, G-O-D still carrying me, nigga I run this
Spread yo rumours, kick all yo lil' dumb shit
Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon get
If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with
Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with
Small thang to a giant, I can overcome this
Jail, I don' done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with
I could be a local joker, never have one hit
Nigga, "New Finish" alone'll get me dumb rich
While these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies
If Grand Hustle sell any, I'mma get plenty
If God with me, who could be against me sucka?
Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Jets nigga now where haven't we
They look up to jets nigga now where haven't we
Fuck boys wondering if the bitch next]
Ask yourself
How fly
The planes and the Taylor Gang

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Haters stand clear of em
Y'all stand cheer for em
Shook away from lames and over came let's hear it for em
Zig zag smoke, magic lyrics appear to em
Outta nowhere air hare Jordans
Kicked up sitting behind a mahogany desk
Crumbling 'erb just as Big Boi and Andre would suggest
Flow sick need a check up
Flow sick that's how I got my checks up
Bad bitches gold digging lame niggas
Out a trip to foreign places or bracelet or necklace
Then slide through the set and fuck the JETS cause she respect us
You think you got a winner but you don't I bet she let us
Pickles, tomatos, onions, mayo, mustard, and ketchup, the works
Driving in a Aquifina truck to the club
Cause Wiz told me that these bitches was thirst
Crash test dummy honey need a helmet cause she jumping head first
It's amazing how I get so high and stay so down to Earth

[Refrain]
Ain't nah niggas iller, explosive and fly, surface to air missile
Old sucka-ass nigga go somewhere and fuck yourself
Cause ain't nobody fucking with us
You didn't put a hundred on it then you can't hit it
Me and my nigga Wiz will smoke an ounce in one sitting
Yea it's the Planes and the Taylor Gang
Lame niggas putting locks and chains on they bitches

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoke filled rooms
Camera lens zooms from a mile away you can smell the fumes
College girls play me in their iPod or Zune
Even bitches with bad attitudes bumping to our tunes
They high maintenance
Give em wings let em fly places
Introduce you to high times, flavors, and sky scrapers
Rolling in lime papers and Randy's
Smoking out somewhere where the sand be
Plan B killing these kids
Not Michael Jackson
I ain't feeling these kids
And you hating such a shame that's where your energy is
I'm in a Gfizz flying
Leave your bitches with the planes now she sky diving
Hella vibing
And your hating adds just more steam
More chips now I'm living more Rothstein
So for every thing it's worth
I travel all four corners of the Earth putting in work

[Refrain]
Ain't nah niggas iller, explosive and fly, surface to air missile
Old sucka-ass nigga go somewhere and fuck yourself
Cause ain't nobody fucking with us
You didn't put a hundred on it then you can't hit it
Me and my nigga Wiz will smoke an ounce in one sitting
Yea it's the Planes and the Taylor Gang
Lame niggas putting locks and chains on they bitches
Overripe, fresh-skeezed, California females
With 3-inch, cherry red, press-on Lee nails
Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking
Like a garbage bag full, overflowing (please) now it's leaking
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair
So I can climb up and get into your underwear
You rat soup eating, test cheating, no business punk
You're insecure, born in the junkyard with the junk
You've gone wet-look crazy and messed with your head
You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
You're all mixed up, like pasta primavera
Yo, why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera, man?
Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor
So get that money out of your ass, you whore
Well, I brought her upstairs onto the roof
I dogged your wife, and she is a doofus

So what goes around comes around
And what goes around comes around
What goes around comes around
And what comes around goes around (goes around)
Chosen bound
Fully down
Feeling down
Yo, Holmes, your nose is brown
Clean B, cleaning the G spot, you know that we've got
The Dolemite's house, and you have not
Look out my window, look over the city
With two black eyes, your girl ain't that pretty
Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat?
Why you wanna treat your girl like that?
Living in the rat race, smoking rat weed
Well, you reap what you sow when you plant the seed
Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Got more Louie than Phillip Rizzuto

What goes around comes around
And what goes around comes around
What goes around comes around
And what comes around goes around
What goes around comes around
And what goes around inevitability
Comes around, what?
And what goes around comes around
What goes around, you know, it comes around
What?
Check it, check it, check it

What?
What, what

[Intro: Afroman]

Man, my daddy told me
Boy, when I was your age
I had to walk 13 miles to school
I said, "Oh, is that why you didn't graduate?"

[Hook: Afroman]

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Fit to go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know I'm fit to act a fool, yeah

[Verse 2: Afroman]

Mama, I'mma
Go to the University of Smoking Marijuana
All of my friends go to USC
So I'm gonna tag along and hit the bong with them
Walkin' through the masses, lookin' for my classes
I can't concentrate on the teacher, surrounded by titties and asses
Spent a lot of money on some brand new clothes
Trying to impress these brand new hoes
Laugh every time I have sex with a chick
Baby don't know I'm an ex-convict
Walking round the campus with my 'fro on thick
Every twenty seconds I be grabbin' my dick
Full of alcohol at the football games
Doin' more drugs than my nigga Rick James
My GPA is dropping at a very fast rate
It'll take a miracle for me to graduate
Maybe I won't, maybe I will
Stressed out, poppin' pills in my Coupe Deville

[Hook x1]

[Verse 2: Afroman]

How do I party?
And still pass
I hardly
Ever go to class
Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal
If you bought it from me, it's illegal
Cause I'm Afroman, the educated Crip
On a rock cocaine scholarship
Cook that crack until it's done
I use that for my Negro college fund

Broke minorities, selling dope to those bitches in sororities
She's drinking one too many 40's
She took her clothes off, now we're having orgies
Baby, I don't mean to act rude
But you told me you would never fuck a black dude
Colt 45 must have got you in the mood
To eat a fat dick like some soul food

[Hook x1]

[Verse 3: Afroman]
(Hey fellas, can I get jiggy with it? Hey, check this shit out right here)

Hey homeboy, don't stress, I got the answers to the test
My college professor smokes a lot of grass
She's gonna make sure we pass
That's how you pass trigonometry
Sell dope to your teacher, use nigga-nometry
On the microphone, there's not a rapper bomb as me
And under police pressure, nobody's as calm as me
Wait a minute, you know what's fucked up
Black people in college act stuck up
So self-conscious, and insecure
You wanna speak black, but you really ain't sure
Look at me, what do you see?
You see the OG, you ashamed to be
So fuck you, you pretty little rich frat boy
You can suck my dick just like that boy

[Hook x1]

[Verse 4: Afroman]

I said, "Honey
You got some sexy looks
You need money
To buy your textbooks"
Get it wet, and I can get it hard
We can slide your vaginal credit card
Computer girl, come to my house and be my tutor girl
Before we study, can we smoke a little Buddha, girl?
Raise your shirt, lick the nipples on your hooters, girl
Open up your legs, baby you the girl
Stick out your tongue and let me shoot it, girl
You was playing with my floppy, then my hard drive downloaded
Down your throat, and fucking exploded
Tell your prejudice dad and mom
To email their comments to suck-my-dick.com
Afro's the bomb, blowing up like Vietnam

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong
But the strength I have is washin' away
It won't be long
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

[Chorus]
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know
Mistakes were made between us two
And we showed our ass that night
Even said some things weren't true
Watched you go
And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover, friend

[Chorus]
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

[Bridge]
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching every day that goes by (I miss you much)
'Til I get you back I'm gon' try (Yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (Girl, I miss you much, I miss you much)
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching every day that goes by (I miss you much)
'Til I get you back I'm gon' try (Yes, I miss you much)
'Cause you are the apple of my eye (Girl, I miss you much, I miss you much)

[Chorus]
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

[Bridge]
I want you to fly with me (Want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (Miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (Wish you could dine with me)
The one that'll grind with me (Said the one that will grind with me)
I want you to fly with me (Want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (Oh, miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (Wish you could dine)
The one that'll grind with me (Oh, one that'll grind, ay-ay)

[Chorus]
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na (Make up, woah-oh)
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na (Link up, link up, ay)
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na (Link up)
Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, "wetter than jacuzzi bitches"

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

[Verse 2]
Half a bar,  just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch
Baddest, the baddest
My pussy's the fattest
I'm bad
Bad
Bad, Bad

[Intro]
Yeah, whoa

[Verse 1]
Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

[Verse 2]
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

[Bridge]
Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh

[Outro]
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Fire bomb

[Hook: Amber Petty]
Starlight
Where did you go?
I've been running around the world
Gotta let you know

[Verse 1: DC Pierson]
I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear ya'll converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's cuz I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard
They call me Violet Beauregard, cuz I just blow up, no regard
All I really need is a bar to belly up to
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to
So what are you up to? This weekend I'm free
Till then I'll just shine and let you find me

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I shine like the sun
My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun
This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue
My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country
I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line
I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli
I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby
The wait is over, no baking soda
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders
I saw them dudes move flats and corners
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover
I got that green like a four leaf clover
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters
Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire
And get the shit straight, turn back, retire
Cuz one in a mil turn snow to fire
You either move weight, play ball or neither
Because I'm neither, the hood Macgyver
The boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda
My life so sweet that my balls Godiva
The world in front and the hood behind us
The hood behind us
Yea
The hood behind us

[Intro: Lil Wayne, Fee Banks, & DJ tags]
Ayy— Ayy, Fee
I saw this girl the other day. She gave me her number, right? You think I should call her?
You better, nigga
I think I should call her
You better, nigga
You think I should call her?
You better, nigga
Tch— I should call her
When I call her, I’ma be like— I’ma be like, “Ayy—“
Should I be like, “Darling—“
Or should I call her “beautiful,” or— (Gangsta— Gangsta—)
Something nice, you know?
That’s sweet
That sweet shit?
Should I just be like, “Bitch!” Like— (Gangsta— Gangsta—)
How ‘bout “Miss?” “Miss!”
“Miss!” Okay— (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ms. Butter Pecan, caramel, Southern belle
She hotter than a summer day in Hell
I'm under her spell; she say her name was Chantel
She say she got a man—I can't tell
Because when we be rockin', we get it poppin like a Amstel
Like, right up in the hotel—maybe the stairwell
She blows kisses to my handheld
She's an angel—her name should be "Angel"
I'm blessed, I kill her with the rich man smell
She got a wet manhole, and your mans fell, whoa!
I slipped in her inkwell
I saw jellyfish and seashells—no further details
I love the smell of a female
And you're one hell of a female
I'm tellin' you, female: Get in the CL
And let it be sweet sailin' and late night emailin'
Ooh! She feel me
Ooh, Fee! Fee! I think she feel me—oww!

[Break: Lil Wayne & DJ tags]
Yeah, she feel me (Ooh, oh)
Fee! I think— I think she feelin’ me, man
E-I, I think she diggin’ me, man (I think she feelin’ me, man, ha)
I told you, I told you (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I called her on a late night
It was late, right; I was on her ass like some brake lights
But I ain't stop for the red lights
We get it poppin' 'til the blue and red lights come knockin'
Neighbors keep trippin', we keep fuckin'
Sex revolution; baby, I'm comin'—
Down the hallway that lead to your stomach, mami
I'ma keep pumpin' 'til you scream, "Young Money!"
And me and your boyfriend is not the same
I go's down like the stock exchange, and then, I bring it up!
'Scuse me, I drink it up
I leave you soakin' wet from your ankle up—shucks!
I'm too much!
Fee! I'm too much!

[Outro: Lil Wayne & DJ tags]
Yeah! Yeah, haha! I’m too much! (Alright)
Baby girl, you could call me a slut, ha!
Yeah, you could call me a slut, baby (Hey)
I be your slut, baby (Girl)
Yeah, I'm too much!
Young Money, motherfucker!
We about to rule the world! (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Well, if not, we about to rule the girls! Alright

[Intro: Will Smith & Coko]
Whoo
Here come the Men in Black
It's the MiBs, uhh, here come the MiBs
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: MiB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
'Cause you never quite know where the MiBs is at
Uh and

[Chorus: Coko]
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
Galaxy defenders (Oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember (Won't let you remember)

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Uh uh, uh uh, now
From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like "boom" black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MiBs, freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?) Men in Black

[Bridge: Will Smith & Coko]
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (Bounce with me)
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me (Slide, slide, slide, slide)
Just slide with me c'mon
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me (Walk with me)
Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze (Uh huh huh ha)

[Chorus: Coko]
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
Galaxy defenders (Oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember (No, no)

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin'
I know we might seem imposin'
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in

[Chorus: Coko]
Here come the Men in Black (Here they come)
Galaxy defenders (Galaxy defenders)
Here come the Men in Black (Oh, here they come)
They won't let you remember (Won't let you remember)
Here come the Men in Black (Ohh, here they come)
Galaxy defenders (Oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black
They won't let you remember
Where to begin when love ends on a bad note
Or being honest make the trust grow
Apparently it make you argue more
The more things you throw
DVD’s and my dirty clothes
Telling me shutup, I’m leaving you
The reason you ain’t even got one
It wasn’t true
Look at her, now look at you
I know we ain’t perfect
But I made our world utopia
How could you not notice?
In denial cause you’re used to losing
Put me through it, ain’t the answer to it
Put on my Vans, take a walk to cool it
But you was always a test and I’m a student
Trying my best
But I never get the right solutions
I swear it’s one thing after another one
Fuck it I’m done
Am I done?
Mother say I’m too young
But what that mean?
I took a chance and now I’m playing
The game of love
Now it’s never ending
Forever chasing
That first feeling
On a quest for a woman's treasure
They keep it hidden
I gotta find love even if it kill me. (I gotta find love even if it kill me)
Can run into it anyday
But knowing me I prolly never meet
Only speak when a fan speak
Never chatting with a stranger
But there’s something about this girl that got me thinkin’. (Damn)
I-Phone accidentally called her
Says hello?
Silent moment
Man, I been missing you
And I know you miss me too
She sighed then she said
Thought we’d be together ’till the end
And this the end
So good luck with your career
Cause we can no longer be friends
Anymore. (Damn)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas
I swear I got on Saks Fifth boxers right now
I'm tryna milk the game as if the game was a cow
I had an Eddie Bauer Expedition seven years ago
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before
I used to wear braids like Jason's Lyric, whoa
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race

[Hook]
Cause I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog (Yessir)
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog, you know that

[Verse 2]
Look, never entertain the suckers with the hating bid'ness
(Nah, we never did that) I'm on a yacht playing table tennis
Expensive linin, women sinning
Adultery, compulsively
I'm an arsonist on the beat, blaze fire
The door close to the booth, I feel like a caged lion
Yeah let me loose, now let me get 'em
Cause I ain't going back and fourth like badminton
No, I will never drop the ball like bad mitten
And I ain't being conceited, I'm just admitting
I flow cocky, got hand rhythm
I got this bitch on lock like San Quentin
I'm tough daddy, what's popping gangster?
I'm tryna keep my pockets fat like opera singers
So sharp, if you touch me, I'll chop your fingers
I'm on top of the game like helicopter angles
I see you niggas, I hope you having fun
I hope you have a gun, heh, this shit is crazy
It's little Baby, I'm here to take it
And it's looking vacant

[Hook]
Cause I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog, you know that
I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog, you know that

[Verse 3]
Okay, now I'ma go off on 'em, at first I was going soft on 'em
But now it's time to go hard, busting, banging Bogard
Take a shit in yo' yard, take a piss on yo' broad
Make a list of yo' boys, and go and murder them all, huh
Life is short, yeah a midget told me that
And I always thought I was fly like I had a pigeon on my back
But I got decisions on my back, vision on my back
So don't you try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat
I don't rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, all I got to do is tat
Bet I hit my target, like a fucking dart mat
My address is Cloud 9, seek and you shall find
Weezy on the grind, I'm 'bout my Frankenstein
You know me, yeah, from my Lincolns to my Franklins
See I make that money stretch and connect like an anklet
Keep the bitches running in and out my house like a banquet
And I don't even speak their language, haha
And if the bitch boyfriend get angry
Then my niggas turn around and tell his whole clique
"Fuck that nigga! Pussy ass nigga!
Fuck that nigga!" Yeah

[Hook]
Cause I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog, you know that
I'm a beast, I'm a dog
Bitch I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog
Yeah you know that I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'm a beast, ho I'm a dog, you know that

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Oh, wine cooler

[Verse 1]
Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
He's even more over than my mayor, Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money
Sleepin' in the street, there ain't a damn thing funny
With the hand-me-down food, and the hand-me-down clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
Sometimes drunk, and he's always phoneless
Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks (Well)

[Chorus]
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
Kickin' uptown, kickin' downtown, kickin' crosstown
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall

[Verse 2]
He drinks where he lies, he's covered with flies
He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes
Well, you go upstate, and you get your head together
Thunderbird is the word, and you're light as a feather
Detox at the flop house, no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from (in Tennessee)
He lives in the street, but he's no bum
He's a rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
He got a platinum voice, but only gold records
On the bass was Boots and on the drums was Checkers
Louis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar
Johnny Ryall, who do you think you are?

[Chorus]
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
Drinkin' Night Train, drinkin' O.E
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, three...

[Verse 3]
Donald Trump and Donald Tramp living in the men's Shelter
Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing "Helter Skelter"
He asks for a dollar, you know what it's for
Man, bottle after bottle, he always needs more
He's no less important than you working class stiffs
He drinks a lot of liquor, but he don't drink piss
He paid his dues playing the blues
He claims that he wrote the "Blue Suede Shoes"
Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army
That's right, y'all, his name is Johnny, kick it!

[Chorus]
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
Johnny Ryall, Johnny Rya-
Check the cool wax!

[Intro: Rosario Dawson]
(*Laughter*)
What's wrong? What are you afraid of?
The Love Below?

[Verse 1: André 3000]
She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
Ah, but she lives in my lap

[Chorus: André 3000]
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Make me want you, make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl, remind me just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

[Bridge: Rosario Dawson & André 3000]
Baby, why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them, I care about you
Baby, I love you
You've got me open wide (I love you)
Just come inside (baby)
It's yours (it's yours), I'm yours (I'm yours)
For sure (for sure), play, baby, play

[Chorus: André 3000]
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)

[Sampled Outro: André 3000 & Rosario Dawson]
("I had a woman down...")
("On my lap at all times")
("I had a woman down...")
("On my lap at all...") (The Love Below)
("I had a woman down...")
She lives in my lap
("On my lap at all times")
("Now I'm realizing that I love her")
("On my lap at all times")
You've got me open wide
Oh, she lives in my lap
It's yours, I'm yours
Play, baby, play
("I had a woman down with me")
("On my lap at all times")
("Now I'm realizing that I love her")
("On my lap at all times")
("Now I'm realizing that I love her")
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
Baby, I love you!
Forever my fiancée
She lives in my lap
Play, baby, play

[Verse 1: Wiz khalifa]
Rapping ass nigga
There go Wiz, he a rapping ass nigga
I'm in a benz getting brain from a centerpiece
Before you can mention my name I need ten at least
I know they hate cause of the paper that a nigga see
Light a J and say a prayer for my enemies
Yea, made men bunch of made ass niggas
When you paid then you with some paid ass niggas
I heard that money grow on trees so I grew one
Left my old bitch at home got a new one
Said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it
I said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it
Your bitch leaving with us nigga that's tragic
The roof go in the trunk, that's magic
She rolling weed and she don't even smoke
Come to your job and make it flood bet you gone need a boat

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]

Hanging with the taylors drinking gin and im dancing

Any chick and all of her friends you know I'm tossing
Money spent (you know it), little money folded (you know it)
You got one crib (you know it), Juicy got 4 (you know it)
Only clubs that I like gotta have poles (you know it)
Only fuck with model chick, but I play with hoes (you know it)
My mansion sitting on forty acres
Who the neighbors? (whoo)
Kobe bryant from the lakers...now thats paper (lets get it)
And I still mob through the hood I dont need no waviers (yes sir)
Cause if you niggas getting wrong, I'mma see you later (bloaw!)

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Baby, you understand me now
If, sometimes, you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, what’s understood ain’t got to be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Heh, stood in the heat, the flame
The snow, "Please, slow down, hurricane"
The wind blow, my dreads swang
"He had hair like wool, like Wayne"
Huh, dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out, and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy
All real, very extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, or whenever, and the F for...
"Fucking fantastic"—fuck if you agree
I'm bright, but I don't give a fuck if you see me

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What's understood ain't got to be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months, I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money, baby—keep the change
My mama say, "Fuck 'em!" And we the same
So hello, motherfucker, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday?
You know; church fit, then out-fit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'? If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]

I'm watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout Black guys. Talking about how young Black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.

You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.

See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only... I don't want to say only right, but, shit... only logic by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found—you know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; Level 3, Level 4 drugs, shit like that.

Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood, huh? Yeah.

You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared. I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the Level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track. That's the good weed.

You know what? I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him? Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender. Hahaha. Then give me a paper. Haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.

Another thing. Let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh... Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.

Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, "'spec before check," anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.

Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um...

Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you: You don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!

But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him.

Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
But oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Chain chain hangin on my chest chest

Went from not having to having it
From dreaming to grabing it
With only top ramen noodles up in my cabinet
Now I'm killing this motherfucker, beating and stabbing it
Speaking of stabbing it where ya bitch she just text me
She say she in the room rockin something sexy
No disrespect g cause I ain't even trying to but send her to my room if you see her before I do

[Chorus: Big Sean]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Bitch I'm on a money making marathon

Journey of my life, The whole world is my carry on

Always heard that lifes a beach so I'm forever getting laid
If money equals power then I'm a fucken generator
Man that spotlight bright
So watch me center stage it and do it, yo girl wanna do it
Damn I look good, but you already knew it
Can't remember the last time I seen my bed sets
Or the last time I had bed sex
I'm in the backseat, getting my dick wet
I fell asleep getting brain, that's a head rest
Last night I hit the bar said I want it all
And today I said the same thing at the mall
Come through in yo city do the same thing tomorrow
Gettin money and I can't say the samething for ya'll

Uh yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

[Hook]

I'm lost can you show me something

[Verse 1]
I sit and reminisce on them niggas no longer here
And how I used to hit the mall and ya was always there
I sit and think how I didn't grow up with my father there
No need to cry cause it only made me stronger yea
I watched my brother get in trouble with the law and yea
That shit cut me like I was sitting in a barber chair
Cause I don't want to see them locked up in them bars in there
And I don't want to see him stretched out in a coffin yea
I'm wishing I can move my momma out so far from here
I know that she deserve much better and she worked hard as hell
That's why you never see me settle cause they want us here
I'm trynna side step the devil but he heartless yea
But just know that I'm a rebel and yo it's almost here
I'm talking bout the revolution I am Paul Revere
So dry your eyes momma please you can pause them tears
Cause I promise I'm gon get us outta here

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I swear I'm praying for my niggas when I say grace
I know them niggas don't care who they hit they spray strays
But lord please protect my family cause if they graze
Niggas is loading up that ammi and them A-K's
I know it's wrong and that revenge is all in your hands
But last night I heard they robbed and killed an old man
Now if they cold enough to take a life that's innocent
I know that they could give a fuck whether I live and shit
And so I'm asking you if you can hold me down lord
Be my umbrella-ella-ella in this downpour
I know you never ever ever let me drown or
Won't let that devil ever ever win this round naw
And though I stray for you, you know that my heart is good
And I know I ain't exactly living how I probly should
And I'm a try to act better like it's Hollywood
Niggas congratulate me I just tell them God is good
God is good

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yea, huh, yea my niggas drug dealing in the trap

Don't let up
You fall you get up
You make your bed up that you sleep in
Fake rappers ain't practicing what dey preaching
Hey tell you hit the trap while they relaxing on the beach and
I'm here to spit the facts
A nigga backflipped off the deep end
I smell this shit for what it is
Not kells but I love the kids
And so I make the song to let em know that they important
Cause them racist teachers couldn't give a fuck bout wat they score is
So they try to get them hands up on them Grants like Horace
Now slanging for you knoe it cops is knocking they got warrants
Damn!, uh, and how he running for it
Damn!, yea and now the cops is running for him damn!
And now he finally slowing down
Hands behind your head, lay down on the ground, nigga

[Verse 1]
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too

'Cause we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn

[Chorus]
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)

[Verse 1]
Girl, I messed up real bad
I'm looking back on the days that we both had
I go to bed and I dream so hard
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard
I need you close, I need your kiss
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than Puffy missed B.I.G
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song while holdin' the pillow tight
And wishin' that it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When I was blue, you were blue, you're my Smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet

[Verse 2]
Girl, I need you like I need air
And fuck these other honeys, I will be there
I never ever, ever thought that I would be scared
Of living in a world when you are not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
When you play this song on your MacBook
"Is that CG, yo, he's old news
I'm way too busy with my new dude."
The best time I ever had
Is kissing in my shitty ass Ikea bed
I wish that it was me instead
Feeling all your pain
I know that it is different now
It will never be the same but
I swear to God, our love special
You can be my number 2 like one pencil
Or you can be my number one, I will let you
In on my life, I've changed so much since you
Left, that hotel room
And if you're with another guy, go tell dude
That he could never keep us apart, he needs a better door
He'll always be the guy that you settle for
I'll always be the guy you're supposed to be with
Where the fuck is Cupid when you need him
I'm so Sam Cooke, I need Cupid too
I play Sam Cooke and I think of you

[Verse 3]
Baby girl we need to be together
This song ain't for my album
This song is for the better
And even though I'm living in a city full of strangers
They can see I'm different
They can see my anger
They can see my pain
They can see the way I talk about you
They see the way I'm living and I won't live long without you
I drink every night, I smoke more too
I think it is safe to say death or you
I need you more now than I ever did
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with
I need a second chance like I need a prayer
Sometimes I think God just doesn't care
I hope he has a plan for both you and I
So we can be together at a different time
Remember when I come home late
And you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate
I'll never do that shit to you again
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever known and my best friend
Baby girl we need to make up
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up
I'd rather die now than not have your touch
Cause I miss you so much

[Chorus: Bobby Vinton]
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
Oh, I'm so lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Intro: Akon]
Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave me

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…

[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & Akon]
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 2: Akon]
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
‘Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so…

[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, baby)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 3: Akon]
Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & Akon]
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 4: Akon]
Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…

[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & Akon]
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Outro: Akon]
So lonely (Lonely), so lonely (So lonely)
Mr. Lonely (Lonely), so lonely (So lonely)
So lonely (Lonely), so lonely (So lonely)
So lonely, Mr. Lonely

[Intro: DJ Drama]
K-Mac, ha
Look at her booty
We thinkin' like thirty-six
Did you see that booty?
Twenty-four, forty
Did you see that booty?
That's about right
(Trendsetter)

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, Judy got a booty from here to there
Make a nigga smile from ear to ear
Order three more bottles of that Belvedere
Then I point her out like, "You come here
You come here and you come here"
Booty sittin' higher than a flight of stairs
Some can make it clap, some really can't though
Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles
Speakin' of ankles, bend over and touch your toes
And pop it and make it roll, I'm lovin' this angle
Ha, I love this view that I'm lookin' at
Dressed so elegant, ass like a elephant
Shorty got me harder than I've ever been
So I'ma give it to like a motherfuckin' veteran
Body so sick so this dick be the medicine
And I don't know her name, she told me but all I heard was...

[Chorus: Kevin McCall, Chris Brown]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (Crazy)

She-She-She drop it low and speed it up, other niggas freezin' up
'Cause when they see that ass they like, "Damn, what you feedin' her?" (Gangsta)
Her-Her-Her body so ridiculous, I kiss it where she ticklish
Big booty world record, you can find it up in Guinness
And no-no-no, it's not a gimmick, shawty she the truth
And she got a big donk (Big donk), alley-oop (Gangsta Grillz)
Damn, girl, I'm horny and you know I want it
Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it
I tell her hold this, she got baby makin' hips
So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss
Mrs. Parker, Mrs. Parker
When you go let me (Ayy), Mrs. Parker?
She whispered in my ear, "Right now"
Then me, her, and her booty all smile

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (Crazy)

She gon' be my baby mama, she is all me
She's a bad bitch, greet her, "Hello, Barbie"

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (Crazy)

[Intro]
I ain't goin' no place
Move? Me?!
Give it up and you don't quit
Like that y'all pop some more shit

[Verse 1]
So, so, so, just sit back and max and relax
Off the tracks that I kick, come on and live it up
Cause I get funky like diaper rash (Nah)
And you know I'm mad spunky, and I'm making cash
Well, I got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets
To all you porno peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of AK
Like a sound that goes to the depths of the soul
Well, that's the feeling that I make my goal

[Refrain]
Music to rock the nation
Music to rock the nation
Uh, uh, check it out
Uh, leave it out

[Verse 2]
A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my Grape Ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mixtape
Cause I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train than Don Cornelius
Got the mad sub-woofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
The wires hitting switches connected at the junction
Perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in SD50 'til the early morning

[Refrain]
Music to rock the nation
Music to rock the nation

[Intro: Big Mike & Nicki Minaj]
Big Mike, the new baddest bitch in the game
She go by the name of Nicki Minaj
Let's get this shit poppin', playtime is over motherfuckers
This the one they was waitin' on, baby
I had to do it

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
(Kyuh) Just when they thought it was safe to play, I
Hit 'em with the N-I-C, the K-I
I'm Tinkerbell, he's Peter Pay-I
To these rap bitches, I'm Mother May I
I wanna know why you waste your time
On these rap hoes that don't write they rhymes
Get a can of Sprite with a twist of lime
Money, money, money, always on my mind
Coupe color purple, no, I'm not Celie
We run New York like we play relay
My flight took off, yours has been delayed
Give it to them early bitches, so don't be late
Playtime is over, when I spit bars
My mixtape bring all the boys to the yard
All the boys want Nicki, all the boys want mine
All the boys say they love me, yeah, they love me long time
Yes, I'm the girl that they heard of, I commit murder
I body bitches, I don't need a burner
Queens, oh, yes, I rep Queens
Little white tee, plus some tight jeans
I make it hard for these chicks to breathe
Wrist on freeze, I freeze up my sleeves
We gettin' money like it grow on trees
Stay on my Qs, I stay on my Ps
After I'm done, then you will acknowledge
I'm the president, never went to college
I'm a bad bitch, I don't need no stylist
Tell a bitch, hollas when she get my dollas
Bitches talk shit, but what is you sayin'?
Got the illest dude in the game speakin' my name
I'm the one, I'm the one, you heard me?
Same number they stitched on McGrady jersey
If I show you how to do it, would you reimburse me?
Let me put on my pumps, let me grab my skirtsy
I am such a little lady, let me do my curtsy
Fuck a dry pussy bitch, 'cause I know she thirsty

[Verse 1]
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, "Ow," make 'em say, "Oh"
The hoes that tell me "Yes," the same ones that tell ya "No"
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

[Intro: Jasper]
Swag me the fuck out

Chillin' in class (Ayy) with a bag full of grass
Lookin' for a white chick to smoke up and choke up (*Cough*)

Now you ready to get raped and ate by Mr. Haley
Litter Life is the gang, it's that shit that we bang
Let's play an Odd game, it's called "Bitch, You Better Run" (Awoo!)
When those Odd Wolves come out
And chew you up bitch like bubblegum, ha-tch, ha-tch

Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All Don't Give a Fuck

Two Nazi dykes shittin' in a synagogue
'Cause that bitch lick balls from Western to Crenshaw
And her grandma suck dick down in Rimpau

Taylor Swift come around, we go fuck in deep
She's our slut for weeks, and she wash our sheets
Brush our teeth, but don't make our beats
Tyler got the waffles, Devon cover bacon
2DopeBoyz got the beef, we serve filet mignon steak and

Wolves roll together like some family raccoons
Telling you to eat a ass like a fucking baboon

Kissing whores and kissing bunnies, put this horse dick in your tummy
I am on this track because that nigga Taco isn't funny

[Verse 6: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Jesus in the Humvee, Ace and Mary gettin' comfy
Jeffrey Dahmer's in the bushes with R. Kelly tryna fuck me (Steve Harvey)

Well fuck, Steve Harvey, and fuck that vase (Fuck that vase)

[Intro]
Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much, heh-heh

[Verse 1]
As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too (Swishers too)
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm (Aha)
I'm just a regular kid (At my crib)
Doin' regular shit (Burnin' five spliffs)
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'ma pour another cup and roll another zone (Roll another zone)
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back (Bring me back)
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at (Aha)
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me? Hit me on Twitter, heh-heh
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name (Uh)
Waitin' at the station 'til it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune, fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin' 'bout ('Bout)
Pour a little liquor, then I drink it down

[Chorus]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone)
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank God for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gates
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say, now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do, it's nothin' new

[Chorus]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah)
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone, heh
I spend another night alone (Spend another night alone) (Yeah)

[Outro]
Night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone, heh

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'mma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin' dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin' pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools wanna do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can do 'bout anything that you wanna do
But come up short and oh the thangs that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm makin' 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!

[Hook]
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam' I got a gamblin' problem
I don't know when to stop, maybe when somebody's
Drug away by the cops, or when I'm blowin steam
Countin' green in the drop, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the Strip to the block
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it
It's people livin' they life comin' up off change
And hustlers payin' they bills comin' up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate; catch me out in A.C
Callin' yo' bluff with Puff eatin' cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers

[Hook]
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breakin' the whole casino and doin' backflips, man
Cameras eyein' us, sidebetters tryin' us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buyin' us
Tryin' to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breakin' 'em, and dice still shakin 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em

[Hook (2x)]
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

But you right next to your man, don't let him run up on me
'Cause I see him tryna grill, better take his ass home
Before I lay his ass out, then I take your ass home
I even gon' front man, a nigga tryna cut
I ain't tryna take his place, I just want to hit you up
When that nigga ain't around I just want to pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up
Then I give you a massage, get you wet, get you up
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I lick it up
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up
Face down on your stomach, take that ass and lift it up

When you in the bed alone while ya man run the street
All you got to do is dial, let the phone ring twice
Baby girl I love your style, I won't even think twice
I ain't even gonna front, man a nigga tryna beat
I ain't tryna wife you up, though you is a dime piece
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak
How you throw it right back, got a niggas thighs weak

[Intro]
This morning, you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
Are you kidding?!

[Verse 1: Dave]
Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
(Look, it comes with a toy! I like that)
(I wanna number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut)
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Rappers of many bite sizes
(Man, are you freaking blind
That's a rock)
All mixed in the pot full
Momma's homemade from scratch, but (not quite)
Toasted over flames they be tasting (quite right)

[Verse 2: Posdnuos and (Dave)]
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"Don't waste time" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hour sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast

[Interlude]
A whole line of breakfasts you've got time for

[Hook: Gruff Rhys]
Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue
The night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

[Verse 2: Posdnuos and (Dave)]
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
"Don't waste time" with your net

Ready, go, many know others but

We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hours sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh, that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast

[Hook: 2D]
Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, whatever blue
The night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
Every boy and girl, woman to man

Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

[Verse 1]
Sometimes when it's late at, when it's late at night
And you have no one to talk to
Here's what you do
You go through that raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times
Tracy ain't home, Tina ain't home
The Love Below starts talkin' to ya

[Chorus]
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

Vibrate, vibrate higher

[Verse 2]
The circumcision has already begun
Desensitizing the very thing or thang
That brought you into this motherfucker in the first place
And when I say "motherfucker", I do mean "motherfucker"
Because Mother Earth is dying
And we continue to fuck her to death
Play with your own score sheet
Become the master of your own 'bation
And yes, God is watching you
But no need to be embarrassed
For the future is in your hands
No, the future is in your hand
Play with your own score sheet

[Chorus]
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You got one night only 

[x5]

[Lil Wayne]
And when they see me, they C-3 baby

She marks her calendar, reschedule every plan
She knows when I'm coming, she's more than a fan
She got my tour dates, she also got a man
But even homie gotta understand
She got (one night only 

[x2])
And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it
And when I go she'll miss it
But she'll never forget that (one night only 

[x2])
Next day another city, she's never coming with me
I'm nothing more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit together, she get her shit together
After my concert, she wanna get together
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special, then she remember
She got (one night only 

[x8])

[Lil Wayne]
But I can make you love me forever
Baby I can make you love me forever

Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later
Right now she with the greateast, I'm even homie's favorite
How could he even blame her, she doin him a favor
She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her
Take her for (one night only 

[x2])
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her pager
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor
(one night only 

[x2])
These niggas hate the game, but they can't block the layup
And she go home to him, he sicker than a patient
He waitin at the table, no breakfast at the table
He ask her where she been, she say stop trippin it was (one night only 

[x8])

[Lil Wayne]
But I can make you love me forever
I can make you love me forever, yeah

[Lil Wayne]
Them older bitches jealous, say she's a groupie whore
But every woman in this world was you before
See everybody wish to porn that superstar
But when it come true, how true you are
You got the (one night only 

[x2])
See, I can't be her man, and she can't be my girl
Oh, but we fuck like it's the end of the world
And we got (one night only 

[x2])
I got a wife, she knows, my wife ain't on the road
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes
Say anything goes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her

[Girl]
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You've got one night only 

[x4]

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Intro: Choir]
Lights, all of the lights

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give-or-take" world, I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time, I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh!
No lights but them infrared lights
Long knife, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go 'til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Whoa there, boy, don't go there, ho
If you cross that line, I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied, huh?
But every rapper named "Sean" got money? Ooh
Well, I guess my chances are fifty-fifty
But my vision is 20/20, so I be counting a hundred hundreds
Like, oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took your chick, now you want beef, and I'm just chuckling like I'm Porky
'Cause you spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and they want these bullets to book it for me, man
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin' broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gon' book report me, what?
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard (Hard), 'cause, bitch, I'm an emergency

[Chorus: Rihanna & Choirs, Big Sean]
Turn up the lights in here, baby (B-I-G)
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this (I do it)
Turn up the lights in here, baby (Boi, boi, boi)
You know what I need (Yeah)
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights (You know a nigga so good)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys, Big Sean, Elton John]
Whoa, whoa (So good, Westside)
I tried to tell you but all I could say was ohh (I'm so hood, I do it)
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 3: Drake]
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made five-thousand look like fifty
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush, but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made two million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I ain't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time," it's our time, so fuck y'all
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas was going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV, it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
(Lights on) And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy, nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
(Lights on) And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite

[Interlude: Kid Cudi, Drake, Rihanna & Fergie]
Gettin' mine, baby (Yeah)
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah (Shout out my nigga Cudi too, that's my motherfuckin' nigga for real, man)
Gettin' right, babe (Shout out Cole)
You should go and get ya own (Think we got a buzz now, nigga, fuck y'all niggas, man)
We're going all the way this time (I'm here)

[Outro 1: Fergie, with Rihanna, Choirs]
We going all the way this time
Lights, lights
We going all the way this time (All of the Lights, all of the lights)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time (All of the lights!)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
All of the lights
(All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Outro 2: Rihanna, Charlie Wilson, Elton John, John Legend, Ryan Leslie, The-Dream, Tony Williams, Drake, Alicia Keys, Alvin Fields & Ken Lewis]
All of the lights!

Ay, flyer than any nigga, get a skinny mini
Hit her on a shot of Remy, promise she don't get a penny

The number one pussy popper, for real, it's not just an image
Like tennis, get served while she licks her

Hey, hey!

I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around, you don't have to much to say
La, la-la, la-la, whoo, whoo

[Andre 3000 (talking)]
You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else

[Hook: Andre 3000]
Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

[Joi]
I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

[Hook: Andre 3000] - 2X

[Big Boi]
Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America...
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-Boy movin' fifty P's of that work
From A-Town to Dallas movin' cool

[Verse 1]
Back the hell off!
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin' to feel on
Rollin' like a motherfucker, put your wheels on
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone
I started on the block but that's somethin, to build on
And how can I pray when I got nuttin' to kneel on?

[Chorus]
Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down 'cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

[Verse 2]
Huh, walk on air
Show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain't high enough, au contraire
And sometimes life just don't compare
Sa-say my name, baby, pull my hair
And I'ma fuck you like a bull, I swear
I got a lot of love that I could just share
I got a lot of drugs that I could just share
I-I-I know, I know, what'chu like girl
A nice little mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float...

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby
Jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

[Chorus]
Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the

[Verse 3]
Hey, I know a girl named Crystal, her last name Ball
I look into her eyes, and I can see it all
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call
'Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill-kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin' what am I, be in spiritual fall
Huh, shit, 'cause ain't no love
Die while America drink yo' blood
It ain't no hurricane, it ain't no flood
It's some other shit that we ain't know of
Make that money, yeah, make that money
Then watch the government take that money
But we gon' raise hell, motherfucker get well
Laws get passed and economies fail
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion
Addiction, diction, virgins, dickses
Minglin', mixin', swingin', switchin'
Swaggin', sweet, freaks, faggots
Flames, fashion, planes, crashin'
Ground, zero...

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump jump jump out a window
Let's let's let's jump off a building baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a building baby

Hey! The ground is gone
Don't look now but the ground is gone
I'm so high that the ground is gone
And I don't even know which cloud I'm on
Don't look down but the ground is gone
Don't look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I'm a million miles from home
And I'm so high that the ground is gone

[Outro]
Let's let's let's jump off a buildin' baby
Let's jump jump out a window
Let's jump off a buildin' baby

[Hook - Eric Turner]
It's the way of the stage
It's like a stereo sun
It's the way I build up, the business really gets done
It's like a stereo sun

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
I hear it: the spirit, and I don't fear it
Matter 'fact, I steer it
Right in the heart of the hardships, I don't veer it
And this car is just a metaphor for my experience
No registration or insurance, just a license to ill
God's hands on the wheel, and my pedal's to the ceilin', peelin'
Speeding like 24 frames through the lights
With the traffic cameras filmin, brights
So I could see the brilliance of this life I've been given
Livin' to start a revolution every minute
Driven to win it, no breaks, no pittin'
Pole position ya soul, keep ya windows tinted
So we can see out it, but they can't see in it
So this here's ours, and them theirs rented
Cars moving at top gear, Jeremy Clarkson
I feel like this my first track and I ain't even start nothin, yessir!

[Hook - Eric Turner]

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
The sky's on fire, the storm is almost near us
But that's when I'm the clearest, when things are the severest
I'll be here for its arrival and for its disappearance
Broadcasting live and clear, even with the interference
See this is what it sounds like when life becomes lyric
The best thing ever, you should really come and hear it
But if you can't, cool. We'll be coming to your nearest, soon
Shining like two suns, it's better than two thumbs
The whole plot's to get you
To stop from doing what you do, to do better than you've done
Then we'll stare down the feds in the room
Who dares not to scare? Hear it, boom!
Unaffected by your werewolves, ghosts and your 'boom'
The tour through the tombs don't do nothing to 'em, never!
I turn the pressure into treasure
My problem's in the present and my presence is forever
Yes, sir!

[Hook]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo Doc, what up my nigga?
Snoop Dogg, this is what it is mane
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
I think it's time for me and you to just, tone it down a bit
Come on

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine, it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryna get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called "Pop" by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son, hm
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen, you go right to the gin
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in, hm
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryna keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop

[Hook: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, heeee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked you, "What you run for?" and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung-ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though, but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said, "Fuck this shit"
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in jail dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you
Fifty million records worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son?
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
Keep fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

[Hook: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, heeee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life
Before we go, can you imagine?
With your ears, clear your mind, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine? (Oh, heeee)
Lord have mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

[Bridge: D'Angelo]
Imagine, imagine
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, ow
Can you imagine? Uh
Can you imagine? Hm, ah
Can you imagine?
Imagine, imagine, yeah, ooh

[Outro]
"In the name of Allah, in the name of God
The beneficent, the merciful
The one God to whom all praise is due
Regardless of land, labor, or title
No matter what name you call God by
Whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must﻿ talk to God"

They play my song all across the globe
All black everything repping so heavily
Ready they better be girls they feelin me Soulja!!

[Verse 1]
My man, Shawn, from around the way, son, been down from day one
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one
Her name was Nina, see he was all about the cash flow
Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo
A true dime piece describin her, brown eyes
Caramel skin, thick thighs, goes beyond speech
But besides looks her mind's lost
Known for kickin cats to the curb, leaving their hearts on the sidewalk
Shawn was one of them, she said she was lovin him
But only fucked him because he had some funds comin in
He couldn't see it though
She was cheating and he didn't even know
He even bought a crib with this schemin ho
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed
I gotta hand it to her, she had the stuff planned out
But watch what happened when her luck ran out

[Hook]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Time passes, Shawn is thinking about wedding rings
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them
He disregards them, goes out for diamond ring shopping
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it
Waiting for the right time
Meanwhile Nina's the same ho
Like a snare drum but bangs way more
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well
Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like
"Yo son you won't believe this, I just seen your chick." ("Where?")
"In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass
I swear to God son. Need me to run up on him and drop him?"
"Nah, chill I got this, I'll hit you back if it's poppin"
He hung up, I called Nina, "Where you at? What you doing?"
"At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs."
Somethin sounded funny
She was lying for sure
But Shawn had a little plot of his own
Check it

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[Verse 3]
I missed you (Aw)
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's rendevouz (What?)
Yeah bitch you caught now
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)
You trifling ho, I gave my whole life to you yo
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)
But it's alright though, the same cat you was fucking with then
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)
Yeah get to crying, in a minute you'll be there beside him
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)
Visualizin what could have been between me and you
It was just just a dream, you fucked up the thing between us two
So now it's speak your peace before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)
I hope that shit was worth it
And now I pray that God is merciless
With this said, goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)
Pointed the gat to her mouth, long kiss goodnight (No)

[Hook x2]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Everybody's here with me
We've got no camera to see
Don't think I'm all in this world
The camera won't let me roll
The verdict doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go

[Chorus: 2-D]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

[Unintelligible]

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Stereo, I want it on
It's taken me far too long
Don't think I'm all in this world
Don't think I'll be here too long
Don't think I'll be here too long
(Don't think I'll be here too long)
I don't think I'll be here too long

[Intro]
Hey
And it's the best day ever
So pack your motherfuckin' bags, 'cause we gon' go
Pack your motherfuckin' bags, we gon' go

[Verse 1]
Hey, I got a
Cup of Henny, joint of good
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should
Catch a early flight, hit another city
For a concert full of fans who be fuckin' with me
Countin' hundreds, fifties, groupie hoes
That all love to show me how they drop they booties low
Two at once, that's a ménage à trois
Watch their bras come off, have me sayin', "La-di-da"
Rock 'n' roll, livin' life
Gettin' head, get it twice
It feels like I've been drunk for the eleventh night
Don't know how I'm gonna wake up in time to catch this flight
All these bitches in the front row tryna dress alike
They do a lot of barkin', but they never bite
They lookin' at me like, "I'm gonna have some sex tonight"
And yes, I might if it's alright, 'cause...

[Chorus]
I got what you need If you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause
I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause

[Verse 2]
First I
Take a breath, then let it out
Hear 'em clap a little while, then I take my bow
I'm on my job, but maybe out my mind
Got some liquor and some weed, it's about that time
Anyway you name it, I'm entertainment
I make it, I'll admit, I'm kinda famous
My life is like a vacation
'Cause day out and day in, these hotels, Days Inns
Travel navigation, I switch up my location
Days goin' without shavin', the road life's a bitch
But fuck it, this the good life, so for no life, I'd switch
Got my money comin' faster than these women I get into
Can't tell me how to live my life, chill, fool, I been cool
I'm the type of dude, pretty cool, kinda nice, not rude
'Cause some hoes who like my tunes
Get front row then show their boobs
Party every night, they worry that I blow the fuse
But I'm way too young, and don't know rules 

[?]

[Chorus]
I got what you need If you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause
I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip
Escape the world a little bit, maybe go and get a grip
This heart can be your drugs, just please don't take too much
You can have it free of charge though, I do it for the love, 'cause

[Intro]
Yeah, buddy
Weezy F. Baby, baby! Hahahahaha
Yeah, my type of shit
See—
When I do what I do, I do it
I said—
"When I do what I do, I do it"
That right
Haha

[Verse 1]
See, she all on my dick 'cause I make a lot of money
But I don't know why, 'cause she gets none— bring it back
—all on my dick 'cause I make a lot of money
But I dunno why 'cause she gets none from me
She only get dick way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends; now, her friends wanna— bring it back
—only get dick way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends; now, her friends wanna fuck me
I'm looking in the mirror, and I see a dollar sign
I had a CAT scan, and I had money on my mind
I tell a bitch, "Go and get my name on your spine
So I can feel good when I'm hitting it from behind"
I'm crack rock-fresh, baby, I'm that boy
Now, put me in a pot, and watch, I come back hard
Yeah, put me on the block, and watch: I come back rich
Now she done put me in that pussy, she ain't come back since, ha!

[Hook]
Ask dem hoes

Hat to the side, rims on the ride
It can't fit in my pocket, and I don't have to— hold up
Hat to the side, rims on the ride
It can't fit in my pocket, and I don't have to cock it
Scarface, bitch: Cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffing like them hoes 'bout to— hold up
Scarface, bitch: Cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffing like them hoes 'bout to cry
Ms. MySpace, don't blow my high
I download hard dick to your hard drive
Then, she got on her knees; that's when we locked eyes
She caught it like it was a routine pop fly
I'm dopeboy fresh: New jeans, new everything
Them bitches want me like a wedding ring
I told her that I'm married to the money, committed to the cash
All I see is pussy, titties, and a ass

[Hook]
Ask dem hoes
Yeah, ask dem hoes; ask dem hoes about me

Bitch, I'm a beast (Ask dem hoes), ho, I'm a dog (Ask dem hoes about me)

[Verse 3]
Call me "Weezy F.," bitch, I'm straight from the street
The dope game is sour, and the dope is sweet
I live in the towers, got a scope on the heat
Hit you from a hunnid feet—we don't even have to meet
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me, I will— hold on
Your bitch love me—we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me, I will do her
And if that bitch is crazy, believe me, I will sue her
Got some hungry-ass lawyers that will eat her up and chew her
I don't know how you love her; I wish I never knew her
She only gave me brain—she was just another tutor
She blew my whole band—I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick, and get lost in Aruba
It's money over bitches, Cash Money over bitches
Young Money over bitches, get money from them bitches—I do!

[Hook]
Ask dem hoes
Yeah, ask dem hoes; ask dem hoes about me

[Verse 1]
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself, if I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell, oh well, sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
'Cause plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga, I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top, you watching me nigga?
Then hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[Verse 2]
You was my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school, you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes, and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man, a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina? Man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? Yo, she still the baddest
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[Verse 3]
And these are tough times baby, but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top, I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A woman with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart, you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't, 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part, God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know I'm down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me

[Chorus]
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call, it ain't a problem
I can be there, I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I would die for you
So hold it down, and when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down, and it don’t matter how far, I’ll be around
Yeah, I'll hold you down

[The Dream]
I wanna see what's under there baby

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

My homies never see you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked, in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I type you a message full of X's and O's
You shoot me a video and then upload
Even though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[The Dream]
Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When you take the picture, cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch 'til I reach third base
And when I get home I'ma hit home plate
Wait, could this be considered our first date
Ye, the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it
You know what's a crazy thing
Some girls'll make you wait longer than A.C. Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty-three year old virgin
That's disrespectful baby, don't encourage him
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican, or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress White, but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby you up, question mark
And she respond, YES-S-S-I-R

[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
Uh, I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
Ah, I love it, girl, girl
You look right in the screen then take it o-off, off
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Outro: Jamie Foxx]
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, uh no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no
I ain't cheatin, no no
I ain't lyin, no no

[Intro]
Aha, ayo
I'm ready for whatever this world brings to me (Mac Miller)
I'm ready for tonight, I'm ready for tomorrow
And whatever's after that, you feel me? Let's get it

[Chorus]
We stay fly (Fly), new clothes on (On)
Smokin' on that Drake 'til I'm so far gone
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl, you fly (Fly), why we gotta wait? (Wait)
Let's take a drive, I need to get away
I'm ready (Yeah), I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh
Ain't a damn thing change, I'm happy to get away
Leavin' shorty's in the mornin', she's grabbin' on me to stay
But I'm ready for the next stage (Stage)
Just text me, she said I hit it out the park like Fenway (Aha)
Ayy, it's just one night's work
Have her stayin up late, then sleepin' in my shirt
Girl, I gotta leave now, I need to get to work
I'm a young heartbreaker, believe me, it's a curse (Uh-huh)
But hey, I stay focused 'cause the money come first
Take my real life situations, throw 'em in a verse (What?)
Uh, that's the formula for the truth
It's more than just what I do, I'm explorin' it for the proof (Uh-huh)
Who am I? Muhfucker, who are you?
Don't be askin' questions you should know the answer to (Right?)
You should know my name, don't forget me
'Bout to takeover the game, I'm ready

[Chorus]
We stay fly (Fly), new clothes on (On)
Smokin' on that drake 'til I'm so far gone
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl, you fly (Fly), why we gotta wait? (Wait)
Let's take a drive, I need to get away
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah
I'm ready to have the glory, I'm ready to have the name
I'm ready to have the fortune, I'm ready to have the fame
When I get up in the game, it's never gon' be the same
Those too dumb to notice, tell 'em to use they brain (Aha)
I spend a whole day on the cloud
Firetrucks comin' through tryin' get me down
Mom say she proud 'cause I'm stickin' to my dreams
Get myself out, head to bigger, better things (Better things)
It's the high life, boy, I live the fly life
Honey's want my number 'cause I rhyme nice, haha
Ain't that some shit?
She gave her girl a camera, said, "Can we take a pic?" (Click)
So let us speak a thousand words
Shorty says she want me 'cause I'm down to Earth (Haha)
It's all gravy, you won't forget me
'Cause I'm headed to the top, I'm ready

[Chorus]
We stay fly (Fly), new clothes on (On)
Smokin' on that drake 'til I'm so far gone
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl, you fly (Fly), why we gotta wait? (Wait)
Let's take a drive, I need to get away
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

[Lupe talking]
You know I had to do it, man
It wouldn'ta been right if I didn't
You seen it? You seen the show last night on TV?
You seen nigga's rims man? You seen the new Jordans man?
You see her ass yo? Yeah, yeah, that's crazy

[Singing]
Seein' with my ghetto eyes
I walked with my ghetto feet
I talked with my ghetto speech
I'm copacetic, I won't let it bring me down
Bring me down...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I say it's instilled
As I peep from beneath the titled brim of my pinwheel
Steady mobbin', heavy problems
Genocide desensitized to violence
Makes it hard to sympathize
Harden, individuals whose feelings is minuscule
Soon become criminals if you dark-skinned
And you was raised in a project apartment
Public Aid made it that your father couldn't stay
He had to part then, left with only a mother
The family structure suffers
He will soon cling to hustlers, as his guardians
He still a boy, needs to fill a void, marchin'
Up the block up to no good, sellin' in the wrong hood
He was taken down by a marksmen
At his wake, 8th Grade Graduation picture
Last words: Don't let the habitation get ya
Pardoned, Lord have mercy on the fallen
Amen, feel like I'm hardened
Got the harbinger for the coming of the carpenter
Til then, I got some big fish to fry like Marlins
Part niggas, steady mobbin'

[Chorus]
I've got some questions to ask
And I'm waitin' on some answers
Like, Why do the good die young?
Why ain't there no cure for cancer?
Won't let the streets dictate my glory
Cause it's something out there for me
But I'mma flee my territory
So I won't end up, just a ghetto story
Just a ghetto story, just a ghetto story
Just a ghetto story, just a ghetto story

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And I try to see past it
Through the down-roll window on
The driver side of my Caprice Classic
Steady mobbin', corner store traffic
I.e. dope fiends, hookers and teens with alcohol IVs
I see, plastic, cups is a nickel
50 cent for Dutch Masters
My big brother's Pelle Pel' lingers
Of a fargone weed smoke
Lookin' for greener pastures, pasturized 2% for $2.19
You can get 2 quarts, there's also a sale on Newports
A separate line for Lotto, bumpy face, add a model
Huggin' a bottle, salt and sour Jays, and blueberry Hugs
Shorties consider a meal, been my feel for it
Sweatin' for a pair of Air Jordans they would steal for
And a gold chain 4 fiends would
Knife, wild and kill yours
There's nothing too promising on our billboards
Drink Tanqueray, eat KFC, come abort your child
Buy Nikes, which makes it highly
Unlikely that we gon' fight, G
Steady mobbin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm still on
As I stroll down the same street so
Many like me once before, were killed on
Steady mobbin', thinkin' bout the Black Panthers
And the babies that were born in the late '80s
That now have babies that lack Pampers
No Kwaanzas and they lack Santas
And the father who thinks shoe-shopping is the answer
Skipped out on parenthood classes so
She don't know how to handle her
And never learned from her grandmother
One day got hot, couldn't take it
Dropped her in a vacant lot
Album of Life, now condensed into a sampler
See the shapes these little girls is gettin'?
Some say the steroids in the chicken is
The cause of the thickening in the young women
Livid, see some shorties playin' Cops & Robbers, livin'
Bittersweet thoughts is what I had for them
I can picture quota fillin' Police chasin' after them
Catchin' up to, friskin' and askin' them
Where the packs at? Who yo' chief
Is? Where the straps at?
Am I thinking too hard? Or perhaps that's reality
In a project mentality, but through it all
I hope we learn more than how to be
Whores and how to move a ball
Steady mobbin'

[Chorus]

[MF Doom]
He moves the crowd like a cursor on zoom
No curse words, DOOM the worst church nerd verse heard
Appeared blurred to a million true believers
He's the supervillain arm dealer to the divas
Catch, amongst other world scandals
Butter pearl handles to match your girl's sandals
Plan was hatched by a pack of old vandals
Whose flag was a black and gold patch with bloody anvils
"Hit 'Em to the Head" was the motto
And one more time to make sure them dead, BLAKKO
When you throw blows in a knife fight, Paco
That's how it goes in this Modern Life like Rocko
Clock dough 24-7 cycle
When it comes to flows he got more than a mic full
Pull a broad like a dyke bull on a long bid
You're messin with the wrong kids Michael
... it ain't Jack-son
For him to flip scripts like camera, action
Villain! Raw by the laws of attraction
For future generation's information - the black one
... Move the crowd like a buddha cloud
The purple, puff puff pass 'round the circle
A jerk well renowned for his work skill
He's out, the proof is the computer's down Urkel
MC a show via wi-fi
And paid way before we wrap it up like tie-dye
Hip-Hop sci-fi you can see
He had the eye of the tiger through the mask like the Fry Guy
Just made a baby Olmec dome check
Left some folks' ancestors home wreck
With blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil
It got no reason, like short people
No offense, his feet was burnt brass
Whenever he walked on the street it turned glass
On his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer
All the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slackjaw
Logic, to keep your mind in the project
Drop the check, his job is to chop necks
That's just payback for noses there's no psych though
What they don't know like Bo
Won't hurt Diddley squat
Got to be kiddin me, not
Seriously plot, to put a hit out on a G-spot
Gypped like Egypt out their kettles and they teapot

[Verse 1]
Momma, I just killed a man
My body still trembling, can you feel my hand?
Don’t shed no tears, it won’t be long before they find out it was me, Momma
This may be the last time you see me free, Ma, don't spend it crying
You did your best, me, I was blessed, know you were stressed trying
To keep me out the streets, me, ducking police
Trying not to make a peep to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skipping class, flunking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehow I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right, but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you 'shamed of me?
Dry your face off, Mommy, you're not to blame for me
See, I’m a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder ’bout my father, would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running 'round with the lowlifes?
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas kill for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger, Momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga, Momma
But what’s done is done
I’m on the run, I live my life like a movie now it’s way too realer
Who would've thought your baby boy would've grew up to be a killer?

[Chorus]
Yeah, now I’m a killer
Guess I’m a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah, I mean the killers

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"I mean—murderers! Do you hear me? Real live murderers!
I thought black people killed people by accident!
Nah, these motherfuckers was murderers."

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Yeah, I wonder what's in store for me, lately been stressing
Pray for blessings, hope that there’s more for me than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot, worked on the gunshot
Who woulda thought? I used to block this nigga's lay-ups
Now he’s in a cell layed up
I wish you well, stay up like insomniacs
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat, uh
I sip this cognac, though
To ease my brain from all this pain and so that I react slow
In this fast world, slow niggas, fast girls
Ho's give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on ‘em, hold up that old checker flag for ‘em
Chalk lines by the do not walk sign, it’s deep
All these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I’d rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell ‘em now boy, don’t make me turn into a killer, nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, into a killer
Don’t make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah

[Interlude: Richard Pryor]
"Triple life... How do you do triple life?
That mean if he die and come back... He gotta go to penitentiary!
Right there, he said "Fuck kindergarten. Get your little ass on in the penitentiary, motherfucker. You know what you did last time."

[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda ever thought that time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day, swore that we would make the league and be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, aw shit
Watch how they pile up, seem like a mile up
I washed the blisters on my hands and then I'd dial up
My best friend, skating rink is where we headed at night
And if a nigga disrespect, oh yes, we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seem petty, at the time the shit was heavy
'Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas got their brains blowed out
Snatch a niggas chain and he got his name wrote out
In obituaries, another body in a cemetery
Another young nigga in the penitentiary
And he don’t give a fuck: no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture, nigga: Pictionary
Tell you what it is, I’m a dictionary
I knew a nigga threw his dick in e'ry chick in e'ry
City that he went to, went hard like the rent due
'Til he met the wrong bitch
Her man just came home, ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers

[Outro]
Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I’m a killer

[Intro: T.I.]
What's happenin', man? This TIP, you know?
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin?
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?
But it ain't how I live while I'm here, it's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 1: T.I.]
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son
And his wife, he lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin' folk
And I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin' joke
I can feel my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch him, I'ma kill him, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not with me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he at his family house, let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments, he still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 2: T.I.]
You ever seen a nigga go to jail and sleep 'til day 2?
Well, that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru
Found out the hard way, that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heron, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap, with carryin' this here cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and ask to borrow my pistol ain't gon' happ'
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize, you died, that's why they say that

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Til you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot?
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushin' my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
"But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin' with that?"
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked

[Chorus: (Jamie Foxx) & T.I.]
(Life's ups and downs, they come and go)
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die, that I live in the sky
(It's true what goes around, comes back you know)
So when I die I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God, I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

[Outro: T.I. & Jamie Foxx]
Hey man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man
I miss the shit out you, my nigga
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy Jay-Ru
Jamar Hendrix, what's happenin'?
Also my partner Bankhead, Man Lee Horton, what it is, nigga
P$C for life, and death
And my lil' homeboy Poncho, and my lil' homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy
That's real talk man
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
Let me live in the sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
I want to live in the sky
Why can't we live in the sky?
The sky

Now ho don't ask me what I'm doing, thats me in the hook
And I just keep on kicking it kicking it like a knee and a foot
Yes, wayne straight like a ki' of that good
If your bitch don't know the rules, I will read her the book
I got the key to the boat, I got the key to the jet
I got the key to success, get money invest
Re-up with the rest. I got a Swedish connect
That means my weed is the best, homie, even the stress
OK, the coupe is ridiculous and the jeep is a mess
Let's call my bullets a lump, I put 'em deep in your neck
Adam's apple meet banana clip
You know my script, I just get my chips and then I dip, and then I dip
They say the bullshit walks, the money talks
So I don't answer, I don't answer unless the money calls
Yeah that's my word, thats my word know I will front for y'all
It's money over everything and bitches under all
M.O.B!

[Verse 2: Birdman]
I say uptown poppin', uptown rockin', uptown niggas
It's the home of the hard knocks
Cook up a whole block, kit it up in all white
Ridin' with a chopper, black diamonds and it all nice
Shop 'till you pop bitch, do your own thing ho
Got the game from K.C., second floor sixth court
Bling bling king nigga, money ain't a thing nigga
Ridin' in a Lamborghini, suicidal eagle wings
Assault rifles, my little homies big poppers
Coming through the attic, 20 in the heli-chopper
Zip it and whip it nigga, that's how we ship it, nigga
Burn it and light it then we flip it and we hit it, nigga
I spent a mill on my grill for real
Cause we be stunting while we hustling, nigga making his meals
We be grindin' while we shinin', nigga packin' that steel
Stay fly, get money, nigga stackin' the bills

[Hook]
We over here hustlin', we over here grindin'

Fifty a thang, nigga, a G a name, nigga

Hop out a Range, nigga. Thang in hand, nigga
Stop all that reppin', 'fore I... send some flames, nigga
All this money, nigga. Jewelry and fame, nigga
Cause we be stuntin', nigga. Moving them things, nigga

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Paper paper, paper. All I need is paper. Green paper
White chalk, yellow tape will, make your shirt look like you got on the butcher's apron
Go ahead and make the steak then, bitch nigga
Rich nigga talkin'. This is how money sound
I'm just chillin' but my money still running 'round
Yeah, and I just do's what I does
You niggas couldn't even be who I was

[Intro]
For all my ville niggas man
All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from

[Verse]
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'ma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

[Outro]
You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Man, don't you know that I'm loco?
Mhm, hm

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I was chillin' (Chillin') right around my way (Way)
21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said

[Chorus: B-Real & Snoop Dogg]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Post-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now there's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Post-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (Heat)
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be "Beast of the East", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Post-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

[Intro]
Ayo, Jerm
Banger, aha

[Chorus]
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right (What?)
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Yessir)
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Aight, check it, look)

[Verse 1]
I'm just foolin' around, comin' new with the sound (Uh-huh)
I give you music that pounds, start movin' the ground
I'm a wildfire, y'all just burnin' slow
Got that Midas touch with it, how it turn to gold (Aha)
You gotta earn your own chips, never lose focus
Bang it 'til your ears goin' deaf like Moses (Like Moses)
I'm on vibrate, buzzin' all crazy
Haters gettin' mad 'cause I'm fuckin' all they ladies (Aha)
I stay skeed, smoke until I can't see (Can't see)
Takin' pictures with a hater like, "Say cheese"
Yeah, I'm kinda young, weavin' where the vinyl's spun
But no practice here, so call me Iverson
But I'ma be ready when the finals come
Said I'ma be ready when my time'll come (Okay)
Gimme brain, get inside they mind
Go to sleep, wake up, now it's rise and grind (Oh, oh)
Ayo Jerm, tryna tell 'em, man (Go 'head)
Let's get it (What?)

[Chorus]
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around (Aight, look, haha)

[Verse 2]
Look when I come around and spit that flow (Uh-huh)
Three in a row, no Tic-tac-toe
Hit that Dro, get so blowed
Hold up, let's spit that slow, ooh, I'm high (

[?])
Y'all hatin', you gon' stop, I'm comin' to your block
Still hear my music knock (Aha)
Gon' take this to the top, I want the top spot (What?)
Spittin' them pop rocks (Uh-huh), the human talk box
I'm top notch and you ain't got a fan yet
Watch me blow they minds with some bars, call me Xanax
I ain't even goin' hard, told you my flow is sharp
And when the Dro is sparked, sittin' back: Rosa Parks
Don't call me lazy, I ain't just some bum kid
But I can bust wigs with every single drum kit
I like to joke a lot, I'm 

[?] I'm not
My moms is walkin' in the room like, "Are you smokin' pot?"
Blow the smoke out like, "Yes, I am"
So can I mothafuckin' kick this? (Yes, you can)

[Chorus]
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
Rise and grind, tryna get this money right
'Cause life's a joke, I'm the funny type
So I'm foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
I'm just foolin' around, I'm just foolin' around
Strugglin', lil niggas is hustlin'
Cops with the K-9 dogs they never muzzlin'
Buttons on apartment floors that we be buzzin' in
Theres something real, someone in trouble and all the youngin' em
I'd kill for my youning' em, feel for the youngin' em
Tryin' to make a mill, to make a meal for my youngin' em
Something I'm discoverin', when we start to love again
That'll be the day we get some peace
But other than that there'll be niggas in the streets
Mad when it's the winter and niggas can't afford heat
When the baby want jordan's but daddy can't afford sneaks
Like whats more important, a pair of J's or the feast
He look at his girl, he gotta provide
It's cold in the house, it's hot outside
And I don't mean that in a weather sense
There's stupid niggas on the premises
Brothers tryin' to be hard headed and so they hella dense
4 year murder still nobody found no evidence
Gotta live your life cause all that other shit irrelevant
Caught up in the light will take your breath up out your ???????
I read about this way back, back in genesis
This is for the mothers holding baby's in they stomachs
Going crazy cause their lover is never there, and rubbers were never there
When lusting you never cared, you frontin'
You just cared about a nut or something
Well something up in your mind was tellin' you don't do it, its too soon
Now you got a little daughter she'll be 2 soon
Plus a son up in your stomach he'll be due in June
And that father try to visit in a blue moon
Its safety still, life ain't a game its real
From the finch to the jane get filled
To the park and the scarbs all the way through steels
Lifes hard, sometimes the cut it might scar
If you live past 18 years your lifes long
Thank god for livin', them bad times we livin' em'
Prayin' that the youth gets baptised I'm serious
Niggas stop selling them cap size, get serious
Need to stop tryna be that guy cause really it
Really ain't worth your soul, ain't worth parole or probation
Life gets more crazy, gotta keep fighting guarantee your gon' make it
Times it will get so deep you can't take it
God gotta be the only one you leave your faith with
Safe it, sacred, place in the safe or the basement
If something worth chasing then chase it
This a serious thing, nothing to play games with
Can't trust friends, some friends will bring hatred
Its safe to say it nigga, its so blatant but God gotta be the only one to leave your faith with

[Chorus: Phonte & Mac Miller]
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh, like), I'll be there (I know you feel me)
For the good times or bad, I'll be there (I'll be there)
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (That's how it's always gon' be)
For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
See, I was six years old with a dream
When my moms told me I could do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity, think about what's important
The reason I was six years old rockin' some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV in the livin' room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the world's best mother
Yeah, it ain't fair, so I'ma take care of her in her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her livin' like she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me 'cause it's...

[Chorus: Phonte & Mac Miller]
Sunshine or rain (Uh-huh), I'll be there (I know you feel me)
For the good times or bad (I know you feel me like), I'll be there (Hey, hey)
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there (That's how it's always gon' be)
For the good times or bad (That's how it's always gon' be), I'll be there

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey, hey
Dear momma, please don't start to cry
You the reason I'm alive, how these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike ride
Ridin' in the street and that delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sittin' on the bench
And when I skipped school, you lie and say that I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just want to bring you out on stage to get a standin' ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say "Wassup?" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now, but remember bein' a kid
When she fed you in a bib, shit, you were her baby
So find out what she doin' lately
Uh, I wanna tell you, momma…

[Chorus: Phonte & Mac Miller]
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there (I know you feel me)
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
(Haha, what's up, Mom? You didn't think I was gonna make a song for you, did you?)
For the good times or bad, I'll be there

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey, haha
Hey, hey
Some shit ya just gotta say
Mm-hmm, like
Uh-huh
You know
My mind remain on gunplay
While y'all niggas sleep like Jermaine on Sunday
The heat stay packed like the train on Monday
Yes, I lick off the time you gotta be there, (nine)
Push by the time that you get off (five)
And I pump 8's till I reach lunch break (twelve)
It's bout the time that you get home (that's six)
That's the gist homes
That's the unofficial master plan
Minus any unforeseen traffic jams
Like my songs carrying the clubs like Bagger Vance
Or getting' caught by them long arms
Like Mr. Fantastic damn
But I can't fade like Fantastic Sams and taper off
I'm a better nigga man this is Edward Scissorhands with my back against the wall
Till I'm a V12 6er I'm a 130-round clipper
As if I was Elton Brand
But I could never leave Chicago
Unless heavily cargo, my jeans heavily argo
My stride is stiff see I rides as if
I don't need a helpin' hand, uh
Pride is this, never you see I is content
I'm slick I slde, I don't slip I ride
Don't flip I grind when the shit hits the fan
Like a line drive into the stands
The shoe fits the foot the mitt fits the hand
Misfits hollow tips hits ya man
Swallow nicks when dicks hit the land like
Snoop Dogg in his wheelchair
But I'm comin' from the Chi
And I flip pies
3 14-inch rims and they runnin' on the side
West that is, yes, F to the I (West Side) throw it up
Now back to the pies
Wasn't talking 'bout Snoop Dogg's wheels there
I am Farrahkahn with the Heroin
Salvatore Ferragamo on my feet
Pair of charms 'round my neck
Skeleton Vacheron on my arm
Gangsta, runnin the streets like marathon
With 26 Ks now lemme break it down I'm the leader of the pack
That's hard to believe if you fatiguin' in the back
I'm back to the master plan
I'm up front with the Africans
They swallow birds like Sylvester
It's the French connector Cooperstown collector
Yessuh my lifestyle's the shit
They shit lifestyles of that shit
Yeah
To sum it up I'm having a nice run
You have a nice one
Peace!

[Intro]
They know it, but I do, I do (Okay)
Fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude (Uh-huh)
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

[Chorus]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

[Verse 1]
Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of molly make the boy bite down
Thinkin' I could finally figure out my style on the stage
Lookin' at a big hype crowd
(They go insane when I run out on the stage)
'Cause we don't give a fuck, don't need to act our age, hey
When I'm old, I'ma spend my days
Layin' with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank God everyday I don't sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success, so I'ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God, he'll be impressed 'cause
I've been on my grind, thinkin' I'll be fine if I take my time
Workin' so hard, might break my spine
So all y'all see this face of mine
There's different ways to shine, I'ma find my own
Know when I disappear, I'ma find my way back home 'cause...

[Chorus]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

[Verse 2]
Days go by, and I think that I
May be goin' crazy, maybe lose my mind
Lookin' at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
God and I, sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut, playin' bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet, honey bee gonna sting though
I'm here, wanna do my thing
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna lose that ring
I don't pay her no mind
I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the game, just a little more flavor
Say, "What up?", take a flick with a hater
Throw a deuce like, "See you later"
Ha, that's funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life gonna be so sweet
Nah, it ain't a hotel, ha-ha-ha
Yeah, nah, it ain't a hotel
I'm next, shh, don't tell, ha

[Chorus (Extended)]
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air
I don't think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you fuckin' with it, then you my dude, my dude, uh
We always down to dap or give a pound
To those who got they thumbs in the air

[Intro]
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ho
Go with the flow
Ayo, I'd like to set this microphone 'fore I start right quick
Microphone check 2-2-1-2-1-2

[Verse 1]
Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who asked me what we don't got that you got son
For one flow that's elementary, my dear Watson
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chopped these drums off Truly Yours, G. Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black, I'm not the cool Sleestak
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be biting styles I'm like pork too
Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues, I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the styes from the cess
Shit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand
Throwing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan
It ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying
Fronting like you death-defying, need to stop lying
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you
With well refined rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(Yeah yeah, only them two)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true)

[Verse 2]
I'd like to say, "Hi, it's Sci.Fly, the odd Merlin"
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling
Who eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God tore but never see God hurlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself, I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose
Back to you MF DOOM, you late show host
S to the U to the P-E-R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3D horror
Thriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, Indian borrower
Lone gunman who candidly flip fly flows
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt Alayé
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's that inner smash way how he did it
Motherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute, it's the–
Exquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow
That's how we do it though

[Intro]
Uh
Jets nigga no one ever knew
Come to the Taylor Gang, rollin' up them paper planes
Kush and Orange Juice nigga
Sledgren, yeah
501 young, fools coming but they don't wan't none
What up Will?
Yeah bitch
I'm high so I said It like that, uh

[Verse 1]
Empty bottles of Clicquot and ashes on the flo'
Towel under the do', we wasn't supposed to even smoke
I ain't tripping, never slip or slacking on my pimping
Drop the nerds you with, come smoke a joint with he who's winning
Ain't like them guys who wine and dine to keep they women
My bitches only want two things, that's to get high and kick it
Try my pot prescription, take a couple shots with lemon
Usually have to watch a movie to see how I'm livin'
Yeah, so what's the hold up
Waiter bring the bottle get them EZ-Widers rolled up
Self made G, did everything on my own, bruh
In my early twenties with money as wide as Oprah

[Hook]
Crack another bottle, get the weed rolled up
And girl you know I got it, everything's on us
I toke a lot cause I'm getting bank roll
And they follow me anywhere that my plane go
Say she never been
Say she never been
Say she never been
I'm getting bank roll
And they follow me anywhere that my plane go
Say she never been

[Verse 2]
Crack a window we gon' smoke this indo
Saying that you still high from last night
You try to pass, trying to beware of the fast life
Kick it with the planes and it'll be your last flight, yeah
OG hash, let you stumble to class right
The sex great, no I don't give her no half-pipe
Housekeepers knocking, we don't let 'em in
Rolling doobies up, room with a Jacuzzi tub
(Say she never been) In the game, I am a veteran
After we fuck, roll the doctor-prescribed medicine
Let you hit it once, then you sleepin'
A fly nigga traveling the world, taking your girl for the weekend
Keep it

[Hook]
Crack another bottle, get the weed rolled up
And girl you know I got it, everything's on us
I toke a lot cause I'm getting bank roll
And they follow me anywhere that my plane go
Say she never been
Say she never been
Say she never been
I'm getting bank roll
And they follow me anywhere that my plane go
Say she never been

[Outro]
Louie Luggage and all
Fuck with the Taylor Gang, Spring, Summer, and Fall
And Winter too
Yeah bitch
Germ on the boards

[Verse 1: Adele]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever
Pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's
Bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep
Me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me
Breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus: Adele]
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands

[Verse 2: Adele]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

[Refrain]
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep

[Bridge]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it--

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Swag
You think that I keep fucking other girls, you know I'm not
Come back to me like hipsters to Blogspot
Let me kiss you on your neck and make your heart stop
I'll give your new dude a fat lip: Pharcyde
I wrote another song, I'm not where I belong
My eyes water when I see hers: catalogue
I never thought you were a cheater, that was all
I need to get ahold of my head: jacking off
You ran back to them grody-ass indie dudes
James Perse cardigans, scuffed-up tennis shoes
Wow, girl, that's what you really wanted, huh?
A Michael Cera knockoff, I guess I wasn't white enough
You said I wasn't capable of loving you, I never was
A twenty-something nigga touring the world with hella buzz
I'm saying that my life's swell: cortizone
Fuck Macaulay Culkin, never going home alone
IPhone photos, show 'em just to mock you
Read your Twitter messages, too proud to block you
Spread shit around, "You know that his glasses fake"
That's why I'm dating girls now whose asses ain't
"Damn, Donald, why you gotta be so mean?"
I'm a nice guy, that's why you broke up with me
You probably in the club dancing to this right now
Play it cool, text me when you walk out
It's just childish
It's just childish
It's just childish

[Hook]

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Hahaha
So I'm go, no BlackBerry's, no iPhones, none of that
We just go off the top, no written, no nothing
Uh, uh, and the beat drops
Uh

[Verse]
I feel a little bit forgiven
Thank God, allow me this day
I feel so high when I be livin'
They can’t stop me, know how, uh-uh, no way
I don’t play, me and Tim, me and him, we rocks out
L-U-P do that, no shoes, just some socks out
I'm relaxin' in the club, DJin', playbacking
Everything that I do, they don’t know what happen
They be tryin', I deny them at the bucket, I say fuck it
If they want it then they love it, if they don’t then they can suck it
And, what I mean by it, you should re-try it
I’m on my Dean, you be on a dean-diet
And I dont even like it
Everytime you rap it, I swear I close my eyes
I wish I could close my ears from this racket
I ain't having it, I tennis while you bin it
I stay on it, I strong as Popeye with some spinach
You as long as short something
You be tryna ten it see
I ain't going HAM, I’m going bacon, going pig
I’m going whole cow, look at me, what I did
You wish you could, but you just kid
I’m a grown man on it, my own man on it
Come in your house, now your home damn haunted
See everybody dead, bullet holes in the head
But I ain't kill em, I hit em with the flow instead
My flow like bullets, they like hollow tips
I wish you would if you could, if you would try it
But you can’t so back to denying the
They be lying ah
I be so up on my truthless and I’m so ruthless
Ferrari top down yeah I got like four of those
And my Ferrari so clean it got four doors
Only got two LUP on that new shit
New Ferrari 400i, that blue kit
So I got my rims and my watch and my rings on
Yeah I got my bling on
Go ahead and sing songs
If you want I tell no tales and no lies
I drop no dimes on my homies
I keep them alive behind the bar
Shout to Chilly chill, I’m so really real
And the streets so deep, you wish that I wasn’t but I am cousin
God damn he be buzzing
No weed no liquor, MD offa something
See my brain just flows and see just how I goes
And I’m from Chicago and I’m letting niggas know
You can cut it out and scratch it or baste it
Or send it through the strainer but please don’t waste it
Make sure you clean the plates when I’m done cooking
I’m Lil B, I am big ME, you little he, ahh
Sometin’ better, theres none of that, I’m running rap
Everything around it like hustling trap, stuntin that
Everything you bad at, I do so well
Then I eat the whole beat than put it on sale
That means I put it out to sea
You never get it back
It’s only coming back to me, uh
Indeed, it’s the LUP, Tim Westwood on our BBC Business
Flip the beat up and bring me another track
Some of that, uh, some up all up under that
Bring the sun back, that be me I'm so on fire
So higher like the moon and I will not retire
But maybe soon but, maybe that will be that noon uh
Then I wake you up for it and pace you up for it
Uh, if you got it take you up on it
You can roll the dice but, promise you don't want it
See, you ain't really on it, you be on some other shit
I be on some wonky shit and be on some tonky shit
Takin' it and walking' it, L U P be stalking' it
Round the corner dressed up, so tight, no light
Unlike anybody ever seen too clever
Flowing off the top of the dome to whoever's beat
Uh, and whoever's neat I'm nicer
I'm more bling, more clean, more play - no dice uh
No dice cuz, see I don't roll that
Don't believe in luck just bringin' confidence
Constantly, consequence of tryna defy is not nice
You be so dead, uh - twice
Kill 'em again, and again, and again
The adrenaline that's flowing up in him
Uh, and you know it something special
It's damn near incredible I should eat this
Uh-uh uh, uh
I love my way but I'm back up on my path
A rapping wrath, a chaos spiting
Uh, It's more gripping
It's more intelligent and more thrilling
Than anything that they can do even though they top billing
See, I be underdoggin', I be underloggin'
Uh, it's something special someone better off them
It's damn near awesome but more like incredible
You can't eat me nigga I am so unedible
But if you swallow it's like swallowing glass
Got a belly full of doo
You can't stomach got a belly full of 

[?]
The audacity of them to think they rapidly ascend
I'm so aggressive or in the rage I take them off the stage
Skytel I bring it back just got a page
I'm like Tron, step up in the 

[?] it's the Don
See what' going on and in my own world
You can keep your home girl I got the whole world
In my hands in my palms, uh something like a bomb
Around the chest of some suicide vest, nah
It's Vietnam here, you keep it calm there
Cause you don't want none of this with ya
I hit ya, and git ya, split you, and brake it down
Bag it up, go to the hood take a route
Uh, take another shot, take another three
These are all bars 

[?] music and you can't see
And can't beat what I am, that's a A+
Uh, I hope God wanna save us
If they won't save you
Play too damn much messing with the homeboy, ya
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Fire flame spitta
On another track, don't want none of that
With no water and no slaughter
No breaks I just continue on, with no takes
I keep going, I keep flowing, no stopping that
And see everybody watching that
See I got the lock so I'll be locking that, you can't get the keys
Especially from me, I keep them so excited in my pocket
You'd better watch it, and matter of fact you'd better stop it
I'm too hot, better hopscotch it and go up down the block
You might catch a shot, one two
Blat, blat, blat -
My flow is like...Heckler and Koch
Hit you up straight
Niggas aiming for your face when I come through...
I ain't hitting hearts, I'm just aiming for the brains
Trying to make'em smarter and take'em out of danger's way
And say maintain today
I show the shorties how to maintain the way so righteous
The nicest and do it like is priceless, iceless
No, I got a couple those watches and a couple cars
And I keep a couple flows and a couple bars
And I keep a couple hoods and a couple stars
In my back pocket and you can back watch it
You better backstop it like it's cricket
I keep a wicket googly when I stick it, be like the Batman, hitcha
You can come through just like don't pitch it out
I'll knock it out the park, it'll be so dark
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I roll
Flowing like ether, burning niggas down
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it down
Yeah, yeah, it feeling like an iPod
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East, I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market

Lookin' forward to the weekend
Um, so this next song is about love, appropriately

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
I love you like kings love queens
Like a gay geneticist loves designer jeans
I need you like New Orleans needs a drought
Like Hitler's father needed to learn to pull out
And I want you, yea, like a lawyer/mathematician wants some kind of proof
And I want you, yea, like JFK wanted a car with a roof
Cause love is takin' a dive
Then gettin' really comfortable and peein' in the pool
And love is real life porn minus all the stuff that makes porn cool

And love is a homeless guy searching for treasure
In the middle of the rain and finding a bag of gold coins
And slowly finding out that they're all filled with chocolate
And even though he's heartbroken, he can't complain cause he was hungry in the first place

I love you like Dora loves maps like the Pope's toilet loves holy craps
I need you like a voyeur needs a branch
Like boys tossing salad needs a little bit of Neverland Ranch
And I want you like all the Gothic kids
That look exactly the same never want to conform
And I want you like Anne Frank wanted
Nobody to read her fucking diary
Cause a diary's a collection of secret things
That no one is suppose to read thats the whole point of a diary
Millions of people have breached this little girls privacy
After she was chased by Nazis kick her while she's down

And if we met in 10000 BC I was your caveman youz my cavelady
If we got hot we'd start rubbing
If we got hungry we'd go clubbing
Theres wooly mammoths but I will protect us
You're making me devolve to a Homo Erectus. Oh

And if we met in 1780
I was a white Southern aristocratic plantation owner
And you were my dark-skinned servant lady
Slave, whenever I could get away from the misses
I'd go to your shed and then i'd steal you kisses
But let's be serious i'd still work you full time as a slave
There's a difference between romantic language
And a complete disregard for socio-economic trends

And if we met in 1941
I was a Nazi youz a Gypsy on the run
That's a little redundant
That, probably wouldn't've worked out
Because love is your favorite food for every breakfest, lunch and dinner
And love is the Holocaust if you don't die quick and you don't get thinner
And love is being the owner of the company that makes rape whistles
And even though you started the company with good intentions trying to reduce the rate of rape
Now you don't want to reduce it at all cause if the rape rate declines
You'll see an equal decline in whistle sales
Without rapists whos gonna buy your whistles
Whose gonna buy your whistles
Love is all about whistles
Thank you

Uh, that one was a bit vulgar, but uh, y'know
Dicks and vaginas are kinda like Coke and Pepsi
Uh, I strongly prefer one but my dad thinks they taste the same

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]

Nothin' like them other lil niggas, I'm me

Yeah, wear your seat belt, you gon' need help
To these niggas I'm Neil, on them bitches I'm Lee Phelps
My jeans fit, I don't need belts
Still spending grands, just to hold up my pants
Tats in my skin, neck, face, and my hands
OZ's on the road, Kush roll when I land
Takin' shots, writin' Taylor Gang in the sand
And everywhere I go, hoes know I'm the man
A superstar, you niggas are livin' street dreams
I'mma call all my haters and form a street team
See, I'm that level of greatness, you somewhere between
And I've been gettin' this cake since I was a preteen
And my swagger is peaking
Nigga, look at my watch, your shit is peeking
Your emotions are leaking
You niggas jealous, I can smell it
Swag

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

And, oh, they chase me down when I'm on the road
My face is known in every state

[Verse 3: Lavish]
Got her goin' nuts like a nigga never ever knew her
Rollin' with a star, need a dime lookin' Hollywood
And I be off some shit that have me high, prolly off some Kush
Too many numbers in my phone, copped a few, another few
Because she know my name, she know you're lame
She fuck me 'cause she know a nigga Taylor Gang
Every time on the road she showin' love in every way
Always with the baddest bitch that show me love in every way
Party in my hometown, feel the breeze in every state
Boy she got a booty on her, looties all up out of state
I been on this fly shit, the shit that niggas try, boy
Up in niggas' plans, why you niggas tryna fly, boy?

[Hook]
Just take a look at the way them diamonds glow
I know why you niggas hate
You know we get this dough in every way
And, oh, they chase me down when I'm on the road
My face is known in every state
Them bitches fuck me 'cause they know my name

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
(Yeah, to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, c'mon

[Verse 1]
Young bull
I know you love me like you never loved
You know you couldn't find a better thug
And, uh
You been peepin' me since I was younger
So young that you even called me your little brother
But I'm all grown up now, I got my own money
I'm married and divorced and my daughter is a woman
And guess what? My daughter want another
Sister or brother, and you lookin' like a mother
I took you from a clubber to a lover
And you took another bitch husband, the other bitch wasn't
Doin' shit for him
She say she did too much, I say she did nothing
She need to quit frontin'
I haven't hid nothin' and you love everything
Can't hide your feelings, won't let my pride conceal it
You got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby, you can keep the change, but

[Chorus]
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away

[Verse 2]
Destiny Child CD, song number three
She cater to me 'til we fall asleep
Then we wake up and we pick up where we started
Then she make a nigga breakfast, Sprite, orange juice, and water
And she on stage waitin' for me after my show
So no time for groupies, straight to the top floor, yeah
Fresh out the shower, a smile and a towel
Then after an hour, she gon' need another shower
When I'm at home in my coupe or in the office
Or the streets of the Boot, I'm thinking 'bout you
And most of the girls that come by are cute
And they try to holler, but they all on mute
And my old girls turn they face up at me, yeah
They throw they purses and they makeup at me
'Cause you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby, you can keep the change, but

[Chorus]
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
It's kinda hard sayin' this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take me away

[Verse 3]
Come home, smell the food on the stove
She done cleaned the whole house, washed the dishes and the clothes
And when we out, we do it just how we supposed
Look good for the public, leave the drama in the Rolls
Royce, choice of car that we move in
She get high sometimes 'cause I'm always doin' it, yeah
You hear them hallways, we always doin' it
Work her, every time feel like the first one
Perfect when a nigga stressin' at work
She take away all of the pain, make it lesser than dirt
That's why you got Wayne, I charge it to the game
And baby, you can keep the change, but

[Outro]
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt)
(Yeah, to redeem your love, that's exactly what I need)
I got you
(I got to hold on, hold on to my receipt), yeah
It's kinda hard saying this shit to your face
So I do it over snares and bass
Music take her away

[Skit: Eminem, Gary]

["Everybody's Looking At Me" plays in the background]

"I'm gonna kill this bitch. I'm gonna kill her. I'm going to fucking jail 'cause I'm gonna kill this bitch!"
"Yo, man…"
"What?"
"I don't know, I got a really, really bad feeling about this…"
"Man, would you shut the fuck up, Gary!? You always got a bad feeling, man! That's her car right there, just park."
"Alright, just let me park… I'm parking!"
"Fucking turn the car off, dawg."
"Aight…"
"Aight, we wait."
"We wait for what?"
"We wait until she comes out, and then I'm gonna fucking kill her."
"Man… you ain't gonna kill no one—what the fuck did you bring that for!?"
"Man, shut the fuck up, dawg. Just shut up. Fucking clip is empty, it's not—" 

[Eminem reveals the empty gun magazine]
"Man, don't point that shit at me!"
"It's not even loaded, bitch, look." 

[Eminem pulls trigger, unloaded gun clicks]
"Dude! God, I fucking hate when you do that shit."
"Yeah, but it's funny as fuck."
"Gonna fuck around and kill me one of these days, I swear…"
"Gets you every time."

["Soldier" theme begins to play]

"Is that her?"
"Where?"
"Right there, motherfucker."
"Oh, yeah…"
"Aight, get down, get down."
"Fuck, here we go again…"
"Get down!"
"…The fuck? You want me to get under the car?"
"Yo, who's she walking with?"
"The fuck am I supposed to know? You told me to duck down!"
"It's the fucking bouncer... Did she just kiss him?"
"I don't think so."
"Dawg, sh—she just fucking kissed him!"
"No, she didn't."
"Sh—she's kissing him, dawg."
"No, she's not!"
"She fucking kissed—" 

[Eminem exits car]
"Aw, shit…"
"Come on."

"Marsh!"

[VERSE 1]
Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mine is Polo, and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

[VERSE 2]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would

[Hook]
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[VERSE 3]
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And I'm going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me

[Hook]
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

[BRIDGE]
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

[OUTRO]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it us?
Can I love you all of my life?

[Verse 1]
Thank you
I've been through it all
The fails, the falls
I'm like Niagara
But I got right back up, like Viagra
I am agri-culture
Swagger so mean it might insult ya
Hah, I'm like an ultra-vulture
I fuck around and catapault ya
Torture
Thought ya parents taught ya?
You guys is chocha
I'm gone, buenos noches
Flow scorcher
And I don't even write — No author
So harder, so smarter
All about a dollar, like four quarters
Oh Father, will tonight be my last?
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash
And I know, I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!

[Chorus]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way
'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it
Say I need it

[Verse 2]
C-A-R, T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-er
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, spit sickle-cell psycho
I go
Off, like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from
The underground baby, like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles
Until the light blows

[Chorus]
And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling
Living what I believe in, dog
And it's a problem when our homies not eating
And I'm greedy
I'm greedy

[Verse 3]
Share my blood
Feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Gray's Anatomy
Acid, like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Ay, Juelz
I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches tryna kick it like Juntao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off, like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby—great!

[Chorus]
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G –
It won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until you're riding to the late me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him every day for my achievements
And I'm Weezy
I'm Weezy
Yes, I'm Mr. Big Stuff
Yeah, my stuff big, man
Keep a girl's pussy bright red like a pig's tan
Four shots and watch me lean like a kick stand
I really need to change my name to, "Hey, I'm a big fan!"
Cause that's all I hear when I'm outside
And my hoodie's never jealous of that tie-dye
Cheesy on the mic, like I'm laying on Jordan
No homo for you niggas homophobic

Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Tobey
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe
Got money trees, asking me, "Do you grow me?"

Latin girls kiss my feet like they're Superga
Latin girls see your face and call you "stupida"
Yes my name is Childish, so I guess I'm cheesy
Yes yes yes my wallet's cheesy
Throw your hood up, are you queasy?
Yes, I am the Juggernaut
Yes, my name is Elroy
Yes, my dick will make that ho tell, like a bell boy
And I get my tip, and my tip is in your girl
And I'm gonna bust a nut like I'm a Gallagher squirrel

It's the man of the hour
Better yet, the century, check the whiskey sour
Lookin' like I'm drinkin' piss
How's he fuckin' thinkin' this
Easy, I'm a mentalist, but I'm not on CBS

Uh, yes it's me Bam-B
What is your daughter to do?
I've been doing this ever since Harry Potter was new
Boy! I don't play, I change games, I am too real
So my words stay hard like a blue pill

I like pink, it always looks good on me
And I like pink, it always looks good on me
That second part I was talking about vagina, homie
Fuck the game at an early age, now there hymen on me

Yes, I am a magnet
Yes, I do attract it
Remember when these fake ass niggas called me faggot?
Cause I had glasses and a pink track jacket
Now those things are assets to help me get some asses
Now these nerdy hoes keep asking me to smash it
Bullies from middle school chatting on my Twitter status
Fuck you, you don't get shit from now on
Unless you got a demo tape, then I can lay some brown on
It's the B to the AMBI, colors like candy
Nigga, I'm the Army. I'm being all I can be
Yes I dress dandy. Get a Klu, like the Klan B
I live hard, I never sleep in, like an Amby

This is for the niggas thinkin' different
While their friends are flippin' pigeons in they're stay po-pimpin'

He never lets the best go past him
My life says yes like it's having orgasms

[Verse]
First of all, I ain't feeling y’all, feel the fucking heat defrost
Spill the spoon full of food, ain't enough to feed the room
I don’t have to fucking goon, twizzler boy split you too
Cherry red Rover roof, Crips to confuse you
You can say I blue’s you, better than I bruised you
All you niggas copycats, doing shit I used to
Oh you tatted too, nigga fuck you
My bitch ain't got no tats, I hit it from the back
I spend South of France, all that other shit is whack
Sling shot it in the ear than I let the shit collapse
Money is my pet peeve, give me hourly
If there is none at all, then I’m pissed off
I listen to Rick Ross and I know Ricky Ross
I’m Leonardo in Inception, reserve my section
I do dreams, put you in a Bubble, Benz or Lexus
I Will Smith the necklace, I do it effortless
Bitch all eyes on me, the future’s in my eyes
Money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga jealous, then the motherfucker dies
Figure you ain't scary if you did the crime
Now prepare, it's dinnertime, dimmer the lights, lemon with ice
Look in it twice, it's fizzling Sprite
Brown do the belly nice, no Coca Cola, I don’t drink soda
Black beanie nigga like a fucking smoker
They say I’m about to blow up like super nova
Put your helmet on, the bulldozing dopest
How you shitting on ‘em and ain't got shit up on ‘em?
It kills me to know it, you Melanie Fiona
Oh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Oh, remove yourself, remove yourself
Oh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Pull your ho card, I thought I told you oh

[Hook]
We got 'em goin' down for the count

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yes sir it's the beast from Decatur
Can't see enemies and the haters
Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade, come clean like a shape up
So guess I got a game of tape up
But e'rybody gonnaa feel the need to say sum'n
But can't speak up whenever you face 'em
Thats what I call microphone gangsters
Yea I got 'em okie-doke, yeah I'm raw you know my flow
Cause folk be actin hard like a Viagra overdose
Talkin that noise on all them songs
A buncha lil' boys but you all look grown
Those niggas stuntin and these niggas stuntin
It really don't matta cause they all just clones
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause
Ain't tryin to get involved with the law sir
But a nigga will get caught with the Mossberg
And that just ain't a threat on the song
Don't get it wrong cause this track is my own
Cause niggas that slip they don't last long

[Hook]
We got 'em goin' down for the count
Lookin' at the ground

[Verse 2: Wes Fif]
Hey - what the heck, breathe homie, me I'm doin what I always do
Grindin if you wasn't steady hatin you'd be ballin too
I know you see us fallin through, all the rich niggas is on my crew
Fuck it, they can't touch us, if stuck up is what you call it cool
Ooh~! You shoulda seen when I came down in that
Black on black, custom gator, haters face down on the mat
Splat! Yeah I can make a green nigga mad
Quick, fast, flash like ten cash on his bitch ass
You can tell I'm a G by the walk and the stance
How I play the game make 'em talk in the stands
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man
If it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand
I, I, show you how to get rich
You got a weak arm I'll show you how to pitch
Made it so play I'll show you how to hit
And tell the police I don't know about shit
Ay guy, I'm fly, somethin like the air
Ain't that somethin when it's stuntin man there's nothin like air
Homey hold it right there, homeboy hold it down
Spent five at the mall and had the haters goin dowwwn

[Hook]
We got 'em goin' down for the count
Lookin' at the ground
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go

[Verse 1: Tyga]
It's breaktime these kids is caught like Dateline
Deep fine obliterate if you dare to take mine
Genocide we don't give a fuck color or size guys
Women children could see I'm the shrine for the fucking blind
Vietnam mama BORN , her son know nothing but war

I'm winnin by 4 steps steppin ahead of ya'll
Cap a don college never was sent to school
Testin me students never do
Teach niggas cold then a pair of weather
Don't worry if it's red or blue
Green fake shit like tours do
Passenger grab the damager in case they start askin us
Managers show manners cause they see me on cameras (nigga)
Word of mouth tyga travelin tourin the south
Haters gatherin gossip shit I know nuthin about
You round cows sittin around I'm milkin yo spouse
Hey mr. child owners honored to have a rappers smile
Yiffey yup know a bitch that'll stick a nigga up

Dumb what the hell are you on?
Tomorow yo shit'll be pawned
Withdrawled credit cards

Next to condoms cause I'm like fuck it
No, pause games, I'm 19 with lots of bunnies
Young money my dougy

Accounts with large amounts you little pocket money
Car body sylvester color
I'm somewhat of a son from a different cuttin
Juice n buttons pussycat tygas comin

Patience young patrient

Bought a twin cause niggas ain't close to him
Potion clone n patron n a sober bitch
Hopin hopefully ya cloweys them I'm jizzin all over it
Dope women fuckin position ya ass where my tummy is

Fuck with me betta bring yo lunch cause it's gon be a long day

Let that tough talk walk and watch how you fear run
Yah, and fuck the world is my assignment
And I promise you gon feel me like blind men
Roll or roll over like front wheel alignment
Tell the lil rappers don't come near the giant
Ugh now I'm smellin my self

Startin to feel like Makaveli myself
Watch I put that muthafuckin Mac 11 to your scalp
Yes my maybach I swear that bitch a donkey
Had to get the long body cause the choufer didn't want me
Muthafucka I'm ill, hungry still
Greedy that's why my first week I got a mill
It's young money open the bar

No kelly just n.o. and l.a
We come to fuck shit up like broke levays
Got a california bitch I swear she a medic
Sometimes she give me head and just git rid of my headache
Pull up and shoot like JJ Redick

Which one of you niggas wanna g get it?
Keepin yo head up but your beheaded uh oh
Realest is my middle name my heart pump nitrogen
And I breathe fire better stand by a hydrogen
Duffle bag big enough to fit the rifle in
I'll cut yo ass short call me hyphen then
Yes I'm focused on the figgas fresh

It's the president sittin behind the bigger desk
Secretary with bigger breats
Handin me bigger checks

And the judge trynna hit me with everything but the sink
But I won't sink I can't I ain't
Breaktime

[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Yessir
Uh oh
Uh ohhhhhhhh
Haha

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Sick with it, six digits, big engines
Get lots of head like 6 midgets
It’s just the code I live by
Represent the road I grew up by
And I see the game like an umpire
Motherfuck one time, and everything combine
I am the boss I have a nigga tell ya bout the gun line
I’m in the hog sometimes, I’m in the Porsche red line
Drive that motherfucker like I’m tryna beat the deadline
Holla at the boy bitch, yes I’m the boy bitch!
I’m fly and ya boy friends a ostrich
How much you cost bitch?
See I will buy you then and then sell you back like an auction
Okay?
I am affiliated with DJ Drama and this Just Blaze track has just met Jeffery Dahmer
I am a Bengal on the beat like Carson Palmer
And them niggas couldn’t see me with panorama haa
Niggas soft as a can of flowers
And soft as a can of tuna
Your fucking with a piranha
The ballin’ is no illusion
Paper tall as a tower
I’m paid ho
I could change ya life all in an hour
I promise I see the city skyline from my shower
I’m feeling like a gun with a bag of gun powder
Pow Pow I’m higher than Mister Charles
Fresh from the bottom of the ant pile
Weezy
Uh..
Uh huh
Ya

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
My grill is gangsta, my aim is money
The championship is beautiful but the game is ugly
They say “Feed the hungry” but these bitches is greedy
But I am awfully gifted I am simply strategic
It’s, come to my room I make her feel like it’s Egypt
And she leave out that room feeling like a paraplegic ha
My fuck game is my capital feature
I stuff her ass up like a pair of new sneakers
Back to the subject at hand
Baby, I’m a wealthy ass young black man
Flow more rare than finding black sand
And I just want some brain like a fucking cat scan
I just want some paper like a fucking trash can
Life is a maze, so hows it hanging pac man
I seem to amaze, as well as advance
I’m so far ahead I gotta save the last dance

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Get it strait like pans as I enhance
M.O.B I’m all about my chips like Lance hehe
I be with animals, with animal tactics
I swear I’m backed up like New York traffic ha
You dumb fucks, you're nothin’ but lunch ducks
Big nuts here swinging like nunchucks
Hollygrove I’m claiming it like insurance
I been on the grind nigga you are just a tourist
Flowers for the dead, say hello to the florist
Fuck with me wrong, bet I rush ya like Borris
Now they tryna kick it but I ain’t Chuck Norris
I kick it with lil flu and he rollin’ up a forest
Can’t be compared no, I’m not a thesaurus
Can’t be banned I’m sorry Miss. Delores
Fuck Wendy Williams the bitch look like a dude
Her body look chewed and her hair looks glued
But let me get back to my food
Eat the track up and leave the mic barbecued
Why in 30 lives would you ever war with I
I’m just getting high, thinking bout Tha Carter V
My homie’s straight, my mama good, and my daughter's fine
And everyday I pray and thank the great Lord of mine
Weezy Baby you're looking at greatness
Gangsta Grillz no braces bitch
Bitch
Its yoooouuuung Khalifa man
Oh x 7

[Hook]
Alot of y'all thinkin its yo time but I'll tell you it's Taylor Gang season

And my city got faith in me cause I give 'em someone to believe in
They tell me I'm a hero
A young mother fuckin hero

[Verse]
The best when I'm flowin', get goin', no way I can stop
Superhuman strength but don't show it so call me Hancock
Benny off of Sandlot, I pick on the Beast
Represent my city streets when I shit all over beats
Young Pete Park how I stick to a track, man
The way I make hits you should call me the Batman
I'm more like a Jetson cause nigga I'm spacely
I'm eatin' like Pac-Man you playin' like Jackson
A role model but gotta keep me some weeds whirled
Ridin' with a superhero dime I call her G girl
Know I'm a star my car's parked out of the world
And my diamonds kind of remind lil mama of sea world
Homie you niggas got zero
They say they need someone to come and save the game and I'ma motherfuckin' (hero)
A young mother fuckin' (hero)
No cape, I'm tatted up to my face
I know more than half of you niggas fake
Like the mystery men roll a swisher sweet then
I gets ill T. Milli tell 'em I'm bad news
I straight run this shit, punisher, Frank Castle
I'm Tony without the iron suit
I put that mother fucker on ain't no tellin' where I'm goin'
Got my pedal to the floor, you'll never be in my lane
Can't remember my name they notice me from my chain, lets go
I'm Young Wizzle, I'ma keep this thing poppin'
This year my CD gone be the sickest thing droppin'
Makin' money off of rap you niggas need options
The way I get that green they say I be green goblin
I became boss man, y'all remain lame now I'm somewhere gettin' tan smokin' swisher sweets, coughin'
Fresh like a body, yeah a body in a coffin
Might as well take you back to '97 I'm the bomb like bl-ow

Let's get drunk, forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me

We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah

[Verse 2: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Won't you meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece, deserve Louis one three
One fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checking your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now were both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing it so he can make it clear

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank, woah, oh-ooh, woah
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?

We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Let's get gone, walk it out

Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yourself
Let's get gone, walk it out
Now walk it out think about it, oh snap
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yourself

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me

We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh, woah

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condominiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin' through
I got niggas who pump on yo' block and in your spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin' you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting, fronting in eclipsesis

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers, Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas' names on it
Often I bug, then bust off on a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a TEC at Mason, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

[Chorus: Styles P & DMX]
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas with a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real
You can feel 'em in your vein
Like Ramello's pops from Sugar Hill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom, you'll see beg niggas' pardon
Whatever, we can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real, B
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty

[Verse 4: Styles P]
I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official LOX family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you're smartest, and retaliate the hardest
Regardless, if you're a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffing Nestle
And y'all niggas done starting something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'ma make salat 'til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

[Chorus: Styles P & DMX]
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

[Verse 5: DMX]
Don't come at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck whatchu heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so give me 3 feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than 3 deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon' tell your mother, her baby's under a cover
In the morgue, stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs?
Another hardheaded nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
(What's that?) Surgery with the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
'Cause, like I said before, ain't nothing going down until I eat
Muh'fuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, undressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with muhfuckers on all levels, what I'm dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine, your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money, 'cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime, black Gotti, I stack bodies with the black shottie
Bitch-ass niggas that act snotty
Get it

[Outro: Interviewer & DMX]
These niggas is for real
These niggas ain't playing
This ain't no fucking game
She think we playing?
Ruff Ryders
Grr

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast (Yes indeed)
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast (Yes indeed)

[Verse 1]
Stand clear, Don man'll talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out, we run New York
Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‘cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
‘Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
‘Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 2]
Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, "What you're doing?"
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Break]
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 3]
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wan' check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great—when it's gonna stop?!

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Break]
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed
Yes indeed

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Intro: 2Pac]
Live back at 'cha Westside baaaaby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard "All Eyez on Me," niggas know what time it is
(Makaveli the Don) 'Pac do it like that
Rhymin and stealin, selling five million
(Outlaw.. ninety-nine)
Fresh out on bail, niggas still can't see me
(Napoleon, E.D.I, Young Noble, Fatal Hussein)
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin plan, and a new mission
(Makaveli the Don, Greg Nice, Outlaw - Outlaw)
Competition, so they say, these niggas is gay
(Outlaw - Outlaw)
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walking and rapping
Heard of some niggas on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me
(Throw ya hands up, hands up)
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my click
(Throw ya motherfuckin hands up)

[Chorus: 2Pac + Outlawz]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fucking mo', exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin' my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin'
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we sheddin' tattoo tears

[Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (bi-tch); now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears (Thugged out baby!)

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? Huh? What?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinking made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinking caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin' tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin' tattoed tears

[Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 4: Kadafi]
Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style

[Verse 5: Kastro]
Yo I been losin' sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowing now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin' and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talking to the heavens
Walking thru the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, starting with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nothing to lose, but my brain
I'mma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, crying these tattooed tears (haha)
Come on...

[Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble]
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears (Oh my)
And I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Haha)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears (Baby)
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I been, handlin' stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin' tattooed tears

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
And they say they ballin', but I do it how the pro's do
Where we goin' next week I let my hoes choose
No socks in my boat shoes
Guess a nigga eatin' good like Whole Foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ridin' with me, so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high, roll the weed up like I'm supposed to
And now I'm into big things
Own the building, you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a bitch give me brain call it homework
Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Slow money just as bad as gettin' no money
But learn to get good show money, that's your money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me
Self made nigga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy what's been done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake
I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like who is this?
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit
So you wrote your own check off a ho ass
Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back
Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her
We was sneakin' in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it
My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'
We plotted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin'
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
TwitPicin' when we get it and they mad at us, fuck them niggas

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
And if the kids tryna be like me
They probably smokin' by the O
Oh, that ain't my fault though

[Intro: Short Dawg]
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Deezle on the beat and let me do my thang
Thinkin' 'bout a certain, certain somebody
That perfect somebody, sexy purple body
She got service road curves, and highway eyes
The road to her soul, just follow the road signs
And holla if you hear me, I love it when she's near me
I hate when she's away, and Satan'll see the day
That Hell freeze over before I let her go
And let one of you bitch niggas get her, no, no, no
You don't know how to treat her
You don't know that I need her, hey
Do you know that I need ya?
'Cause baby, right now
It feel like the whole world is against me
Ever since the death of Pimp C
But me, I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
I'm up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
And you sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
You sit on 24's, I sip on 24's
Drop a four in a 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in a 20 ounce and call it 24's
I'm riding out, leaning, never nodding out
My girl tripping, damn I gotta hear my momma mouth
My homeboys say I should slow down a little
But that shit I'm on make me slow down a lot
You bottle pop, I buy a bottled pop
Drop some syrup in it, get out my Waffle House
I live in Wayne's World, represent our South
And this how we do it, do it in our South
One more ounce'd make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me and my drank
Will somebody please, please double cup me?
And everybody please, please don't judge me
Will somebody please, please double cup me?
And everybody please, please don't judge me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank (Yeah) me-me-me and my drank

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Now for all y'all who ain't heard of him
Mr. M-O-E, the Barre Baby
Was a Southside living legend
Of 3rd Ward, bone hard, street veteran
And it all started in '93
High school, he was a fool, he was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rollin' in foreign cars through the streets of 3rd Ward
It was all momma leave 'em with, a trace of Mo-E
And promethazine, now he the codeine fiend
And his team was the coldest, every day they rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick cause that's that Screwed Up Clique
The Barre Baby, the Barre Baby
Barre Baby, yeah
I sip that Big Moe, I drink that Pimp C
Rest in peace Big Moe, rest in peace Pimp C
I sip that Big Moe, I drink that Pimp C
Rest in peace Big Moe, rest in peace Pimp C
And fuck what they say
Mr. DJ Screw, I'ma do this for you

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Short Dawg]
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank (Yeah, yeah)
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
I usually don't do this but, uh...

[Verse 3: Short Dawg]
Yeah, T you gotta feel me
Sippin' on some drank the color purple like Celie
Really, they say I should chill before it kills me
But so will a car crash or a nine milli (That's true)
And I ain't even mention cigarettes or airplanes
So grab a Sprite, here's a pint we can share, Wayne
Yeah mayne, tastes so sweet
And I ain't gonna have a seat cause I don't wanna fall asleep
So just pour it in my drink and I'ma sip until I lean hard
Drank got me moving slower than a retard
So press record, and hear these hot raps (You know I got 'em)
I'm in the booth, cup on me like a jock-strap (I ain't lying)
And I will not nap until the bottle's empty
Then I pour a little more for Pat, Screw and Pimp C (Rest in peace)
And I would stop but believe that I can't
So 'til Short is gone, it's just me and my drank, my drank

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank
Up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me and my drank
Up-up-up in the studio, me and my drank
Me and my drank, me-me-me and my drank

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Short Dawg]
Me and my drank
Up in the studio, someone pour another four
Oh, oh, yeah
I told the bitch one more ounce will make me feel so great
Wait, now I can't feel my face
Will somebody please, please double cup me?
And tell the world please, please don't judge me
Will somebody please, please double cup me?
And everybody please, please don't judge me
You sit on 24's, we sip on 24's
You sit on 24's, we, we, we
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Drop a four in the 20 ounce and call it 24's
Yeah, I'm in the lab, no pad, no pen
Just a styrofoam cup I can pour a four in

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
This is the finish my friend, this is the end
It's a revolution it's a civilian revenge
There's no need to move or adjust your television
Whenever an era dies, another era begins
These American fights, these American wars
These American stripes, these American stars
But these American cages have American bars
We hunger for truth so we headed for y'all
Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling
Limits are fading, the normal is boring
Looking at time move progressively forward
Looking the days just vanish before me
You wanted a Benz but you couldn't afford it
Now you would kill to put your foot in a Taurus
It's a different of madness and never look backwards
But this is the crisis, prepare for disaster

[Hook]
Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
New York

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Breaker breaker 9 breaker breaker 1 9
Could you please get a operator on the phone line
This is not a riot it's way much more than that
These people are dying we are under attack
Wait let me call you back, let me get my stack
Cause we ain't taking shit so therefore we'll fight them back
We ain't waiting on the line for a 9-1-1-9-9
Whatever man I ain't got time for all this nonsense
Enemy responses ain't a dial tone in our home on the continent
Got me in these bandages this struggle is abundant
Man I swear they sleeping, they unconscious or they slumbering
So we break the peace to get a piece of what we wanted
Act like we new to this like we run this shit
Let them know we run this shit
And let them know just how you feel the way your country is
Now look how beautiful destruction is
Bang

[Hook]
Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York New York
New York

He don't gotta know where
Does he touch you here like this, this, this, this?
Let me take the friction from your lips (Ooh woah)

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And I'ma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I got everything you want with me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor
Doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby, leave them high-heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're looking down at me
I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn, shawty
Watch me knock your boots off

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And I'ma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'm gon' give you girl, what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want

If you don't like it, nigga, fuck you with a AIDS dick
I hope you die 30 times, nigga, murder moms
No fast talk, I'm on that syrup, I'm on that turtle-time
If Killa say the nigga dead, then a nigga dead
If Stunna say the nigga dead, then a nigga dead
VIP, we be then niggas banging in the red
Don't drink Cristal no more, just pour it on white bitches' heads
This ain't no Tommy Hilfiger, this that Polo, ho
We are the biggest group alive to get that solo dough
And we gon' get that dough until they say there's no more dough
I smoke a ounce, I got that bounce, I got that pogo flow
Just shot a video with R-uh Kelly, but no homo, though
Really didn't wan' do it, but I fuck with T.S. and Fat Joe-Joe though
I am a robot, and this robot is on overload
And bitch, I always will be hot like I'm an overcoat

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Um... Dollar after dollar, holler at your guala
I'm rolling like the Stones, I need a water bottle
And if you need a pill, T-Streets and Carter got 'em
Supply the whole party, we got the party popping
We in New Orleans popping, we way in Harlem popping
In California popping
Them Ed Hardy-rocking skinny whores with all them problems
Bitch, you can eat these pills and chill and tell me all about 'em, shit...
Hold up, my heart is knocking, don't worry. water stops it
Hold up, your mouth is dry, don't worry, water mops it
I got a great idea: We should have sex
Bitch, I'm like Dante Hall: I just throw up the X
My dick be still hard, I be so up for next
That's when you slip up and fuck around, and fuck your ex
That be that bullshit, but it's the fucking best!
I get her to pop a pill, and come and fuck the set
And I fucking rep!

[Hook: Cam'ron sample]

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled, & Ludacris]
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it, ugh
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevys

And everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood (Miami-Dade County, 305)
Them boys will put you down on yo knees

(Woop, woop!) That’s the sound of the police in my hood
Stop playin' wit em! Luda!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Everybody on the corner with the work
Slangin' and bangin' in front of that liquor store (Oh!)
Blowin' money 'cause I live life fast
With this bottle full of 'gnac, I'ma sip this slow (Oh!)
Singles double when triple-beams take over
Now holler 'cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (Woo!)
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color, catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin' scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures (Woo!)
Cock my .40 Glock and my partner just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin' they don't keep no cash in they register
(Hurry up and buy!)
We run from red and blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen! (Woo!)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Hey! Teddy Pain (Teddy Pain) Bad man (Bad man)
Mix shots, boom-(boom)-boom-(boom)-boom-(bang)!
Man, we the best, never the less, you know we get it hot
Fire (flame, flame), fire—fire (flame)
Put me on the track and I'ma really let a motherfucker feel it
When I do it, how I do it, what I do (Do)
If a nigga really wanna test (Come and test)
You can bet that I'ma eat 'em all day (Fuck food!)

Talla-home Florida president ('Sent)
Me and DJ Khaled got these haters lookin' hesitant, yeah (Oww)
So keep all that wackness out my ear
(Boop, boop!) That’s the sound of your career in my hood—

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats
'Cause it's whoop-ass season

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
(Coming to a hood near you!)
Everybody know what happen
When you see me comin' (Back up!)
I be hurdling and got you regurgitating
And murdering everything (Gunshots!)
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop

You can Google it and you can search it (Oooooh!)
On how a nigga come and unlock it
Impossible for you to stop it (Damn!)
(More fire 'pon di place!) Now go and heed the villain
You're like, "He's injured" and prob'ly need a medical situation
Because the way I'm fuckin' everything up 'til the people dead

And, you don't wanna come behind me with it, bro! (Hunh!)

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 4: Twista & Mavado]
Welcome to my hood
Where board members and faculty backin' me
If you ever try attackin' me
That could be when I eat 'em, especially when I beat 'em
When they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I'm an anomaly to 'em, put 'em on crutches
With succulent verses, I'm just the one that's kicking the ruckus
Munch as I smoke a Dutchess, and model bitches that cut us
And motherfuckers that love us, and enemies wanna touch us
I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin (Haha, what!)
Then the gangstas are resting up forever (Ah...)
See a silent four-, put it on the fin (What!)
Then you know to never test him
It'll be a category F5 (Ayyy)
Handle military with automatic weapons, so let's ride (I...)
Love to the Hundreds, and everybody that runnin' them north
And the whole city, and I'm from the westside (Wan', today)

[Verse 5: Mavado]
Welcome to the gully where we no take bad up
Big spliff in ah mi hand (Haha) and Hennessy in ah mi cup
You see the gyaldem we have up is like some angels abduct
Them fat-tongue, grabba, yah hear me? Haha
When you pass the gate, written at the entrance
"Violate: Straight death sentence"
To live, you must be great; to be a snake, no repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 6: DJ Khaled]
Never slippin', I'm ballin', Puff keep on callin'
I don't see none of you pussies (I ain't tryna hear that shit)
Fuck that shit you be talkin'
Rep Miami, the ghettos (Dade County)
Every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles
I'm droppin' one of my targets (Tsssss)
Lord, forgive me for my sins (God, forgive me)
I gave you hits—I gave you "All I Do Is Win" (I won't stop)

Knock-knock, you hear the Glock cock
And that thing pop on that four-four (Brr-r-rat!)
Posted on it, that same block
I'm in the droptop with that bankroll
Young—Young nigga, I'm out here
Can't name a place that I can't go
Ridin' round with 'bout fifty grand
And they wonder, "What do that safe hold?"
Middle finger them Feds
And that's what I pledge—a part of my G code
And it's fuck them prosecutors; hustler, connoisseur
It's We The Best Forever
Make sure you spread the rumor, bitch

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 9: Fat Joe]
Good coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin' left right in front of the Marble precinct
Leave 'em like them Jordans, red-dot, leakin'
I'm fifteen when I first startin' coppin' pies
You 46 just turnin' Blood? Stop it, Five
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin' things
Hoop dreams, dunkin' over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game]
Yo, it’s that black raw, black dawg
Pullin' up on that black Hog
Compton, that's my backyard
That's where I used to get them sacks off
But now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I'm back with Dre again
Aftermath, We The Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em
Detox, RED, that's back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga, I'm so hood even though I'm living good
Niggas still in the VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks, then, it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'Lac
REDRUM if you try it; nigga, it's Westside!
Throw it up! Now!

[Break: T-Pain]

Savin' every dime (Yeah), tryna choke a quarter
And they ain't sellin' crack (Nah), they sellin' coke and water (Woo)
Smokin' or ya snortin' (Ahh), they coppin' all the Jordans (Yeah)
Nothing's more important, steal 'em if you can't afford 'em (Yup)
I'm gettin' to the money (Money), I need another comma
Some of 'em love the drama (Yeah)
More than they love they mama, ugh!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 12: Bun B & Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Welcome to the land of the trill
Well, everybody walkin' with they hand on they steel
And the model is a supply and demand, and at will
You been outta line with the wrong man and get killed
When you damned if you will, damned if you won't
Lot of dudes sayin' that they can, but they don't
And a lot of boys sayin' that they Gs, but they ain't
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, say what you do
'Fore I come around your hood, broad day, with the crew
They got them FNs, ARs and Ks with 'em, too
And they will gladiate all day, what it do! (what it do)
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it
To my Gs on lockdown, acquitted
Stick with it, think I'ma stop reppin' PAT, forget it
RIVERDALE! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Flocka!

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame]
Welcome to Clayton County (Ugh! Ugh!)
My house got surrounded (Ugh! Ugh! Flocka!)
Enemies tryna drown me
But my hood still around me (RIVERDALE!)
Rookie of the year (Yeah!), no Freshmen cover
Shawty 16 years old, with four baby mothers (Flocka!)
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET (Uh-huh)
And since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street (Ugh!)
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV (Flocka!)
Every day is a party on Grove Street

"We The Best Forever"
June 28th
It's gon' be a hot summer

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I do it cause I feel it
Live it like I’m talkin’
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like parkinsons
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan
Thats what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery, Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
It's bringing me back down, he's checking my background
Its ironic what's happening, imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out, dawg, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

[Hook: John Legend]
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed

[Intro: Tyga]
Falling asleep
I'm just writing words
Yeah

[Verse: Tyga]
Unreal to a close eye
Can’t feel but you heard that I’m close by
It’s more vivid, the image embedded in my mind
I look around and rarely I see a fake smile
No time when the tick is down
My Rolex dial don’t mean shit now, it’s just another pay cut
My mind made up, unnecessary lay-ups
You can still win, ain't got a rich or star player
Fuck a hater, still remain a, self made nigga
Live bigger, credit cards, no limits
I dropped twenty on the luggage, took ten minutes
I don’t shop online, those are all gimmicks
Only make moves when your heart's in it
B.I.G said it, so I entertain like Cedric
Standin' on the trunk rooftop, view the city
Batman spotlight, gotta save you bitches
Joke's on you, Jack
Who the fuck you gon' call when your shit towed, by the repo?
Can’t tell your girl, so she the centerfold
Now you gettin' played like Casios
Uh, casino’s, C-notes and chips like Frito’s
Got a free coat when Costa Rico
Most hoes only know two words
Like, "Gimme those", still buy 'em though
Currently ballin’ so I gotta let ya know
Flash through the tint, roll the window, tilt the brim
What the fuck I did? "Lemme see your registration
I'ma keep it real kid, I’m just hatin"
Ain’t a opportunity I ain’t take close chase
City national bank evolve into shape
Of a dollar then I, duplicate
Motherfucker don’t believe, let me, demonstrate
I dreamed a motherfucker try to kill me in my sleep
What's the point of steak when niggas want beef?
Diss me cause they hungry
Made a meal that you couldn’t eat
You fuckin' snakes in a rat race, two-face bitches
That’s why I don’t fuck with none of y'all niggas
Cause soon as y'all fell, well, you fell with 'em
It's like puttin '87 in a Bentley, nigga don’t tempt me

[Hook: Tyga & Marsha Ambrosius]
Everything ain't everything (Everything ain't everything)
Shit ain't always what it seems (What it seems)
I put that on everything (Everything, yeah)
No sleep, having light dreams (Light dreams)
What I see is what I can't reach (Ay)
I put that on everything (Everything)
Goin crazy, I might be (Might be)
No sleep, having light dreams (Light dreams, light dreams)
I dream everything ain't everything (Everything)
Shit ain't always what it seems (What it seems)
I put that on everything (Everything)
No sleep, having light dreams (Light dreams)
What I see is what I can't reach
I put that on everything (Put it on everything)
Goin crazy, I might be (Might be)
No sleep, having light dreams (Light dreams)
I dream

[Outro: Marsha Ambrosius]
Light dreams
Light dreams, light dreams
Light dreams, light dreams
Light dreams, light dreams
Light dreams, light dreams
Light dreams, light dreams

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you're Goddamn right, I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, "My pussy does it stink
He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he? Still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And there's no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone, is he?"
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself "when's the next time he's gonna punch me?"
I told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
And once she does, she'll be stuffed up in a trunk
Crunchy, scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'ma get caught and sent up the river
I shiver when I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep?
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together when we slept together everything
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
She'd go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for fifty-thousand dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream and holla
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we'd just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh! She's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, till my shrink told me this

[Hook: Paul Simon]
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

[Hook]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah)
Money I got, money is got (Ohhh!)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
Money I got, money is got (Ohhh!)
Luda!

[Verse]
Put the needle on the record, and a needle in your veins
If Luda's on your record, it will never be the same
'Cause Luda makes hits, other rappers make claims
I cut the braids off, but ain't a damn thang change
Lets get one thang clear, the South's right here
Still got the Grammy for the album of the year
12 mil sold still flying on lears
Over 30 million dollars in the past three years
'Cause I gets money, money I got
The first in the hood with the bentley drop top
The Jacob goes tick, Audemars go tock
Fruity Pebble diamonds, they say I'm on rocks!
I get that gua-po-le, own twelve properties
Only game I play: real life Monopoly, properly
And ain't no need for apologies, sorry is as sorry does
Follow me, 'cause...

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
These guys aren't tough-n-stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But the chips are down, cause I put them there
And I got a hot chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only gold that I have is my Emmy bitch
Yes and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it
See the other side of it
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could I ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And I go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me cause I had to, now a nigga like to
Cause I get cheese like the mice do
I'm a work of art, crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stopped sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo
Sleeping on a cow pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, I'mma ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush
I really think I'd like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands

[Verse 2]
This is all fun, yeah my work is vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free, download it
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick, indie black girl, double stuffed Oreo
Make a shit rapper pissed off like a urinal
You cannot see me, I can change your perspective
Sick boy clique, that's an animal collective
Fuckin' withcha raw, like I don't need protection
I am just a rapper, I'm in search a perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy-tale, I earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper better learn sign language
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight, Teddy Ruxpin
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Have a nigga have a hit and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, I'mma change it all up
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird Soufflé, yeah the noise makes me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shotgun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch and it's back to the future
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to
Cause they used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga motherfucker turn your eyes on
I am so different y'all don't even know the half of
I do not talk, motherfucker I'm a Rapper!

[Intro]
Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

[Verse 1: MCA]
All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

[Verse 2: Mike D]
Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

[Verse 3: Ad Rock]
Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

[Verse 4: Mike D]
I said, "Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission"
He said, "Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician"
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

[Verse 5: Ad Rock]
Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer

[Verse 6: MCA]
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

[Verse 7: Ad Rock]
Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, "Ad-Rock, you rock so well"
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale

[Verse 8: MCA]
Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Now-
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say "those were the days"

[Chorus]
Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out

[Intro]
Random disclaimer!
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fucking fiction
If anything happens, don't fucking blame me
White America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like? Saying I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash' black hoodies, try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring

[Pre-Chorus]
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

Odd Future, Wolf Gang
We came together cause
We ain't have nobody else

You just might be one of us
Are you?

[Verse 2]
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rockstar
Rebel and defiance makes my motherfucking cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up? Fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fucking money (hey mom)
I ain't got no motherfucking daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come, that faggot still ain't bought me anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

[Post-Chorus 2]
(Left, right, left, right)
They want us to go to they schools and
Be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit
Fuck that

'Cause at the end
Who's there? You

[Chorus]
Fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

Stand for what the fuck you believe in, and don't let nobody tell you can't do what the fuck you want
I'm a fucking unicorn
And fuck anybody, who say I'm not
Wolf Gang

[Bridge]
Fuck your traditions, (and) fuck your positions (and)

[Outro: Dr. TC & Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta let these shits go, man. It's not making sense to you right now, but... all these little dreams you got, they're not shit. All this rebellion, all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit... getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it. Growing up, your dreams are getting bigger. You gotta look at reality, understand that shit, so you don't get caught. I'm just being real
Nigga, fuck you
I'm just trying to help you, man, trust me
Look, I mature day after day, nigga, you don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist
Whatever

[Intro]
Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It gets lonely in this business, need a homie who's the realest
Someone who wants to find out all that I have to give
Who can bring me what is missing, when I talk, she wanna listen
Sitting patient, steady waiting for the day when I can face it

[Pre-Chorus]
The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more
Is it you? You my Bonnie
Say that I, I found the one
I ain't gonna rest 'til I know for sure, so

[Chorus]
Baby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need
I need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "That's my baby", so if you need me say "You're my baby"

[Verse 2]
I'm a good man, who ain't got a lot to ask, just looking for something I can build on
I'm a young man, with a whole lotta cash, just looking for a lady I can spend on
So all the young ladies in every little city when I come to your town, let me know that you down
Sitting patient, steady waiting for the day when I can face it

[Pre-Chorus]
The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more
Is it you? You my Bonnie

[Bridge]

But I know that, that I'm your man and you are my girl
And if I ever meet ya, I'ma give ya the world, oh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
"You're my baby"
Yeah, huh, yeah

[Juelz:]
Money over bitches thats the motto I follow
Take that to the grave I'll swallow 8 hollows
For the day I letta bitch stop me from gettin paid
No way I get head get laid get gone on em
Dont be mad I left 100 at the door for you
Baby dont spend it all at once its just a thought for you
Ain't that a dog for ya, some chicks like flees, you gotta use ya paws to get em off of ya
And in the streets you can't get caught trippin, caught slippin, gotta hustle gotta get in were you fit in
Hope you know how to make a dollar quicker then you spend it
Cuz there's bills comin in every second, every minute
And its coke on the dishes is you flippin or you sniffin
Put the coke in the water shit its kinda like fishin
No rod just a spoon I throw it and start mixing
Like that and like this and like that and a
Like this and like that you got crack voila
And since the towers fell niggas been mad as hell
Its been a drought out ain't enough crack to sell
But the world keep spinnin like a carousel
Gotta get the cash, get the cream and the caramel
On top gotta be on top strawberries whip cream on top
Get popped fuckin wit my m.o.n.e.y
Guys plot thats why I got the nina
Chop chop man that choppa lean ya
The blocks hot like its got a fever
Cops cops nuthin but cops I see ya peekaboo
They every where im never scared I hustle anyway
Everyday customers, send em here
And you know I give em that shit thats gon get em back coke crack sugar snaps
Or should I say sugar snacks
Coke in da sugar jar, cookie jar crib, car, a sugar shack
And the bitches sleep naked in the sugar shack
Mind on my money no lookin back

[Lil wayne:]
I pop up in the middle of the hot block
Make the drop top play hopscotch on them hoes
Lil wayne, right from Kims corner store
Choppa wake a niggas ass up like tha mornin show
Put me in the game and I see em callin audibles
Hearts beatin fast betta work on ya cardio
How you want video, audio, part of yo body get mailed to ya gal, eww
Pussy ass nigga die slow dont yell
I put it on the streets and I bet its gone sell
Whats under that floor well it sure isnt nails
Just how I make money cracker I'mma make bail
Im a Libra and my sign is a scale
If it dont measure up then a nigga gettin killed
The smaller the car the bigger them wheels
And a nigga so hot that I give a bitch chills
And if she like coke then I give the bitch hills
No stilettos or pumps 21 bumps
21 Jump street if anyone jumps and once you hit the ground thats when everyone stomps
Perrier Jouet everyones drunk so its 21 Jump Street if anyone jumps
The milli goes pow and the semi goes pap
A itty bitty bullet make a skinny nigga fat
Hard body baby knockin any nigga back
And its money ova bitches not a penny ho scat
An it'll be like that 'til that line go flat
But in da mean time I'm in that bent no hat, thats no top if you didn't know that
On them chrome Sean Johns with them guts so black
In fact yall can leave that be bitch im ballin like I got scouts checkin for me yeah
Im on third base comin' home with the paper
I got 100 pounds comin' home from Jamaica
I can't think and my sprite so pink
And I might be floatin but I will not sink Weezy

[Verse 1]
And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I’m drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured
Them bitches gonna ride with who they think’s a winner
And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture
Oh, I'm smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred
On a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I tell them pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business, don’t play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
'Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I’m gone, gone, gone
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I’ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I’m making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it’s a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No NBA, they say I’m a baller
Live for today, stunt like my father

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 1: Billy Scafuri]
One, two, three, check it out
On the road to sandwiches and chicken wings
Fat people do phat things
Using salt and pepper for their seasonings
Fat people do phat things
Check it out
It's B to the I to the double L-Y
My friends all know I'm not an ordinary guy
I like little things, like chicken wings
BBQ sauce, honey mustard, onion rings
And when my cell phone rings it goes jingle-jing
I say hello, I say hello, I say who this be?
They say it's Fancy Ned, I got a fancy head
I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
The wait is over, shut up, bend over
I hang with monsters, I chill with Grover
The boy Ebola, my boy fat too
And my girl so fat that they call her Oprah
I got that green like a bowl of okra
Loose change so fat can't fit my sofa
I head to the bank, call the shit my grocer
It's Sex in the City, get the fat mimosa
Me and B, we fat boys, hang with fat girls
Driving fat toys, fuck Dan Aykroyd
I'm live on a Saturday night
I got two fat girls, I'm doing it right
Like my name John Goodman
I got the fat crib so I'm doing real good, man
And I'm up to no good, man
This is how I get fat, call the shit cooking

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things

[Verse 3: Billy Scafuri]
I tip waitresses, I tip scales
My style is kind of fat like an Orca whale
I'm sipping whole milk as I stare
Thinking I can be your Oprah, you can be my Gayle
Cause I am a fat boy, never been to Bally's
Married to this fat life, call me Kirstie Alley
Married to the snack life, counting every calorie
Might just open up a fat boy art gallery

[Verse 4: Childish Gambino & Billy Scafuri]
What else you do, B?
I'll make it easy
What else you do, B?
For girls to squeeze me
I'm phat but my numbers run
Listen, son, I'mma show them how it's done
When my swagger weighs a ton
Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun

[Verse 5: Childish Gambino]
I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers
Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher
In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you
Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out "nothing"
But they all know it's something
You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin?
But better and better like Benjamin Button

[Verse 6: Billy Scafuri & Childish Gambino]
I hang out with Chester Cheeto
Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito
Hotter than the peppers in your burrito
Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean
Yeah, I know what you mean, homegirl mistaken
She think Gambino won't bring home bacon
Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes
Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes
They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus
The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas
I know you want it, don't get me started
They see Gambino and they act retarded

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things
Fat people do fat things

[Outro: Billy Scafuri]
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks coming out of packs
Guaranteed to put a little fat on your back
Eat snacks

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh

[Verse: J. Cole]
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that through the body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that

And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea

Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy"

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
.44 bulldog, my motherfuckin' pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker, "Fetch"
I'm fuckin' her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth, and ass, call that bitch triple-threat
When I was in jail, she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Chorus: Rick Ross + Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car

Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big black nigga in a icy watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch, I got a Nike shop
Count the profits, you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans, kick 'em off, they might be hot, swish
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch (Boss)
In the red 911 looking devilish (Haha)
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof 'til he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before (Yeah)
Baby, I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago

[Chorus: Rick Ross + Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Talk stupid, get ya head popped

My first home invasion, papi gave me forty bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape (Yeah)

If you get in trouble, that just mean you fuckin' up (NIgga)
It's a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up (Yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 1]
I said they actin' like they better, but they never been the shit
Hows it feel to have a hundred thousand people on ya dick?
Well, it feels good, homie, you should probably try it
If you never rocked a sold out show, then keep quiet
I gets busy on a track, workin' double time
Tryna find a foreign pussy just to put my tongue inside
I be on the top of the charts, you just an underline
Tearin' through the streets, all these hatin' suckers run inside
Furious, fool probably wanna come and stomp me out
Mad they got a girl, and I'm all that bitch talks about
Been gettin' money since I walked around my father's house
The dads be cop and search when I come and take they daughters out
Paper come in large amounts, I'm eatin' like I should
Surf and turf shit, sink my teeth in somethin' good
They mad I ain't hood, nah, I came to party hard
You grillin' at me, but I smile back, bitch, hardy-har

[Chorus]
Come on down, grab your girl, maybe spin her around
Ain't no other motherfucker gettin' the people this wild
What you want? Some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a little futuristic funk
We those kids gettin' cheese, on some Cheetos shit
Just fuckin' for the night, then we leave that bitch
So what you want? Some futuristic funk
Tell me what you want, a little futuristic funk (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
So you probably heard I rap a ton, havin' fun
Never have I had a gun
Vomit when I spit like I devoured somethin' bad for lunch
Tryna figure out the way to get me rich, I have a hunch
Like Velma up in Scooby-Doo, confusin' like a Rubix Cube
Usually don't do this, I be stupid, just a nuisance
All you seem to hear about, I'm in ya ear; Q-tip
Yeah, that's dude sick, sleeve with a few tricks
Breathe in a huge spliff, weed come in two zips
You light it, then I burn it, like a furnace when the herb hits
Like it 'cause I earn it, smokin' good veggie turnips
Bitch, I'm fallin' from the sky like bird shit
Makin' movies everywhere I go, call me Ernest

[Chorus]
Come on down, grab your girl, maybe spin her around
Ain't no other motherfucker gettin' the people this wild
What you want? Some futuristic funk

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
First rule, never let 'em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest (To the fullest)
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel, then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great, don't need silicone to build it, or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

[Post-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Uh, I ain't never been cheap

Never made varsity, but I fucking ball...

I got my cup filled, bitches all around me, on some bachelor shit
Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world, I use my atlas, make a map of it
Globe trotter, ho hopper, superstar, asterisk
People always wonder, so they ask us who we are (Are)
Rollin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar (Bar)
Wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomorrow
See the money, bitches, bubbly, designer clothes, foreign cars
But I (I,) ain't never gonna change, different city every day
You hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, and don't know shit about the game
'Til I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pourin' out champagne
Livin' life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some "I don't give a fuck" shit
Still with my homies I came up with
So celebrate the fact that we young, rich, and famous

[Chorus]
I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

[Verse 2]
Hey, go Europe to Japan, then Mexico to France
Bitches of every nationality, get up and dance
So, let me see your hands please
We makin' noise like a stampede
So much smoke up in this bitch, you can't breathe
Somewhere where it's sandy, Cali or Miami
This the only way to do, and never made a plan B
Can't we get it how we live?
Tonight ain't the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls comin' all dressed up, then they takin' off their clothes (Clothes)
You know your man a amateur, come party with some pros (Pros)
You need somethin' new, I know your life is gettin' old (Old)
But we ain't gettin' younger, so tonight's the night to go (Go)
So (So,) crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like your cash right
This is fast life, don't you worry, baby, we ain't here to slow it down
Tonight we goin' crazy, and tomorrow you can hold me down

[Chorus]
I got my cup filled up (Filled up)
We came to have a good time, so turn my music high
We gon' tear this place up (Place up)
Warn the neighbors it's a party, so go tell everybody (Uh)
We party all around the world, we party all around the world
We party all around the world, we party all around the world

[Outro]
Let's go around the world (Hey), around the world
Around the whole wide world (And it's the best day ever)
The whole wide world, go around the world, around the world
Around the whole wide world, the whole world
Around the world, around the whole wide world
Whole wide world, the whole wide world, the whole wide world
Around the whole wide world, the world
Yeah

[Verse 1]
What?
What?!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bad bowls
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?

[Chorus]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Verse 2]
Look
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'mma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Weezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me unattatched without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
Who? Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga

[Chorus]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die

[Verse 3]
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Weezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who want this Weezy, nigga? Who want this Weezy, nigga?
Weezy, nigga; Lil Weezy, nigga

[Chorus]
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

[Outro]
It's Weezy, nigga - Lil Weezy, nigga
Don't tangle it, nigga
It's time to step down, ya heards me

[Hook]
Pillmatic
Three xanees down
I'm pounding honey grounds
I'm pillmatic
The oxycontin got my stomach rotting
Pillmatic
I swear to God I'm not an addict
But I'm still at it, dag nabbit I'm pillmatic

[Verse 1]
Thinking back on when it all started
I found pink hearts in mommy's little pocket book
And took 'em
Popping when she wasn't looking
I guess it runs in the family
I'm liable to eat any pill you randomly hand me
Save the greenery
I'm looking for them labels reading
May cause drowsiness be careful when operating machinery
Beautiful pharmaceuticals
Residue in my cuticles
Sniffing them when its suitable
Wishing they made 'em chewable

[Verse 2]
Catch me in the source with five pills next to my name
Like fuck five mics I want five vic fame
If killing pain is the name of the game
Then I'm your number one draft pick
Dash quick to the closest medicine cabinet
Kill the whole bottle
Never played the role model position
I'm just living
So take 2 of these and call me in the morning
I'ma take 4 and finish this 40 cuz life's boring

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Keep the hydro unless it's codone behind it
Never have to roam far from home to find it
Writing fake scripts like my doctor signed it
Till I spelled his last name wrong
This ain't a song for the kids like the last album
Put em to bed go ahead and turn the valium up
A couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts
The doctor says slow down maybe later buts
40 milligrams, a 40 and im faded
This world is crazy so I stay medicated
Percaset, adavan, and colonapen
When my social lights are out
They turn them on again
I need em till I'm bored again
Oxycontin on juice on gin
Equals projectile wild style burner on a porcelain

[Hook]

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & (Gucci Mane)]
(I'm back up in these streets, nigga, you know what the fuck it is)
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
I'm tatted up, dreads shaking, you know what the fuck it is
Waka Flocka Flame one hood ass nigga
You know, you know, you know, you know what it is
'Cause Gucci Mane Laflare one hood ass nigga
(Gucci, Gucci, Mane, nigga), Waka Flocka Flame, nigga
(Don't act like you don't know my mothafuckin' name, nigga)

[Verse One: Gucci Mane]
My swag sick, so I sneeze on a ho
I'm a Rich Boy, I might throw some Ds on a ho
Never seen one of these, I'm not one of them wannabes
This ain't where you wanna be, then she can leave, beat your feet
On every beat I go honey-baked ham, I'm a beast
If it's beef, leave you shiftless, laying on the street
Is it hot in this mothafuckin' booth or is it me?
Me and Jazze Pha go way back like Jazz and T
Smoking weed in a leaf, bitches sweat me like I'm Keith
There's a very strong smell coming out the VIP
I'ma do it for the hood, I'm a product of the streets
We gon' put you up on game, all on the count of three

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Gucci Mane]
Shaking trees(?), she perceives, she might end up in too deep
Give it to her so good, have her coming in her sleep
Take a TwitPic of Gucci dick and send it as a Tweet
Ever since she met me, say them niggas obsolete
I'm buying cars I don't really need, race 'em down the street
Got a Fleet, I can't bring one out, I drive 'em by the three
In a league of my own, he don't own a pair of cleats
I'm a freak on Patron, don't sit your girlfriend next to G
He say he go as hard as me, tell him that I wanna see
Do six months, then get out and spend 2 million in a week
My seed gon' never want for nothing & I put that on my niece
I'm a hustler, guess it runs all through my family tree

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Waka Flocka Flame]
Let me hop back on the set with this brand new single
Million dollar niggas still riding in a Regal
Hood ass young nigga, I got more stripes than a bengal
Shawty pulling slick shit, me and him not equal
Heard that boy not eating so Flocka just might feed you
Two Hundred V my hypeman, now that's a good price, man
Gucci, that's my right hand, two ounces in my Sprite can
AKA the Light Man, they call me Waka Flocka
Told my man Guwop I'ma make him a quarter-mil
Broke before these record deals, I'm just trying to keep it real
These rap niggas flopping, on the low these niggas stopping
Sexual Healing on your girl like I'm Marvin
Mmm, hey, I eat it like dinner
You see this shit I gotta deal with from these beginners?
I ain't circusin' around with these clown-ass niggas
You snappin' at the heels of a world class sprinter
Some may call this bullyin', some may call this bossin'
Check the letter, man, you know I'm All City varsity
Walk up on my field, you will get carried off it
We gon' need a body bag and we gon' need a coffin
Who am I battling? I ain't even exhausted
You can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous
A sea of great whites, you are a dolphin
If I was you, I would be a little more cautious
I'm way too high for you to look at
The future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies
This is target practice but I don't even pull the fucking trigger anymore
Cause it's just a waste of bullets
Come and get these pussies, wipe them off the flo'
I'm guessing they was hoping for some different results
I'm guessing they was guessing cause they wasn't really sure
But fuck it, I guess I'mma have to let these niggas know
So I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick
Got my own city, you can call it Bobtropolis
East side representers reppin' with authority
And I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics
Lookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages
But we already know that, so that is all to get
Check the name tag, you know who the roster is
ATL brand, Hustle H.A.M squad in this bitch
Like I ain't never had a mic
Fresh to death, I see you in the afterlife
I eat bars, eat beats for my appetite
You wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite
What I gotta do to get some solidarity?
Apparently, I need to speak with some more clarity
No luck needed, know no charity
And I'mma grown man, don't need pussy to take care of me
B to the O, I said it once befo'
If I ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote
Already graduated, yeah, you see the cap and robe
But now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope
I'm Bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin
Call me Jack-o-Lantern, I get head like pumpkins
It's nothin', roll up the stuffin'
Put it in the oven, get baked like muffins
If you ain't know, I guess I have to introduce ya
To my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to
Body blow, uppercut, I do more than bruise ya
Keep fuckin' with me and you ain't gon' have no future

[Intro]
You know how we do! Yeah This is what I do young. From my side of the city the dip side
Let's Ride. Yes Sir All my gangsters grab your weapons, punks hit the door. Let's get it
Let's get it yeah uhh

[Verse 1]
I ain't nothin nice
Line em up buckem twice
Lay em' down middle fingers up screamin fuck your life
I roll them 7′s out go head and tuck your dice
Crack your skull never seemed sicker in your fuckin life
See I don't hustle white
Scrawny but my knuckles right
Left hand will leave them shook hooks not the stuff you write
And when your hands ashy only time you've touched the white
Snatch your grind now it my grind you couldn't hustle right
See I'm a hungry dude feelin the pain
Ribs touchin got the thrill in my vains
And you niggas is all in the sunshinen but we still in the rain
And for the team leave you spillin your brains
Cause I ain't feelin you lames
Now clowns should be feelin ashamed
So put the heat to your temple and bang
Me and my soldiers in that that black on black we killin the game
You dudes pumped put a chill in your frame
Let's go man!

[Hook x2]
You should print my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo! Brothers respect mine
The kid that they yapping about they won't stop
You know who rule this shit
The city is mine

[Verse 2]
Ready willing and able, and I've been keeping it stable
Have a leg on the table, since the killing of Abel
Bullets rip through your facial, yeah will give you a face full
I'm into making it painful on demand like your cable
See you dudes is some divas, leave us we move with the heaters
Beef and we shoot through your beaters we turn you dudes to believers
Yeah I'm rocking and ready blown I'm cockin em steady
Popping em 

[?] I'm heavy dropping the top on the chevy
Let em bang through the smith and your brain will be missing
Changing the game it was written changing the lanes when I'm whipping
It's only natural you hate me cause I'm hot
Cause I get love in the streets and I ain't never played the block
You see I do me and you can't never play me cause you not
The flow is Ludacris, coming for that number one spot
So get outta line and get smacked in
I move with the movers
You lose with the losers they smooth when executing manuevers

[Hook]
You should print my information, quote my rhymes
Top 5 dead or alive
Yo! Brothers respect mine
The kid that they yapping about they won't stop
You know who rule this shit
The city is mine
This next song is a, uh, first-hand account

[Verse 1]
High school party, senior year
Boys and girls they're all sipping on beer
I like soda, where’s the soda?
Am I the only fucking person here that likes soda?
I see you from across the crowd
I said the party is bumping and the music is loud
You’re really drunk and you’re looking sad
It’s like a date rape ad
Girl, then we start to dance and
Girl, baby this is romance
Girl, I’m starting to grow down below
Shit, why did I wear sweat pants?
Girl, your body's like what
Conjunction junction, that’s a fine ass but
I’m like a cashew in a lollipop
Just keeping sucking till you get to the nut
And I said let’s rob an Asian kitchen, or stroll down the block
Either way girl, we’re taking a walk/wok
You’re going to love me the way my uncle did
Except you’re not gonna to go to court for doing it
Be a guillotine or my girl instead
Either way, I said you’re giving me head
I’m gonna love you, baby, the right way
Shawty with a body looking hotty when I say
Girl
We go into the bedroom exchanging nervous laughter
Why’s it called dry humping if I always need a towel after?
You spread your naked legs and I see that wound that never healed
Even though you’re yelling for me, I can tell your lips are sealed (I've been around)
We’re both aware of my erection
You ask if I have protection
I say "No. I mean, I tried to buy 'em once I was in the convenience store, my old baby sitter walked in, I had to hide them near the Tic-Tacs. I was so embarrassed, I peed myself a little bit."

[Break]
Girl
Girl

[Verse 2]
Insert a euphemism
A sexy mental prism
Increase my pelvic rhythm
Fill you with my syllogism
I know your body and I know how to please you
Don’t thank me, thank Wikipedia
Guys don’t go down, well I am
What the fuck is that
I should have brought my diagram
Ooh, did you feel that
That was an educated guess
Ooh yeah, did you feel that
That one was a sneeze, my bad
I'm allergic to one type of cat
High school party, senior year
None of that happened 'cause I wasn’t invited

[Chorus]
I'll be in the sky (I'll be there)
I'll be there (Oh, all right)
Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky (I'll be there)
I'll be there (Oh, all right)
Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky

[Verse 1]
Remember when I leave
That the one in the mirror ain't me
It's just someone that I call B.o.B
It's kinda me, but it's not
It's just a mask, that I got
So that I can rap and get off my block
Reminiscin' my past when I was a toddler
Sittin' in grass and playin' with blocks
To failing my classes, now I'm on lockdown
Not writin' and readin' a lot
Money and weed is in my shoebox now
When I'm tryna get me a Glock (Bow!)
'Cause I thought I was at the end of my line
Then I found out it was all in my mind
That's why I'm here, to end all the fear
We all gon' die and leave from here like yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributin' mo' fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I die
And say goodbye
So long, sayonara
I'll have to catch you tomorrow maybe
'Cause baby

[Chorus]
I'll be in the sky (I'll be there)
I'll be there (Oh, all right)
Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky (I'll be there)
I'll be there (Oh, all right)
Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky

[Verse 2]
Everybody here gon' die one day
So while I'm here I'ma find my way
That's my forte, that's why I'm here
To open up your ear and speak this real
Beatin' down your block with a tooth
The gold teeth don't really match with a suit
Nowadays folk would rather rap than go to school
'Cause they feel if they black, then they gotta have a tool (Blah!)
But it don't really seem that bad
After all, everybody wanna kick back
They wanna sip 'gnac, they wanna sip Goose
They wanna get down, they wanna get loose
They wanna get blowed, they wanna see the truth
They wanna get old just like you
But since ain't nobody gonna be responsible
I'ma have to be the one to show, let's go

[Pre-Chorus]
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributin' mo' fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I die
And say goodbye
So long, sayonara
I'll have to catch you tomorrow maybe
'Cause baby

[Chorus]
I'll be in the sky (I'll be there)
I'll be there (Oh, all right)
Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky (I'll be there)
I'll be there (Oh, all right)
Oh, all right (I'll be there)
I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky
(Oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh) Yeah (Oh) I'll be in the sky

[Outro]
I'll be there, oh all right, I'll be there
I'll be there, oh all right, I'll be there
I'll be there, oh all right, I'll be there
I'll be there, oh all right, I'll be there
(Tyga)

Uh, haha

Haah, gettin that money I been waiting' for
Ray Allen number nutting less than 20K a show
Used to wanna be a B-Baller now I ball without a coach
Heard she ain't fuckin', she ain't fuckin?

Haah, Gettin that money I been waitin' for
Ray Allen number nuttin less than 20K a show
Used to wanna be a B-Baller now I ball without a coach
Heard she ain't fuckin', she ain't fuckin?, then she gotta go!

I turn beast, Billy badass Geronimo
Call me young heart attack, you just give her minor strokes
Patty cake dick her down then she row, row her boat
Penetrated in her throat
Now she in a comatose
Been waitin' ages my nigga kicked in the fuckin' door
Had me on some Bullshit
Manifestin' evidence
Ever since turn into a bull Carlos Boozer shit
Send a killer, kill the stage on some thriller shit
Said she don't swallow on her knees
She goin' spit it out like a policy
I'm so nasty fuck her in the back seat
Doggystyle Lassie Mr. boombastic, Shaggy!
Motherfuck the law, I Pac all y'all

For my family, my dawgs to my mother, bless her heart
I am her only son, and her son ain't far
Shinnin' I'm a star, nigga
Luminous charm
Just blew up but I been a bomb
Boys tryna show up, gettin' shitted on
I'm at the game courtside with my camo's on
Herringbone, snap back
Gettin' lap dance while you gettin' laughed at
I swear this that nigga dig a whole
Get you buried track
And you've awaken the dead the anti-christ is back
I know you don't give a fuck about me
I swear I don't give a fuck about you
So I'm a get this money
And count it all day while you muthafuckas say who dat!

[Intro]
This is a dedication motherfucker
This is Gangsta Grillz you bastards

[Verse]
Nigga we bussin and bussin
To the banga bus
No we don't run for the olympics
But the flame's with us
I got that 'tussin
That scummy and the angel dust
So pick you high I will supply
And correct changes, what's up
We bring the bus in
We bussin, like this thang's for us
You niggas is sleeveless man
You can't hang with us
I got a bitch who speaks spanglish
She keep her bangels danglin'
And the cocaine is right up in her anus
Old Wayne is right up in the spot
Like he's supposed to be!
Got hova at the game
And now he coachin' me!
But I been the champion
Happy as I ever been
Lampin' in the Hamptons like
What the fuck is a hammock?
The chef up in the kitchen like
What the fuck is a sammich?
I'm like we need to find middle ground
We need balance
Challenge me, that'd be to my advantage
I'm outstandin' like standin' outside
Up in the twister and walkin'
Not damaged
Standin' outside up in the blizzard
And walkin' hot handed
Servin' nickle bags in Iraq
Bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickle black if I wreck
Bet I will not panic
Cop another one the next day
And drive it crazier
The seat to be lazier
Shit'll be gravier
Nina Sarafeena my girl, so then I baby her
Waving her at two crazy
Fugazez I'm too brazy
Three brazies deep
We got 380's and P80's
Nice 9's, M10's
M1's and 12 Gauges
Shell casings
Money put up for jail cases
Bail making
My momma say
Tuck your chain son!
They'll take it
I hit her with one of them stale faces
Like, I'll be damned mama
They know who I am mama
I'm still your little boy
But to them I'm the man mama
Fuck with your boy man
Hollygrove the hood nigga
Throw it in your face
'Till you get that understood

[Verse 1: DC Pierson]
Whoa!
What'd you get, amnesia?
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or something
And my bank balance were around a grand or something
Ask you something:
Do you think I'm common like sense is?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend
Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the Tin Man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the lean time don't come crying for the thin man
In the meantime I'll be building my portfolio
All these other dudes eradicated like polio
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks
I bet you'll wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone
Now I'm all gassed up like Exxon
Girls see the money like I fucking got checks on
I don't even know if this girl really likes me
Picking up the check like I'm working at Nike
Talking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me
Then I find out she's trying to break in the industry
That's really lame
I still hit it
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
I'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me
Yes, homie I'm a man of my word
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd
And, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
I know my girl out there somewhere
And if you hear this, you should come here
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here
As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes
Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi
If I go too fast down this road I end up like Left Eye
I’m wondering would it be better if I left life
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I’m gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone, looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her what she crying for
I’m so fresh I’m wondering "why didn’t I design clothes?"
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they gon' make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean? No
Man please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils
(ahem) Shut up bitch swallow
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It’s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life dog it’s me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit
And I don’t mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's selfless
I’m feeling like a crab in a bucket
That’s just tryna get it crackin'
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish
And it’s a dream come true that you signed me
Big Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee
People asking me how it happened, man I tell 'em
I Rolex-ed the situation and just had perfect timing
And you already know where to find me
Bitch I'm connected to the D like Siamese
So if you see me out of town getting money
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly
So say what up if you see us
And the D is burn rubber and the Sean man lead us
Like being undefeated, feeling undefeated
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus
Glad to do any interview or dope feature
Come holla at a nigga as I’m trying on sneakers
Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can’t be it
You are just a hundred-and-one percent bitch
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
And I don’t want fans, I want believers
Race to success so I'mma keep pedalin'
Cuz my mama man she deserve everything
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her
Then best believe she gon' get a wedding ring
But I don’t know if I believe in love to be honest
Cuz every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up
And that’s why girls wanna leave us
Tell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us
Won’t stop till we end up on that show Cheaters
But I bet you couldn’t spot me if a nigga wore cheetah
And I be in the strip-club Teasers
Giving all the girls what’s needed
Honest dog had so many problems dog
I could hand 'em out and be labeled a fuckin' teacher
So respect my hand gesture
I dare any nigga try and come test us
You a mothafuckin' act dog, a A.C.T. that’s why niggas try and test ya
A-Dub how the hell we gon' make a mil
Pay the bills man, I ain’t tryna waste a deal
If you could make a deal believe you could break a deal
And if you can’t keep your promises then don’t say you will
Nigga don't say you will

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I bought a whole O to smoke
I’m riding high
My niggas with me, they down to ride
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hatin’ on me hard cause my paper right
Money from the floor way up to the sky
Now they wanna know and they wonder why
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it’s homicide
And I’m killin’ ‘em

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
It ain't even fair
Got the Mazi’ out, look like Nicki here
White drop head, call it white chalk
Burgundy insides, 57 sauce
And nigga I’m killin ‘em, bring the body bags
Count a million, fill the body bag
In my murder coupe, call it toe tag
Spend a grip nigga, call me 4 Jags
And nigga I’m killin’ ‘em, call a murder case
Got my Rolli’ on, got the murder face
Roll another blunt, dust my shoulders off
Niggas hatin’ Young, watch me shake ‘em off

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Niggas hatin’ on me hard cause my paper right
But I’m killin’ ‘em, it’s homicide
I’m killin’ ‘em, it’s homicide
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it’s homicide
I’m killin’ ‘em

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
With black on black cars coming through
Presidential shit, tints on the whip
So dark can’t see who riding in that bitch
Suits and tie’s no questions why
Somebody get a box ready for these guys
No four door, had the coupe that ride
That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly
No games though, no names spoke
This crack right here, cocaine flow
I don’t know what you doing but I’m paid bro
Yeah I pitch that 9 like pedro

Stuck in the car with my nigga I’m ready to ride
We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
Keep telling everybody what you gonna do
Middle finger like fuck what you going through
All I know is that money that I’m going to
And them gang boys wanna bore you
Like wassup cause I told you
Just money in the pocket, fold you
T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G Gang

[Hook + Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
First 48, first 48
Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48
I ain't worried about spending bread cause I got more to make
Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
Hundred for a show, can you afford a date
And that’s just one show, imagine what my tour gon make?
Police ran up on my tour bus
But hey my niggas more money more problems
More lawyers on the case
Niggas at the Grammys
I was at the crib working
Heard they little diss but I’m just being the big person
Never been trained, still my aim near perfect
Everything I spits murder, bow!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
She want to sex me of course
Cause I pull up in a Porsche
I make love to the money
But she can’t one stop my voice
Got a shit load of hundreds
Got a bag full of loud
Got a hand full of 20’s
I threw that shit in the crowd
I’m playing 50 and Gucci
Don’t play with 50 or Gucci
Cause they got goonies that do you
That hit your ass with the uzi
All my fans protest at my most recent arrest
I smoke nothing but the best
Here a toast of success
And little mama want to creep with me
I know she want to sleep with me
It gotta be the g in me
Cause ain't no R&B in me
Mr. Icecream man call me Mr. TMZ
Like a blindfolded man niggas ain't seeing me
It’s Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I just brought a drop just recently
I killed the parking lot just recently
I just brought a whip just recently
I made another flip just recently
I just bust a check just recently
I bust a bad bitch just recently
I’m screaming out “who want a piece of me?!”
I just got a deal just recently

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
50 and Gucci nigga this shit equals bread
Homie fuck with the paper, I'm trying to take off your head
We get the check from the music, we get the cash from the trap
When it comes to the money nigga we right where its at
Where it at! where it at! where it at! where it at! here it is!
The sickest shit, we filthy fucking nigga rich
Always on some crazy shit, blame it on some baby shit
Lambo round that autobahn, speeding like I bought a lot
Ain't got to talk to get a bitch, what you think we bought it for
Catch me riding solo, you know I got the strap
That pistol like them pills ho you know im popping that
I hit that button on your block and drop the top on my convertible
I’m known to find a nosey rat but ain't nobody heard of you
They call me king, cha-ching that money coming in
Man everything I seen is over cause I’m hood
My pinky ring, thats stacks, man thats a hundred racks
The way it bling makes dope boys want to move crack

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I just brought a drop just recently
I killed the parking lot just recently
I just brought a whip just recently
I made another flip just recently
I just bust a check just recently
I bust a bad bitch just recently
I’m screaming out “who want a piece of me?!”
I just got a deal just recently

[Intro]
Yeah
Hold on, turn me up a little bit more
Yeah, bitch
I always wanted to do this shit
This is it, what
Luchini
Nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fresh up off the plane
Real niggas embrace my music and bitches go insane
Even the kids throwing up the gang
They don't bother pronouncing my name, they just look at my chain
Boy, how much you spent on it?
This ain't nothing but hard work and what you can get from it
Ain't no toilet paper, but this smell like the shit don't it?
Smoking chronic and drinking gin 'til we get sick stomached
And them suckers ain't gotta like it 'cause your bitch love it
I'mma roll it, she gonna light it
Tell me she in desperate need of a pilot
I told her kick her feet up
We gonna go to my crib, soon as I roll this weed up
Call some friends of yours and we could all have a smoke-out
You ain't gotta hold it too long, this is rapper weed
Couple hits is all you gonna need
In my Versace frames, I'm blazed
Somewhere on the island, smoking some ray
Middle of the day, drunk dialing
Be surprised by how high a nigga get
I'm a different kind of fly, we ain't on the same shit, nigga

[Hook]
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
(Hey Jerm, keep all that, that's great
I'mma just run the next one, that cool?)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
No need to apologize, you should know how fly niggas do
Only EZ-Widers, been done with them cigarillos, fool
I been on the road, shopping and killing them interviews
Heard I left a major deal, but my paper major still
And all of them fans in love with me, 'cause I say what's real
So I can never give a fuck how a hater feel
But, uh, every time they send a driver for me and Will
I call it doing my talking on the field
At first niggas was tough, they don't wanna be gangstas now
Traces of my flow, yeah, they copy and paste my style
Wouldn't think I notice it, while in my hotel
Smoking with your bitch, fool
And this is it, what
Relax your feet, put on some music, roll a zip up
And we gonna smoke it 'til it's gone, ever see me cough?
Can't speak for suckers who do because I'm G'd up
What
Haha! Ah

[Hook]
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land
Won't land, won't land
I won't land

[Outro]
Yeah
Taylor Gang, Paper Planes
Shit you burn after you roll
Hoes everywhere we go
They payin' for my shows
Model bitches and hella smoke

[Intro: Mac Miller & Wiz Khalifa]
Mm-hmm
And you know, and you know
It's the only way it go
Hey
Say, hey (She know who this is by)
Uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (Keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some?

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snapback
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
High to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Passin' around the weed, no problems at all
And you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Mac Miller]
Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (Keep floatin') (Hey)
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one (Hey, hey)
And roll me some?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Then you can pass that, we floatin' along
So much smoke, we got the words high wrote in the song
Girl, I try to come and make you smile
I'm gone, so will you wait a while?
As soon as I come home, we gon' smoke and then I'll stay a while
Some people hate my style, some people love it though
And all these kids who wanna clone me, they ain't comin' close
Politickin' joints, we countin' none of your votes
I'm gettin' everybody high, so you can puff on ya roach
Shorty used to all these players, tell her, "Fuck with a coach"
I just want you to come over, roll me somethin' to smoke
Hey, my mind be cookin' rhymes up, live until my time's up
Hate me then they love me, tell 'em try to make they minds up
Barbers and they line me up, ID was on the beat
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Smokin' weed, we got no problems at all
All you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we ride and we smoke 'til we can't anymo'
And keep floatin'

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (Keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some?

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Hey
Haha, that was the best day ever
What up, Wiz?
Rostrum, ID Labs
Blaow
Most Dope

[Intro]
Fury
Yeah, yeah, huh, aye! What the fuck I got to worry about now?
Nigga, you think after weatherin' the storm and comin' from the extremes I came from
You think I'mma come all this way to get scared? Hahah!
Nah, nigga, I'mma motherfuckin' win
Nigga, if all this shit go out the window right now, man
I'm all too familiar with this shit
My nigga, I'm straight, you dig? Please believe that shit, man Hey!

[Hook 1]
You can keep the car, the clothes, the money and the hoes
Just gimme a couple of O's, drop me off at the sto'
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the dancers and the boppers, the plexers and the poppers
Let me fill up my Impala, go and holla at my partners
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Verse 1]
I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist
A lot of glamour and glitz, but shawty I don't need it
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'm a son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab, flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and got it poppin' like some bubblegum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nuttin but a young
Buck, niggas say, "What?", then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts change a old nigga whole face up
Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They'll try you once, 'til you pull a .40, then tell 'em shawty don't play wit' us
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care 'bout catchin' no case, bruh
Don't consider me, not statistically, another nigga it's too late for
Hey, wait, bruh, bet any nigga came from that?
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that

[Hook 2]
Hey, you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine, and somewhere I can slang
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the clones and the clowns, the throne and the crown
Well-known in the town that I'm holdin' it down
So I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Okay now, now when I spit it, I spit it how I live it
Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction
I'm a livin' legend.. no stuntin', no reppin'
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected
I'mma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, "pistol here, pistol there," "violation here, violation there"
You can ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the King, or in Detroit in the snow
I'm a pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low
But that's nothing, everybody say they got a story
Mine on "Larry King," theirs is on "Maury"
At the end of the day, the seams that won't go away
I guarantee the heart of the streets is straight

[Hook 1]
You can keep the car, the clothes, the money and the hoes
Just gimme a couple of O's, drop me off at the sto'
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the dancers and the boppers, the plexers and the poppers
Let me fill up my Impala, go and holla at my partners
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Snowman bitch (bitch), I ride two-seaters (vroom!!)
It's a cold world, so I keep two heaters (geyeah!)
I'm straight, you betta ask somebody (body)
Matter fact nigga you can just ask me (me)
A little over aggressive, yeah I just might be
But half the niggas in the hood just like me (damn!)
You wonder why a nigga talk eight balls all day?
You should try standin' around wit' eight balls all day (YEEEAAAHHH!!)
Somebody pray for me, I don't know nothin' else (AYE!)
Why should I help you, when you ain't tryin' to help yourself
I came in this game, fresh out the streets (yeah)
Who you kiddin' nigga, I put my life on these beats (YEAH!)
Fuck bein' broke, this a reality check (check)
While you mad at ya girl, ya betta check reality (AHAH!)
Gotta crawl 'fore you walk, you gotta think before you talk
Damn right they gon' hate (geyeah!) but tell them niggas I'm straight (AHAH!)

[Hook 2]
Hey, you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine, and somewhere I can slang
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the clones and the clowns, the throne and the crown
Well-known in the town that I'm holdin' it down
So I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Outro: Pimp C]
Say what it do? Young Pimp C know what I'm talking 'bout?
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some "king" shit, know what I'm sayin'?
On the cool y'know.. young nigga T.I. jumped out there
Said he was the king of the south
He ruffled a whole lotta niggas' feathers
But niggas didn't really understand what the nigga was talking 'bout
Y'know.. and uh.. so everybody had it twisted but..
Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggas' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggas shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggas' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggas out here
Talking 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talking 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?
And them niggas talking 'bout they "trill niggas"
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talking 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talking 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggas
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggas paid dues for, know what I'm talking 'bout?
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggas flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP!! And, and, and, and move around for the South
Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talking 'bout?
Now let's do this shit!

[Verse 1]
My life, screw it with a drunk bitch
Like what the fuck are we doin'
We kissin', I'm weezing, it's time to play Tetris
I play piano, jack off I'm anorexic
I'm fucking asthmatic, my records problematic
Talkin' to myself because my therapist done had it
All the racial slurs from the wangsters playin' from Lenny Kravitz
Love Lockdown like I am some sort of faggot
But I'm not in the first place
Waiting on my dad to say hi on my birthday
Cause Jesus wouldn't even be my friend on Church day
I plan on getting back *censored* the worst way
In the jungle, I planned on the keeper
Inside of the cage cause I'm a motherfuckin' Zebra
Obama's in office, niggas get job like teachers
Lookin' out, retarded kids screamin' out fuck slob, Jesus

[Refrain: Casey Veggies]
And I can write a hook fast
I can get straight to the cash
Y'all niggas come last, I'm first though
No rehearsal, I know it all like Urkel
You can call it commercial
So turn it up, turn it up
Odd Future won't stop it

[Verse 2]
I make music for a reason, didn't vote Obama
So you can charge me with treason
Year round asshole, the fuck you season
The flu, I'm sick that's why everybody sneezin'
I'm always cheesin', smile for a reason
Fuck as I fuck you, I'm always teasin'
My daughter need milk and a quilt
So I'm sellin' the the haze for six bucks cause she always sneezin'
Some people need drugs, some people need dubs
On they car note to go to the club
But really, really, really, all I need deep down is a hug

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Look, I'm back like niggas on a bus
With a Rosa Parks state of mind, I don't give a fuck
And I'm strollin' Down South like Good Luck Chuck
In a Malcolm X shirt chillin' with the Ku Klux
Klan, I ain't nothin' to fuck with
O.F. clan they ain't nothin' to fuck with
The O.F. clan they ain't nothin' to fuck with
This Black Snake Moan is somethin' to suck bitch

[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 1]
First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign
When we were making out, you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way, I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off, "Hey babe what's going on?"
"Sorry I can't make it out", sad face emoticon
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag along
Face down, ass up, that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
"You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me!"
I'm always fucking childish, you knew that when you met me

[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 2]
You ain't that fine, bitch what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls, I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right, my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying "This nigga think he all that. He fucking sucked in bed", well uhh…
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it

[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Outro]
Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you, wants you, wants you

[Intro]
I'm recordin' that shit on the fuckin' little mic
By the little camera thing on the fuckin' Mac book
So this shit is choppy and bad quality, but fuck it
Wolf Gang, Ace Creator

[Verse 1]
Somebody tell Justin Beiber that I'm fuckin' coming
Ain't no point in runnin', I'm a nigga, just a little quicker
So I catch him stretchin', have him guessin' where his cracker throat
Chop his balls off and use his skin to make a baby coat
Ain't he dope? No, he the same as shit that Tyler wrote
This is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin' coke
Riley's here, Connie's dead, pickin' pussy pisses pike
She won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite
Apprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin' sin
Make Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes
Wrap around 'til they hit the ground and they hear a sound
That doesn't make sense like nigga kids wearing cap and gowns
This my album, and when your parents try to come around
Do the fuckin' exact opposite of turnin' it down
And when they try to get parental and start talkin' loud
Tell them that you're from the Wolf Gang and you're fuckin' proud
Then start barkin' loud 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down
But call the pigs, who'll probably come in bout a half an hour
Tell them that your sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin' shower
But make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power
This is the shit that is makin' me cynical
The clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical
Fuckin' voices follow me, emulatin' like twitter roll
O.F. is a cult, assume that I'm the fucking general
So when I mention suicide, I'm being Mr. Literal
The coke inside nine capsules, fuck it let's split a roll
Life is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin' toll
1-800-fuck-this-shit
Seven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin' gold
But when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will probably have my soul
It's hot down there, fuck that, bitch I'm hot as coals
Out the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol
And a firetruck and Arizona durin' summertime
In a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spit purple wine
Wolf Gang pete and gon' live, running outta time
The fuck I give is the same as the next line

[Outro]
(Fuck everything) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
So the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit

[Verse 1]
I lick the gun when I'm done
'Cause I know that revenge is sweet
So sweet
This is a gang, ladies thang
Baby bang, tell me what you need, oh
Any motherfucker wanna disrespect
Playing with fire finna get you wet
How it feel down there on your knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I got this
Girls like a soldier
Trip and it's goin' down, down, down

[Chorus]
I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you
If they get you, they get me
So come on, let's go
Bitch, I'm with you
If you with it, you with me
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'm standing high
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangsta for life

[Verse 2]
We drivin' by with them headlights off
We know where you stay
Know what you did, we don't play that shit
Nigga we don't play, no
Everybody cried when you did your dirt
Acting like a bitch finna get you hurt
Breaking lives down to their knees, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I got this
Girls like a soldier
Trip and it's goin' down, down, down

[Chorus]
I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you
If they get you, they get me
So come on, let's go
Bitch, I'm with you
If you with it, you with me
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'm standing high
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangsta for life

[Bridge]
Guns (Check), Girls (Check)
Come on, we ain't done yet
Got a lot to handle
We ain't takin' over the world yet
We're an army
Better yet, a navy
Better yet, crazy
Guns in the air
Guns in the air
Guns in the air
Can't hurt us again when you come around here
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns in the motherfuckin' air, oh

[Chorus]
I'm down for life
Gangsta for life
I'm down for life
Gangsta for life
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'll stand and fight
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangsta for life

[Outro]
I lick the gun when I'm done
'Cause I know that revenge is sweet

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]
Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leave
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 1]
Album on hold, whole world on hold
The crowd is like, "HO!", operator's like, "Hold" ("Please hold")
Man, now ain't that cold
I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie that's up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No
Whoa, like the opposite of go
That ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhyming, let's just say butterfly-ee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em, tell 'em, don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing

[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh

[Verse 2]
Doctor, doctor please, the fame ain't painless enough
"That's cause you ain't famous enough
You got a little game but your name ain't ringin' enough"
He said "Take two of these, put some change in my cup"
I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
Out, ouch
I'm tellin' you this all from a therapist's couch
"Tell me about your mother, what she's all about"
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
Damn, jeez
The world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots

[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh

[Verse 3]
And when I finally make it, I'ma stunt so hard
Evil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't comin' back
Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah, that'll make 'em hurt
"Huh?" said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said "You need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up
You're already here, just be yourself from here up"
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Somethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from

[Hook]
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and it's how it's gon' be
Until I get there
Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there
When I get there, whoa, oh

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
1, 2, 3, and

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Now, they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plenty of dough, man
Icy Audemar, Henny gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow fo' my dough
Why would you try with that guy?
Scene told you he'd keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq, I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coup's up, take the new lane for a sec
12" thump, new Kane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer in a 'cuzzi
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the UZI, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and count it
Our cheddar stackin' just like a mountain
You heard about it, she running her mouth
She want's to ride it, she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as Hell but she's too excited
Her man look like he wanna fight
But he ain't doing nothing but running his mouth

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Next who wanna move is getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believin'
I'm Marked For Death, Hard to Kill like Steven
When Jake come, I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and count it
Our cheddar stackin' just like a mountain
You heard about it, she running her mouth
She want's to ride it, she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as Hell but she's too excited
Her man look like he wanna fight
But he ain't doing nothing but running his mouth

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crack music and the kings of the clubs
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little songs be sounding like our's
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah, I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you filling my spot?
Why you niggas getting mad at us? We shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, Fab, Big and Bust of the stand if you can't reach
Let's go

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Foxy Brown]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and count it
Our cheddar stackin' just like a mountain
You heard about it, she running her mouth
She want's to ride it, she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as Hell but she's too excited (Uh, uh)
Her man look like he wanna fight (Fox then B.I.G)
But he ain't doing nothing but running his mouth

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
Who fucking with Fox? Who want it with I?
Bust a shot for me and Big from the ville from the sky
Got my joan fross shit on, hop off my dick
Canary bangle-round I ain't gon' 20 carrots on this bitch
Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six
Bedstuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
On Nastrand Ave, ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill Na Na, squeezing the llama
Bog roll dutty, Foxy and Poppa

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Run for your gun you suckers
B.I.G. I'm a get them motherfuckers
Don't you worry about a thing, bang-bang-boogie
I got a few chickens that's gon' work that noogie
In the 'Lac with a sack, go and put it on the mat
What it do nephew (Where Brooklyn at?)
Uh, turning it out, run in your house
Gun in your mouth, motherfucker, quit running your mouth

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and count it
Our cheddar stackin' just like a mountain
You heard about it, she running her mouth
She want's to ride it, she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as Hell but she's too excited
Her man look like he wanna fight
But he ain't doing nothing but running his mouth

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
What you really want from a nigga?

[Intro]
Yeah, uh
Uh, yea
Yea, uh
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh
Nothing but sweat, tears
Just another perspective
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black, and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that, get gun clapped for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
'Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers (yeah)
Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
'Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)

[Hook]
The things that I've seen (seen)
The dreams that I dream (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it gets better baby
Don't let this world break you (you) nah, nah
Don't let them break you (you)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto bird circling
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them (fuck)
Another day in the Ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar? Even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign (yeah)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind (why?)
'Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yeah

[Hook]
The things that I've seen (seen)
The dreams that I dream (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it get better baby
Don't let this world break you (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you (you)

[Intro: Hittman]
It's fuckin ackrite
Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

[Verse 1: Hittman]
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
"Yo, is this your man?" "No."
Grab the bitch's hand, "I'm Hittman."
Bling! Gold chain gleam
"You're very eligible for my summer league team."
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite

[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the huss, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

[Hook: Hittman]

[Trey Songs]
If it ain't stuck in yo head then I'mma beat it in
Runnin through the green like my last name Peterson
Tomlinson, Ladanian bitch this is my stadium
If they say defeat while in my leather seats I'm suede'n em
I fuck up..(backup) if ain't stuck in yo head then I'mma beat in
Runnin through the green like my last name Peterson
Tomlinson Ladanian bitch this is my stadium
If they say defeat while in my leather seats I'm suede'n em
I fuck'd up persuade'n em
Ballin in the game like a player that's created and
Three dikes and I'm fadin' em
Rap unleashin' demons yet I sing like I'm arcadian
Realest nigga living walk in a badd bitch and her body fake as shit
Super-Cali-Fragil-Istic-Expi-Ali-Docious
Think I might just call yo chick and say I want my toes kissed
Tell yo baby momma I will pay to get her nose fixed
Her breast too A B C D E F you I'm special

The best and you are errthing that's left of that
I'm gone take it all while you while you get whatever's left of that
I'm next at bat so throw that shit
I'm cold as shit you bogus bitch you know this shit is over with
Matter who you go and get all you niggas slow as shit
I turn these women on like my name was remote controller dick
Jumpin on this track
Such a locust diss the money shoutin' haters outta focus
Pussy niggas need to change their gender
Boy I'm colder than december
Your nothin' to forget and I am somethin' to remember
Eatin' this fuckin track like there were nothin' here for dinner
Attentions what we all want I am in the center
And its rightful I'm spiteful I found out who you wife'd fool
That's just to get up in her
Say they the shit but I run the sewer I'm master splinter
I only want for bitch niggas to exit when I enter
You see I am a major crash you just a fender bender
No contenders you so limber see I'm stiffted and my mistress
Is this rap shit
I came in with my main bitch we live in peace and harmony
But this rap ho flow so cold I swear its like she callin me
Fuck the way you thought of me I'm nothin like you thought I'd be
That's even if you follow me
Appreciative you oughta be cannot what you want of me
I'm mostly in the A that's if you wannabe's wanna see
I don't respect authority you can catch me overseas
Pretty women notice me and fall like some autumn leaves
Guess they think alot of me
Everything you oughta be
My money is a part of me so fuck you and your policies
Sometimes I get the feelin' I am the peoples property
Life is crazy complicated then I smoke alot of weed

Drink alot of liquor have alot of sex
Addictive lifestyle it'll prolly be the death of me
Hope my momma never hear this shit and then think less of me
You don't know how this pressure be I guess I got some stress in me
Times I wanna spaz show the world the Kanye West in me
But fuck it im'ma star the American dream
Like we not out and I.I. smoking the Canadian green
I'm higher than Aladdin and his arabian queen
Carpet in the sky told you I was fly
Came to knock em down so I love the way they lie
I run this enterprise got a complicated mind
And I dumb it down for you stupid niggas every time
I'm sicker every line they wish that I'd decline
But I stay on the grind baby bad brakes haters
I'm the shit won't you tell me how my ass taste
Ricky Bobby daddy say if you ain't first you last place
Movin' at a fast pace
You niggas is butts call em ash trays
Wanna be the mothafuckin' man you can ask Trey
Murder in the first my accomplice is
SK on the track we kill this shit

[Intro]
One day, leggo!

[Chorus]
One day, I'ma be so rich that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch
I'ma have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

[Verse 1]
Hey, walkin’ out the crib with a smile on my face
Superhero, utility belt tied around my waist
Tryna be next, quicker than the reflex
Tannin' down in Key West, every class recess
N-n-n-n-now my pockets deeper than ya V-neck
Hoes up on my dick 'cause I look like Ryan Seacrest
I'm buzzin' like a bees nest, stay up out my bees wax
My people like to party, so inform us where the freaks at
Livin' out my dream, people still sleepin'
The best night of your life, but we do this every weekend
Life couldn't get better, I hope it lasts forever
When I spit my verse, they gon' remember every letter like...

[Pre-Chorus]
Day in and day out
We tryna get this cake now
You think you fly? Just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good, don't waste it
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces

[Chorus]
One day, I'ma be so rich that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch
I'ma have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

[Verse 2]
Hey, they seem surprised, with the look that's in their eyes
How I could be myself and do away with their disguise
I advise homies to stay homies
Few people you can trust, all the OG's told me
When I was just a shawty, strummin' my guitar
Playin' my piano, had a band in my garage
Sittin' down with the homies, playin' PlayStation
Tryna find a crib where their parents on vacation
Hey, why you grillin'? Put a smile on your face, bitch
We takin' shots all around, gettin' wasted
Came a long way from freestylin' in my basement
Show some love to the people that I came with 'cause...

[Pre-Chorus]
Day in and day out
We tryna get this cake now
You think you fly? Just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good, don't waste it
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces

[Chorus]
One day, I'ma be so rich that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'ma still sleep on the couch
I'ma have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

[Chorus]
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back

[Verse 1]
Uh, I used to rock a double XL
Now the ladies all say I dress well
With a nice pair of jeans, LRG or Evisu
Crew neck sweatshirt, hat and some clean shoes
Pockets stayed equipped with some paper and some gold piff
Pack of gum, squares, Blackberry and a phone clip (Goddamn)
Got Most dope clique, bunch of mothafuckers lookin' fresh
Crooks and castle dress, sloppy sloppy haters shouldn't mess
Walkin' by your lady and I'm sorry if I took her breath
You was just baby, cryin' 'til you end up shook to death (Bitch)
Fade away like an Etch A Sketch
Don't second guess, ain't nobody better dressed (Uh-uh)
Text hoes wearin' less clothes than her mama like
Church girl, always go to school, she the honest type (Haha)
But when it comes to boys, she like 'em bad
So holla at the kid, I got swag

[Chorus]
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back

[Verse 2]
Knick-knack, paddy-whack, give that boy some clothes
Imitate the kid, you may get yourself some hoes (Haha)
Snap back, flat cap, abstract swagger (Uh-huh)
Kid come correct, never messin' up the pattern
Y'all jigsaw puzzle, mismatch mess (Mess)
Got my J's on with some jeans, lookin' fresh
Yes, my colors match
And ain't no other cats lookin' like the kid
Yeah, none of y'all fuck with Mac (Ha)
You rockin' somethin' that lookin' like a lumberjack
How you wearin' three different t-shirts under that?
Teach you how to dress real stylish, I'm the wildest
Nothin' on me lookin' childish (Haha)
Fire talk, I am hot
And y'all is just some mild sauce
Got my clothes tailored, fit so nicely
Soon you'll see these mothafuckers dressin' just like me

[Chorus]
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had some, had some baggy gear, now, now my clothes tailored
Had a, had a fitted cap, now, now I rock a snap back

[Verse 1]
Long money, hopes and dreams
Always be around them niggas wit paper but got your own money
It's yo world, buy this drink for you girl
You said tell the DJ play this song for me

Better weed tons of drink, love the way I dress, let her rub my ink
Hell yeah, I'm fly, that's why they all beneath, me

[Hook]

Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin low, low, low
Foot on the gas when I see you yeah cause she ready to go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Throw it in the air watch that paper fall
Don't know how much I came here with
End of the night, shit, she gon take it all
See them diamonds in my chain

Rushing to the bar, I need another round of drinks
Then it's to my car, puff a pound of dank
Now we in the stars, and I'mma make it rain
Drown the sink

[Outro]
I'm throwing money up and watching her go round and round
Watching her go round and round
I'm throwing money up and watching it come down, come down
Watching it come down, come down
And we can go to my house or we can go to your crib
We can jump in your car, you can see how I live
But I'm still throwing money up
So much I'm losing count, can't count
So much I'm losing count, can't count
Yeah I'm talkin bout

[Verse 1]
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

[Refrain]
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (Woo)

[Verse 2]
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh

[Refrain]
If I can see it (Woo), then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh I believe I can fly (Woo)

[Bridge]
Hey, 'cause I believe in me
Ohhh

[Refrain]
If I can see it (Woo), then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly (Woo!)
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
Hey, if I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly, hey (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly) (I can fly)
(Woo!) (I can fly)

[Outro]
Fly-eye-eye

[Verse 1]
I remember when I first laid eyes on you
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another myspace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit 'send'
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing, honestly it made me only want you more
Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labled 'urgent'
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name
But the fact that you're hittin me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moments
And now I'm emailing my love a dozen digital roses

[Hook]
So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Just click approve, you're killing me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's face it, it's a sad situation
When we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis
Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of 1 to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damnit, I'd been waitin too long
I even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)
But its hard for me to not hate
When I'm on myspace I never see my face in your "Top 8"
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a "lol" matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?
If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back
And forth for three days (rephrase)
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and "Ichat"
Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet (shit)
And be persistent until my name is under "who you'd like to meet"

[Hook]

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smittin with your pictures wishin you would feel the same
I'll admit I get a lil jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense
Make me out, romancing the thought
Of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin you out
And if you love then what I'm speaking about, then say something
I check my inbox 10 times and there ain't nothing
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah its time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry
This is madness, xoxo dash Travis

[Hook]
Uh life's good so I'm feelin great
Call me Outta Town Shawty, er'y week a different state
3 cell phones, pennsylvania plates
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Sayin lifes good so im livin great
Call me outta town shawty er'y week a different state
3 cell phones, pennsylvania plates
On a four month march, tryna get my money straight (money straight)
I'm bout cake - to keep the world turnin
Hundred thousand dolla earnin while im big blunt burnin
But to these hoes im a pimp like iceberg
Prolly hurt ya feelins if I told ya what the ice worth
A couple grand, i'll hitcha with a nice verse
Kush when I land mix it in when I light purp
And I like purp - I fucks with kush more
Niggas talkin reckless I expect thats what the hoods for
What up hazelwood? nigga ooh woop
I'm a rapper's fear, I'm in your ear like a blue tooth
And my money old (old) but my shoes new
All them carats got ur girl open like a moon roof
Nigga who you? nigga who we?
We the taylor gang - they be like ooh weee
They be like who he? thats young khalifa man
Flyer than the ceilin fan ooh he gotta group of fans
I keep them groupie hoes yeah I gotta group of dough
All up in my pocket I dont needa wallet
Rubberband poppin ya'll niggasz ain't gettin stacks
Might as well sit back n relax
N watch what we doin dont watch me
Watch flava love or somethin on tv
Cuz this is tv nigga HD u can't afford me

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
See I've been going on and on forever
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gon' stop, never!
Most of this been good but I've seen some bad weather
And niggas who want shit now wouldn't even give me an umbrella
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
When I was 16, finna get put out my home
Now the man making money, my nigga, my money grown
And I can do what I what, went from being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but wasn't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don't get a chance to see me face to face
So you have to talk about me when I gone

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up
And all my jewelery ice aged, the piece frozed up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us
Get you to buy a drink then it's over cuz
We back around the time that she sober'd up
Shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never peeled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
It's the way we know
Wake up in the morn' like "where did all my paper go"
Grow some more weed and get medicated
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Stay away from the fake or phoney (phoney)
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)
The show-ow-owww (ow-owww)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas losing their roles
Can't play their position
One day they're down for the team
Next day they're missing
Same ones was all in the front
Suppose to be there for support
And half the time it's the ones you care for
Fuck you here for? Huh?

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, the money come, the money go
And when it come down to it
That's something niggas with real money should know
We partied a lot and drank, now they don't talk to me
I started off not so great, now I'm on top of things

[Verse 5: Chevy Woods]
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame
I see the bigger picture on the wall in a frame
Spent a couple of days OT making it rain
That was cool but I was thinking ocean views
Polo trunks shades on and boat shoes
Cantox lick the oil, my nigga and I ain't slipping
You won't stall me out, uh, bad transmission
So if for the better, yeah, nigga different
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twisting
Mattress money put up cause now my money different
Got a lot to say but ain't never try and listen
Record all night in the studio in the morn'
Playing back what we did, now tell me if that's wrong
Crack the Rozay, and pop a top or two
And toast to what this hard work got us to

[Verse]
It's the beat, he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softly, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, "Daddy, funk me"
I'm like, "Anywho's"
Seeds walkin' all out in the street without any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox   (Hahahahaha)
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it, back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated
In deep theta, let her hate the creep later
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ill
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit
("DOOM!")

[Intro: Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen

Moment of silence for the homeboy Soulja Slim, yeah
Fronting 'round here'll get your back chopped off
We do our own thing, we don't act like y'all

A old-school gangsta mack like the eighties
I look like Cita and act like Baby, yep
You play with me, I react like the Navy
Or better yet the army—you gon' need them for me, yep
And your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeking Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep it New Orleans
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets, yup
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples
Yeah, Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividends not little

Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Dickie shorts, Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out, here come the folk—"Damn"
Oh, Lord

[Break]

[Verse 2: André 3000]
As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set It Off" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
"Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!"
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—"Wham! Wham!"
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, "Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"
It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Hook: André 3000]
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute

[Outro: André 3000, Andrea Nivet + Delvida]
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja

[Eminem]
What's up with everybody beefin'
Everybody seem like they wanna beef
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody beefin' with everybody
This shit is crazy

[Verse 1: Dogmatic]
This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair
Terrorists live here, but I don't care
I'm making pot holes when I stomp, so don't stare
I stop to stomp competiton, with both fair
How dare, little soldier at ease
We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's Disease
We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons
Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones
If a green beans things, to my suggestion
Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average
It's serious! who can understand what I'm saying?
Yo Slim, tell them niggas (Eminem: We ain't playing!)
It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams
I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!

[Hook: Eminem]
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type a brother that'll, fuck yo mother, wit a fishnet rubber
I'mma misfit slash, nitwit
I love to put up biscuts, straight to a niggas lips, it'll fit
A biligerent and rowdy fellow
I'll dump yo body, and still fly away to Maui, on a teller
When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explain'
I'll change ya lauguage, wit a stainless
I'll contain, wit a name which to make you famous
I'mma deranged pit, I'll bend you till ya back touch ya anus
Don't ever take me to court, I'll whack the plantiff
Then beat the fuck out the baliff
A heinous, miscellaneous, nigga never miss, when the AK lift
I paint ya face wit, any weapon, just like "The Matrix"
They ain't steppin', don't even say shit
You heard about the bodies in my basement, you joinin' them, face it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Proof]
Laugh indictive, like Kim lipstick, and get a nose bleed
My blow speed, is like my hands working ten stick shifts
Captain ask, to stick my finger in the barrel of a Mac 10
And snatching the driver out the black Benz
Smashing his contact lens, my life start when his contract ends
"Go kiss-and-tell, and contact Kim!"
Let's be factually, actually, y'all ain't after me
Got (???) wit +Regis+, y'all beef is without the +Kathy Lee+
Told y'all my battlery, and go to war happily
How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me
My factulty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey
And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie
For lot being real, scared to pop wit the steel
It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled
Now how does it feel, with this Baretta to ya dome
And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home

[Hook] w/ Ab-libs

[Outro: Eminem]
You know what I'm sayin'
You want beef, we taking it to yo face
Fuck it, Dirty Dozen, Slim Shady
D-12, this shit is serious!
I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 1: Drake]
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear (yeah), best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard (I'm leanin')
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah! Talkin big big shit
I am rude, I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yeah and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars, haha

[Chorus: Drake & Nutt Da Kid]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (haan)
If I ever disappear ('bout time)
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard (they'll know)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (yeah, okay)
All I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 3: Nutt Da Kid]
I stunt hard, I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard, So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like "Izzy" after "gr"
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear, best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard

[Lupe Fiasco]
Well, first she had on baby clothes
Then she had on young lady clothes
Mom tried to keep her out the sexy clothes
Prom night she wore dressy clothes
Took her all night to get ready for
Retro now she want 80′s clothes
No colleges no scholarships so she put on some Navy clothes
Pregnant now its bigger clothes
Delivered now back in littler clothes
Different girl when the liquor flow
Stripper name, stripper clothes
Stripper pose on stripper poles
Then take off her stripper clothes
Right in front them gigolos
Cocaine where she stick her nose
Burnt out, turned out, bull dyke now she walk around in niggas' clothes
Turned out now she walk around in niggas clothes
Out the sad, out the bad
Goodwill got to give her clothes
Oh the humanity, like that burning dirigible
Richard Pryor lit on fire, she can’t tell what fit no more
And…

[Hook]
Who are you now?
It’s like everyday you change
Who are you now
Your style, your clothes, your name
Who are you now
So who are you now
Who are you now
Who are you now

So you spend all your time to fit in line
To fit in the crowd and even in your mirror’s eyes
Yourself you can’t identify
And just like the Energizer rabbit
You just be spinning round
And as it intensifies, your life it de-materializes

[B.o.B]
Today’s stylings, injecting like a virus
From TV screens to your iris
You buy what you are provided with
Whatever your size is
You lay it flat then iron it
And if you fight it, its like David verse Goliath
Cause that skin you supposed to hide it
Dress it up and deny it
Can't even go natural no more cause if do you probably won't get hired
So tell me who’s lying
If I am, I’m lying
On the ground but I’m flying
And they still tryna find me

[Hook]
Who are you now
It’s like everyday you change
Who are you now
Your style your clothes your name
Who are you now
So who are you now
Who are you now
Who are you now

(Beluga Heights)

[Intro]
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of clocks
The fear of time...

[Verse 1]
High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say, be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I ain't' got tiiiime
Leave me aloone

[Bridge]
Ain't that much time left
I've got to funk you now

[Hook]
Chronomentrophobia (x8)

[Verse 2]
Lord, be havin' mercy on my soul
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Born in 1975
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Now I'm dead
Remember what I said
I'm gone
Bow ya heads

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
People on the street, they panic and start running
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing, like, "What did he say?"

[Refrain]
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
In my living room watching, but I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old, something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out, today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
"When the rich wage war it's the poor who die"
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching, at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like, "What did he say?"

[Refrain]
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Okay, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Lil Wayne]
When I look into your eyes, it's over (When I look into your eyes, baby, yeah)
You got me hooked with your love controller (I know)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Come on)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)

The very next day she left we started beefing
And she don't never lie to me she keep it real
Yo bitch keep coming short my bitch keep wearing heels
She keep on standing tall she never stand me up
She'll go to war with anybody she don't give a fuck
She help me keep it on the road like a hub cap
So I keep her on my mind like a skull cap (Gucci)

[Hook]
She said if you love me, let me know
If you don’t then let me go

[Tyga - verse 1]
The memories soon fade, why couldn’t they be erased
You hoping it’s just a phase, your heart’ll heal within days
Some people think it’s wrong, being single isn’t right
But you hurt the right person you’ll be wrong all your life
Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual
Feelings when I’m close to you, fuckin' til’ the sky is blue
Morning time, home fries, cookin' with your t-shirt on
Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off
Ha, damn I’m nasty, I mean you make me nasty
Going the extra mile flyin' just to make me happy
Did it all, too much wasn’t enough
Now it’s gone but sometimes I sit and hope

[Adele]
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it

[Tyga - verse 2]
Whatever ever happened to love and being happy
Infatuated with lust; I loved you and now I’m backwards
Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted
Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas
Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it
Colors prevail and you turn into a fucking monster
Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde
Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
How do you manage but still do you
Can’t compromise, we all equal opportunists
It’s when I’m level headed they aiming to take my head off
Birds flock together, tell bitches I’m throwing bread off
Cold, women fall in love gettin' splintered
Strictly platonic, only thing she want is dinner
I can’t fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor
She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin

[Adele]
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it

[Tyga]
Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh
Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS
They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next
Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks
Go home
I ain’t tryna do you wrong
I’d rather be alone
Just sittin on the throne
Symphony crack!
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
Let me get this right let me get this clear…
Settle one more game, we gonna prove we’re as best this year!
Start right here, start right…
Right here in front of our folks, in front of our fans
Some of them…

…play no game, watch me do my thing
Bring it down like Wu-Tang …want my name?
..all the way, turn up, turn next
..off in this bitch
I’mma cute dog take what I see!
All shit, get a seat, light a Cush, can hear that shit!
Smoke… nigga, so… smell that shit!
Everybody lay it down, come on…
Everybody in the …come on…it’s your thing!

Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
…drop this beat, drop this beat!
From that gunshot straight ...
Country music got me rapping, I know why
You’ve been this shit since I was a child!
Hola, hola, what you got to say?
That the haters brought me back and.. a major way!

Best believe it for you…
Guess my people cut the crap an they’re saying:

Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
Now get your…
Or maybe if you’re ... some of us right here
Then none of these would matter
And...wouldn’t have to make a song with all these
Flutes, clarinets, trumpets and trombones
My drum shit is led by Louis Vuitton
Louis shoes, Louis drum sticks, and Gucci…
Who you think you’re fooling, you’re not fooling me son!
… favors, we ain’t doing you one!
Here some advice! ... an we’ll talk negotiations
If you’re hasting, we’re not pacing, we’re take it…
Understand, this corporation is more like a congregation
And come up with compilations that will have you make…
Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!

[Intro: Unnamed Man + Big Boi]
Drowning in the gray cell
To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell
One-two! Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!
Lucious! Sir Lucious!
Sir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered

[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
First rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place, family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run

[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 2: Big Boi (Sleepy Brown, Debra Killings)]
Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the (hot sauce!)

[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 3: Big Boi (Debra)]
1979, Dirty South, local lounge
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the dungeon plan 'cause we got that (Hot sauce)

[Hook: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown (Debra)]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Intro: Kanye West]
I mean wow. You know? Man

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say "I know"
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like "Hey, you might like this"
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, "Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle"

[Verse 2: Patti Labelle]
Time, they say (true story, 

[kanye west])
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in His time
The pain you carry
Will be left far behind

[Pre-Hook: (Patti Labelle) and Mary Mary]
If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
You will see the many blessings (blessings you have received)
When you give Him all the glory (glory)
Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee)
Listen to all the stories
Meant to sing Your name

[Hook]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 3: Patti Labelle]
You try to please everyone
Time to live your life
Release those old illusions
Stop wasting time and
Start embracing
His light and let it shine

[Verse 4: Patti Labelle]
(Don't you listen) when they say
(You won't make it) oh it ain't no way
(Through the madness) never stop believing in yourself
In the morning you'll see
All the answers that free
You from chains that would seem
To keep you standing still

[Hook]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

[Verse 5: Consequence]
I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams

[Hook x2]
Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your a child of The King
And I can do anything

[Outro]
Oh yes I can
Yes I can
I can do all things 

[?]
Nobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth
You're a child of The King
Never stop believing in yourself
The way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Stand up, stand up
And you can do anything
(Hallelujah)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm counting paper, rolling papers, watching time fly
California grapes, I'm breaking fine wine
Me I'm sky high, my bitch down to earth
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse
And I ain't slacking on the job my dog I been alert
Been gettin cake, ???
Big numbers round the neck so niggas show love
And these diamonds round my neck should make these hoes trust
On the road, at the venue filled with model hoes
College shows, smoking grade A honor roll
Bad broad, light skin
Hood niggas, white friends
And I ain't gotta talk much it's in your face
Give me brain, cuz she say she got expensive taste
Let her rub my tattoos now she flying
Smoking zig zags too, nigga rap like crack so I whip that

[Hook]
Whip it around
Whip it around
Whip it around
Watch it come back hard

[Verse 2: Calliko]
Country boy from Illinois yea I'm a pot head
Hydroponic you can spell through my pocket
It ain't tricking if you got it girl I got bread
Anybody feel like rolling up a blunt of kush?
I would but cheefing got me sleepy feeling good
Stiffer position, body stiffer than a brick of wood
Nice and neat, feeling like a trill nigga should
I'm addicted so consistent now roll up another
Light green Swisher Sweet and the castle is my suite
In the D, you know the room with the upstairs
When I'm powered up, add a couple blunts
Doing what I gotta do until a motherfucker up there
Up where? In the air you can't come up here
No bitch, only stunnas can come up here
Real playas do what ever that they want here
You punks scared, rolling down the window gettin air
Real niggas keep roaches in the ashtray
I introduce you to the life up in the fast lane
Moving quicker than Jamaicans at a track race
I be babysitting don't forget to tell me pass mane
Now break it down, roll it up
Break it down, roll it up
Calliko, Wiz Khalifa, roll up

[Hook]
Young Moolah baby!
You know we had to do a remix right?

(Hey lil' mama, hey hey lil' mama)

[Verse 1]
Hey lil' mama, fuck all that drama
Hop yo ass up in the drop
You know I had to turn it up, because the weather gettin' hot
They see me pull up to the spot
Now they jumpin' on my cock
They wanna li-li-li-li-lick me like a lollipop
Oh yessir, we gettin' gwap and we poppin'
We made you move, bass stopin
We know them losers be plottin'
But losing never a option
I pop the coop, with the invisible top
We be shutting niggas down in the parking lot
Oh fo sho
Her booty clapping and she make her pussie pop
I'm like Ray J with the camera
Later on we can watch
I'm like, I'm like oohhh, I'm a south side
Had the air high note
She singin' in auto tune like ooh, (like) ooh, (like) ooh, (like) baby, aaaahhhh
Yeah, I like that, I'm right back
Wherever them dykes at I like them girls that like them girls that like them boys
To put the whores on the right track
I pop the 6 with different chicks, in different kicks
I'm not like you snitching pricks
I like to do some different shit
You niggas wish you could spit it like Vic
Cuz, the whole bay be on my dick
Chorus

[Verse 2]

Hey lil' mama it's Carter, the boss
And I don't like my dick sticky so wipe off that lip gloss
Weezy baby bitch I don't mean no harm
But I swear I'm a goon, just like go on
I told her like a di-no-saur
Bitch they don't make 'em like me no more
So make history or leave my car
And since I be so high they think I'm fucking a star
I ain't gon' lie I be fuckin' some stars
Pussy so wet it get stuck in them draws
Then we fuck like retards
That pussy hot, she got a stick a hockey puck in her draws
And I be Wayne Gretzky
Take the bitch to South Beach and fuck her on a jet ski
Then it's bye lil mama
And now I'm all sick cuz I done ate her ill nana
I'm a nasty ass nigga, and every woman in the world like a nasty ass nigga
So here I am baby, fuck him baby
You want a family? Then you can swallow ten babies
Damone I'm gone but before I go
I don't love them hoes, Young Moolah, baby

[Intro]
Uh, yea
Let me warm up man, let me warm up man!
I got to warm up man!
Yea, Elite what up! Yeah Warm Up
Yeah, look

[Verse]
Niggas wanna know the formula for success
Shit, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest, boy please
Me I'm tryna stretch my treasure chest, like some double D breasts
So a nigga on a quest, no question
So I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed, hope to lay a niggas egg
No, you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone like Stockton, when he retired
Shit, your shit is fire, boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants, ha
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold up
That's cold-blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here, you can make it from heaven or hell
I'm just a little nigga straight out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew, with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you tryna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you tryna be
Look, it's no time to chill, I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill, I'm tryna build
Bitch there's no time to chill, I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill, I'm tryna build
Bitch there's no time to chill, I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill, I'm tryna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm tryna get Mills
There's no time to chill nigga, yeah
This next song takes something that's not that fun, math
And makes it, uh, offensive...

It's new math, yeah
What's a pirate minus the ship?
Just a creative homeless guy
And an anteater plus a large hungry mutant ant?
An ironic way to die
And what's domain, domain, range?
A kid with too much in his pants
And two balls minus one
Seven titles at the Tour de France, yeah

Gets worse

Yo, split a decision with long division
Take the circumference of your circumcision
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever ya get

It's new math
It's new math
And what's a bag of chips divided by five?
Well, that's a Nike worker's meal
And Santa clause multiplied by "i?"
Well I guess that makes him real
And the square root of the NBA is Africa in a box
How do ya trace a scatter plot?
Ya give the pencil to Michael J. Fox

Whatever

Take the approximate moral proportion of the probable problem of a pro-life abortion
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever ya get

It's new
It's new
It's new
It's new
It's new math

And if you took a factor tree of the factors that caused my girl to leave me
You'd have a tree
Full of Asian porn
C-A-L see you later
Mathematical minds make industrial smog
What's the opposite of ln(x)?
Duraflame the unnatural log
Support the farmers with a pro-tractor
Link Kennedy and Lincoln with a common factor
Live like your data, when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever ya get

It's new
It's new
It's new
Alright, word problems, ready?

If there's a fat guy in a pastry shop with a twenty dollar bill and he's ready to buy
In order to predict his volume change you'll need to know the value of pie
And there's a metal train that's a mile long and at the very back end a lightning bolt struck her
How long till it reaches and kills the driver, provided that he's a good conductor
And if ten percent of men are gay
Twenty percent of men are Chinese
What are the odds that a man chosen at random spends his free time and mealtime while on his knees?
And if Kim is half as old as Bobby
Who is two years older than twelve-year-old Tori
For how many more 30 day months will their threesomes be considered statutory rape?

'Cause math can be sexy

'Cause having sex is like quadratic expansion
If it can't be split then its time to stop
And having sex is like doing fractions
It's improper for the larger one to be on top
And having sex is like math homework
I do it best when I'm alone in my bed
And squaring numbers are just like women
If they're under thirteen just do them in your head
New math

[Intro: Mac Miller & Natasha Bedingfield]
Incom—, incom—, incom—, incom—, incompatible
(So a lot of people out here)
It don't matter though
(Tell me I don't belong in this rap game)
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
(Whether it be, um, too young)
Speak out if you do
(Not your everyday rapper)
You're not easy to find
(It's fucked up, but)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
They say I ain't ready for the game (For the game)
Well, that's a shame (That's a shame)
If you hatin', you can exit in your lane (Bye)
They jealous 'cause everybody mentionin' my name (Truth)
And all these other rappers, every sentence mean the same
But I'm spittin' with a diagnosed infection in my brain (Brain)
It sound crazy with this educated slang (Uh-huh)
So go ahead, keep your change
They say I don't belong here (Belong here)
Try and cut me out the field like a John Deere
I'm incompatible, probably 'cause I'm valuable (What?)
Lend me your ears with no collateral
If you don't give a fuck about me, everything cool
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you
Go and do what you do (What?)
Leave me to my music
Yeah, this can be your life if you choose it (Uh-huh)
I'm just doin' my part to write the history books
So why do all these other rappers keep givin' me looks?

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Natasha Bedingfield]
(They all say I'm) Incompatible (Haha)
It don't matter though (You know what I'm sayin')
(Jerm, just keep it goin')
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
(I'm just gonna do the second verse too)
Speak out if you do, you're not easy to find (Right)
Incompatible (Ayo, Sledgren, lemme talk to 'em real quick)
It don't matter though (Ready?)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, with all these expectations peakin'
They wonder what I'm 'bout to do ('Bout to do)
Sparked interest, music, I can count on you, right? (Right)
Or do I have it all twisted? (Twisted)
I went from popular to misfit in an instant
My friends forgot me 'cause they probably see me hardly (Damn)
Always in the lab when I should be out at a party (Truth)
It drive me crazy, and money is the fuel (Vroom)
Insomniac, awake, findin' somethin' I can do
To put the work in and I'm certain that I'm flirtin' with the fame
For failure gettin' jealous, throwin' dirt upon my name
It's burnin' up my brain but I'm workin' through the pain
'Cause life's hard 'til you learn it's just a game
Play your cards, use your letters on your Scrabble board (Play it right)
If you smart, put your heart into your rappin' more (Uh-huh)
No money? Why the fuck you countin' for? (I don't know)
A thousand chores, tryna get up my allowance more (Haha)

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Natasha Bedingfield]
Incompatible (But still they say)
It don't matter though
(I just tell 'em I'ma do me, ya know?)
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry (Hater can hate)
Speak out if you do (But I'ma make music)
You're not easy to find (Period)
Incompatible (The High Life)
It don't matter though (What?)
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry (Most Dope)
Incompatible

[Intro: Ludacris]
Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Check it! You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
"Word of Mouf," time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass

[Verse 2: 4-Ize]
These rap cats is soft like R&B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace
Lets do it

And Im good

You keep countin' that money, I'mma kill these niggas

[Big Sean]
Okay, Im young and rich, and this the shit man
What what, you you? you, you is a shit stain
Me im connected like I switched planes
Addicted to weed, bitches and big chains
Car so big Id crash if I switch lanes
Sayin' you the man nigga, quit playing
How you winning If I ain't switch teams
Bitch I had the same dream since I was sixteen
Rippin' life out of the plastic
Turnin' everything to platnuim
Got six rings do I look like Phil Jackson?
Meat Earl Mac and bunch of Tony Braxtons
Fill your cup to the f-f-fullest
Tell them if they actin' up and p-p-pull it
High off money, weed and, p-p-pussy
I didn't studder, so girl just d-d-do it right now

[Hook]
I used to seem to wonder what it feel like
Now I do what the fuck I feel like
Forever Reppin' When Im gone
I promise I'mma bring it back to home
And have my mother fucking weed rolled up and my champagne popping
I can't forget the girls, all around the world
Reppin' for my city, puttin' on with my crew
And I'mma keep this money just to blow it with them too

[Jwan]
And when I see you and the last time
I never lead a state where bags climb?
And this my city when Im in it nigga stand down
All of my niggas, a lot of money and bad broads
I stunt hard like I got a fucking sad car
Money will turn you evil, and that weed will have you nervous
But them bitches get you cute, and the pussy more potent
But I dont give a fuck, im stating callin hoes over
Mr. weedman meet me at my shows if you holdin'
A lot of niggas want it, and a lot of niggas chase it
But a lot of niggas die before they make
So while im getting money im gonna blow it like my papers
Where the fuck my bottles, where my mother fucking waitress, sorry darling are we clear?
Im standin' as a man till' im ruined
The worst thing you could do to me is shit I should be doing
And if a niggas fronting I take two and put it through him
Im no killer but I kill for what the fuck I am pursing. for real

[Hook]
Forever Reppin' When Im gone
I promise I'mma bring it back to home
And have my mother fucking weed broke down and my champagne popping
I can't forget the girls, all around the world
Reppin' for my city, putting on with my crew
And I'mma keep this money just to blow it with them too. Hey

[Verse 1]
Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And waste it on fixing all the problems
That you made in your own head

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my

[Verse 2]
Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother
Or else spend your days biting your own neck

[Chorus (Extended)]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

[Interlude]
Haa-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a
Ha-a-a-a-a

[Chorus (Extended)]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

[Verse 1]

I know I disappeared

And popped up in Pérès making chairs with a beard

And those that love me probably thought that it was weird

While the haters was happy

They thought my destiny was cleared

And any artist that you love have veered

Especially when they hated the image that they mirrored



I got a text that said P please get up

So like tron im brightly outlining my shit up
The penthouses, the homes, the cars, the chains

The stones

The admirers, mini me's, and clones

Selling you niggas dreams that are boxes full of foam



In and out of dimensions I walk through walls

Just sayin' you can't put me in a box thas all

No Da Vinci codes or Twilight stubs

Dont take this wrong but I like the taste of blood



Yo

[Verse 2]
So fittin, the sound in my system

Makes me wanna squish them

King kong foot

The beast has awakened

The protools tapin'

My position blatant

You knew I was coming

Trace this you waitin'

Now look up and ask why you've been forsaten



I shall hover

With splendid colors

That alone makes me other
Plus the, return of the jedi

I study how the brooklyn machine works

Thats word to big and his dead eye

I rise to the top like the sun

I rise to the pocket like a gun

I fire drop your body and its done



They like what happened?

We trapped them

Hatred is obliterated when I imagine

Look at you drowning in your lungs, gaspin'

Blood on the dancefloor, he, he Michael Jackson

Bitches should stay home, they do some much comin'

Y'all should stand back cause you do so much frontin'

Take this sunblock you got too much sunnin'

Now lets examine what you thinkin', running

Run too hard you might tear your meniscus

And if you try to run up, youll only get your wig split

This campaign we runnin is vicious

I hate to eat and run but this was delicious

[Chorus: 2D & San Fernandez Youth Chorus]
I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people who are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: San Fernandez Youth Chorus]
I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people who are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

[Verse: Bootie Brown]
In my backpack, I got my act right in case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken
With anger and discontent some are seeking
In search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box, six under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder
With lightning-fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
"The war is over", so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance

[Outro: San Fernandez Youth Chorus]
I need a gun to keep myself among

[Intro]
Ayo, Jerm
I think we got 'em here, man
Most Dope. Pittsburgh, what's good?

[Chorus]
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)

[Verse 1]
Hey, I kind of feel like I deserve this
Butterflies all up in my stomach like a first kiss
Just a wordsmith usin' poetry and more
But distracted by these girls who want their Juicy Couture
Yeah, this life is all about material things
I got kids tricks, bitch, I'm the cereal king
And everything better if you relax and chill
So my seat back for weed naps, we need that for real
I took my heart, put it all out on a CD
You now rockin' with the bees knees
I'm the, the cat's pajamas, the coolest of the cool
The kid that got 'em gassed, tappin', usin' up they fuel
When they first heard him spit, didn't think that it would be shit
M-O-S-T to the D-O-P-E kids
See you effin' H's, now you hangin' with a G, bitch
I want money, but they say I need Jesus

[Chorus]
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Flyer than a penguin, you dryer than a raisin
Hot like Cajun, bringin' all the girls to the Days Inn
Ready for a little love makin'
Yeah, I want it now, but they tell me, "Have some patience"
Feelin' on top of the world since graduation
Now I do music all day 'cause there ain't no other option
Drivin' to Connecticut, then flyin' up to Boston
I put it on for my city, always showin' love
And overdosin' drugs had the people throwin' up
They say, "What up?" when I drop in
I'm just chillin' back in my seat: Joe Swanson
Yeah, I used to steal iPods and pawn them
Now I take my girl shoppin', no problem
Live it up every second, life don't got a sequel
It's all good, thumbs up to my people

[Chorus]
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)
All my peoples, all of my peoples
Everything's a-okay (It's all good, baby)
Hey, we've been waitin' way too long
So tell the DJ can play my song (Put it on)

[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]

Because mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about
I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out
No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder
Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas
And if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees
We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest
And I shot those suckers, and I'll shoot the rest

Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Shhh-Snatching gold chains, nicking pieces of eight
I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
We got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties
Housing all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Taking out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL
Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat
Big biting suckers gettin' thrown in the moat
We got maidens and wenches - man, they're on the ace
Ah, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face
Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves

Torching and crackin' and rhymin' and stealin'
Robbin' and raping - busting two in the ceiling
I'm wheelin', I'm dealin' - I'm drinking, not thinking
Never cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking
Yo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey
And when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky
Skirt-chasin', free-basin' - killin' every village
We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage

Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

I was…
I've been drinking my rum - a def son of a gun
*I fought the law*, and I cold won
Blackbeard's weak - Moby Dick's on the chicks
'Cause I pull out the jammy, and I squeeze off six
My pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker
Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker
Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state
And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
And I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Most chillinest b-boy
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most killingest b-boy
I am most chill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most dustin'-out b-boy
I tossin' my dust
Most finkiest b-boy
I'm doin' that finkin'
Most rhyminest b-boy
I'm stretchin' my shade
Most shootinest b-boy
I think you're shit
Most rhyminest b-boy
I'll steal your shit, homeboy
Most taxinest b-boy
I tax you, boy
Most illingest, illingest, illingest b-boy
Waxin' all y'all squares
Yeah

[Hook - Mike Posner]
Sometimes my mind wanders away from me
I know
I light my dutchy up puff maybe one day I'll fly
Who knows? Who knows? Who knows? (I know)
Who Knows?(I know)

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
I wish that I could be what I want to
I wish that I would do what I don't do
I need a miracle; I hope it come through
I'm trying to work it out; I need a jumpsuit (damn)
Cause I don' 'bout had me enough of not havin' enough, slackin' and stuff
Mama on the phone not braggin' or nothin'
Cause her son ain't really got shit happenin' much
Saw my bank account like where is all the "O's" at?
Hit the club like where is all the hoes at?
Get a little change you gonna see how shit change
You gon' be up in the crib like where is all her clothes at?
And ask your girl she know it easy to say no to a nigga that's broke
But somebody with dough that got a little more?
Shit...I don't know

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
And I always had drive
Get's where I'm going if I ain't got a ride
And when they ask, "Do you do what you love?"
I'mma say, "I do" if I ain't got a bride
And I always kept Faith like B.I.G
Tryna do it big until my crib on Cribs
Man my girl ain't got to worry about shit
Cause our world is going be the shit
So she can tell her mom I'm a keeper
I am a dreamer, I could of been a king, huh
I'mma put my hands together like an applaud
And look upward, like what up Lord
I know if you try to you can turn these gray skies back to sky blue
Was made for the give and go like a drive-thru
Give us opportunity and see what we do with it

[Hook]

[Verse]
More than feelings get hurt when the shotty goes
Blow, ears get fucked from my audios
I get more ass than potty holes
Had these naughty flows ever since I was a snotty nose
Youngin, mobbin’ with my shirt tucked in
I’ll pop a nigga in his mouth to show him I wasn’t bluffin’
But, things changed like a Barack Campaign ad
Niggas on the sneak tip I see you clearly through these Ray-Bans
Wait, now my erections go "pshh" down the necks of hoes
Who next to go? The flexible bisexual, I’m thinkin’ so
What’s perplexin’, though, is that this adolescent's flow
Is hotter than a motherfuckin’ summer spent in Mexico
Cop me a mic, check and go, prepare for domination
I got more flavors than a calm doctor has patients
Cut to the race, I’ll come in first place
Respect me or catch a Nike SB to the face
Now, I whooped so many niggas that they callin’ me racist
I annihilate them, my flows amazing as grace is
Ask them motherfuckers locked up in my basement
I won’t give a shit, fuck, once your face hit’s the pavement
A hater only flatters me
Who's up to bat? We bastards, we savage, y'all handle more balls than Agassi
Nobody passes me, Fantastic 3 plus 1
Leave catastrophes wherever we run, umm
Hun, pardon the casualties
Lyrically you can’t pass me
Nigga tryna pass me got slapped like a black chicks ass cheek
I’m cold make the track sneeze, breakin’ niggas like bad knees
I got sweet steeze, so sweet I attract bees
With my, brainiac flows, the zaniest hoes know
I hit niggas playin’ me with low blows
To keep your eyes wide shut like a No-Doz
I cop dough and stay afloat when I show boat, nigga

[Intro]
Choose the sword and you will join me
Choose the ball and you join your mother in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
So, come boy, choose life or death

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
What the fuck is being humble about? I got the flows
And the shows and the hoes and the clout, so what you talkin' about?
Bathin' Ape by the bundle, no campin' out
With the camp put death to the trash y'all puttin' out
I remember wearin' them all red Vandals
Had them bitches ham when I jammed in a Tan Camry
Since I was 16 I had dreamed of them red Lambos
Success ain't open for me? I'm pickin' the damn handle
For an example, I'm as hot as a damn mantle
Fire when I spit, shit drip like lit candles
Bitches lying and crying, I hit cancel
Hard on my hoes, I'm only nice on this pencil
Handsome, dashing, with the calligraphy
And this is prolly an H now if it is a G
Free Earl I'm screamin' 'til we get to see
Odd Future motherfuckin' Wolf Gang history

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Eat a cock and cum mayonaisse ham sandwich
I do harm hammers relaxin' on a hammock
Flow damage, understood Mom's Spanish
I handle it, contain a rock Cal Cambridge
Ever since I got my crew, David and Clancy to manage it
And cuttin' through these tracks, Domo providin' the bandages
Wolf Haley torch the flamethrower
Mike G, bitches askin' him for money like he is the bank owner
Left Brain extract bitches mind and give 'em left brain
Soft synths, hard drums, give your bird chest pains
Ask Syd where we at, she tell you where we goin'
To free Earl from the fuckin' Samoans
If I was a pussy I would be Amanda Knox
Cause I'm homicide prone and I isn't gettin' caught
In a courtroom file ten council lawsuits
I'm fuckin' a judge so none of the laws fall through

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like "Momma
This air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly"
I hit that court, and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
"I touched the net! Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life"
Air Max's were next, that air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
At school, I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their Adidas
On the court, I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
Stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his Fours
Whoa

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
I was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right, wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this is that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me "Be a consumer"
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
"Are you stupid? Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!"
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes

[Hook]
Got goals, got dreams, Im infatuated with nice things
I love money, it might seem
This is my desire want and need

[Verse 1]
All I do is eat shit and think about success
Cause man,I done have enough stress
But I beat every obstacle they put up
Im back against the wall like a stove so I cook up
I've always been the best at every single thing I took up
So I feel extra bad for the challenges they hooked up
(D-Town)Come and make a visit to the (West Side) if I need to be specific
If I ever up in court best believe I plead the fifth and they headed to the club bartender bring a 50
These niggas bitches swear to god they PMS'ing
Im just chillin' with my family, Mr. Peter Griffin
And my girl look better than yours
And Im the only thing lookin better than her
Yeah, and Im just tryin to make a million off recordin'
Psychic read my fortune, said Id be worth a fortune

[Hook]

[x2]

I learned at a young age you gotta grind for it
We been waitin' all day n night for it
It seems like we've been waiting all our life for it
Some niggas will take a life for it
But Ima say it I did it all legitimate
Then put my niggas on it just to say I was considerate
Race to success and Im like where the competition went?
The musics runnin' bitch and it never tore a ligament
Niggas comin up to me like Sean I beg your pardon
B-I-G, but how much is you chargin?
Runnin' up to me for they buzz like a barber
And all that weak shit just make mine sound harder
And Ima live this life till Im gone
Only people that could give you life is a judge and God
But the only one that judge me is my God
So Ima live life like fuck what you thought

[Hook]

[x2]

[Bridge]
This is what I live for
This is what I die for
This is what I stayed up every single night for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I live for
This is what I die for
This is what I stayed up every single night for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I waited my whole life for

[Hook]

I'ma be a brother, but my name ain't Lehman
I'ma be ya bank, I'll be loaning out semen
Honeys in debt, baby bouncing them checks
But I don't really mind when they bouncing them cheeks
I'ma be, I'ma be, I'ma-ba, I'm-I'ma be rich, baby
I'ma be, I'ma be, I'm-I'ma be
Sick with the flow when the goal is to rock the whole globe
I'ma be the future, I'ma be the whole
Reason why you even wanna come to a show
You can see me while I'm rockin' and I'm kickin' down a door, then

[Bridge: will.i.am]
I'ma be up in the club
Doin' whatever I like
I'ma be popping that bubbly
Coolin' and livin' that good life
Oh, let's make this last forever
Partying, we'll chill together
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
I'ma be rocking like this (What?)
Y'all niggas wanna talk shit (But)
Why don't you put it on the blog, nigga?
Rockin' like this is my job, nigga
We can't help that we popular
And all these folks wanna flock to us
Come to a show and just rock with us
A million plus with binoculars

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie, (Fergie)]

[Intro]
I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
"Listen, listen"

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 1]
You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me (Ooh)
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

[Chorus]
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

[Verse 2]
Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good, yeah

[Chorus]
Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
You wanna be high for this

[Outro]
For this
You wanna be high for this
Ooh, woah
You wanna be high for this, yeah
You wanna be high for this

[Intro: T-Pain]
Goddamn, lil mama

Matter fact, after the club, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Me and my niggas gon' be together, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Mike Jones & T-Pain]
(Chea, Mike Jones!)
She's every man's dream, she's God's gift to Earth
Women they love 'em too, that's what you call a woman's worth
See I love all the strippers, because they show me love
They know I never pay, it's free whenever I hit the club
But I can't even lie, the girls out here so fly
She slidin' up and down that pole, got me mesmerized
Mike Jones don't ever trick, but goddamn she thick
I can't lie, I must admit (I'm in love with a stripper)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl, I'm stayin, I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl, I'm stayin, I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
She can pop it, she can lock it
Teddy Pend-Her-Ass-Down
Is bout to see this sexy girl (in my bed)
She don't know what she is doin' (to my head)
Yeah, she turnin' tricks on me (yea yea yea)
She don't even know me (yea yea yeah)
But I done got her over to my crib to do that night thing
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

[Chorus: T-Pain]
She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl, I'm stayin, I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl, I'm stayin, I'm in love with a stripper
Ayo
Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile
It must hurt to sell your album off PayPal
'Specially when you in the game 15, 20
You was hot when Shaq teamed up with Penny
Man, you was magic!
I mean, look at you now, ho, you just tragic!
You a tragedy, you a parody
Last name Ann, first name Raaaaaaggggedy
These goofy bitches is stupidity personified
Ayo, Wayne, you want it gully, or the Gaza side

[Hook]
If you trying to come over
I can keep leave the door open
And naw I ain't with the bullshit
So let me know if you fucking, girl
See you been running around my mind for some time
And it's the way I feel, for real

[Verse 1]
I'm the one the bad broads report to
So every time we leave the club my whole car full
Buncha bitches in the back; carpool
They all wet, so now I'm riding in the car pool
But I could never take 'em where I live
Gotta be my baby if you laying in the crib
But they all get the hotel presidential
But to make it there swear you gotta have potential
Face like a model, waist like a pencil
Treat my dick like an eating utensil
She said, "I'm tryna do what you do"
I told her that I do me
She said, "Well, let me do you"
Plus you know I'm rapping and all
Now we finna cut
I'mma prolly need some alcohol after all
Me and my niggas all up-and-coming
So they gon' try to get us up and cumming
We all running

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yes sir, yes ma'am, had a thousand fall outs and one night stands
And dawg when it come to night stands I done had more night stands than the fucking Art Van
So partin' when she's in my apartment
I'm trying to skip from part two all the way to part ten
She's in my pockets like she tryna get checked or something
And I'm just trying to hit her back like I left some
Smoke some, drink some, lemme spank some
And I don't mean the time when I say threesome
And bet I her make her walk with a limp
Gold 'round my neck like a motherfuckin' champ
Rock Bathing Ape like a motherfuckin' chimp
And bet I cock tail like a motherfuckin' shrimp
So yeah I'mma leave the door open
All night pokin' till my dick broke in, bitch!

[Hook]
What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
What if I kissed you right now...

Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...

...admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now
Just be mine (just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine
And u just be mine (just, just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine

[Verse 1: Tyler]
The Supreme tee is kinda dingy
Pass the fucking puffer, nigga stingy with the Usher, let it burn
Skate session with my niggas
On a cloud, where's my inhaler, I can't even breath
I don't smoke weed
But I'm on a cloud high enough to give me a nose bleed
Say farewell to the brain cells, neutrons can smell us
My niggas keep enough green to get a bush jealous
Roll tighty, the joint righty, go buy a label
And busters don't get the zimper in Chris Lighty, alrighty
Or maybe a swisher, I begin to kiss her
Keepin' all the arms and limbs in a large bin
My niggas keep mary jane like a fucking Tarzan
In the fuckin toilet where my bars been
They been the shit since Riley figured out she really likes Dark men
Domo hitting bowls, nuggets size of coals
Rolling a whole 'nother blunt the size of a troll
Davon on paroll, so if the highway patrol
Sees us strolling to 7-11 to get a Arizona
And some donuts, he'll be in a hole, but we're not gonna let it happen
Im not talking music when I say were the best at wrapping
The kush, coke, Ritalin, and mushroom caps in my system, um

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I break number 2 pencils cause I write so strong
Tyler rolling up a stick so when it lights, so long
Brass monkey, clarinet, ten drop in the gong
Gas mask, vaporizer, tranquilize you with the bong
Imagine gas and 'laxing, puff passing past tense
Future kush, cool tour, poke your arms blue or
Dream, smoke white like vanilla bean ice cream
Besides OF, Mary Jane and me make a nice team
Pause, aw you getting too fat, bitch
Munchies, gaining weight is fucking automatic
Can't fit into the plus size of that sack's fifth
She get high, get down on hot dogs and pick up the cat bitch
The powder is packed in the straw, Sammy claim he like chowder
Nostrils are allowed to scream white power
Overdose in a quince then detox, she rocks
Got em sweating like they inhaling on she cops
And we the drug, and we the drug, and we the drug
Bitch I'm high as fuck, just let it sing to you

[Verse 3: Domo]
I stay in the sky so there's no way you can get fly as me
Niggas wish that some point in their life they'll get high as me
Never though, got a dorm room filled with hella smoke
With towels under the door hoping no one outside smell the dro
Fuck it, I'm blazing up, bad bitch craving dust
So I passed it to her last thing she’ll see before waking up
Strong dank leave your main bitches with throat aches
One of em half bakeing, half dressed cause her clothes stank
Rolling paper skills, it's the time I showcase
So rush down, bitches want a star beat like old Bapes
Where Davon at? cause he can Zieir too
Big Cam Lawrence kid, you can even call Lionel
Tyler dog, hit it once for the game
Give it to Hodgy Beats then dish it off to the Brain
My eyes heavy, someone give me a orange juice
Louie V shades so my thoughts don't support you
Thoughts decreases, hunger builds in my torso
Paper plane on paper plane, can I please aboard you
You, you, uh, ayo Vyron, light that one

[Bridge]
Kush, coke, X, mushroom
I'm high as fuck

[Verse 4: Tyler]
I'm Atheist, so I let the blunt bless her
Higher then a fat nigga bitch blood pressure
On the dresser is the kush compressor
That four cents of bags of fluorescent flower pedals
Take a hit of this shit, inviting some
Bitches over to the crib, take a sniff, feeling numb
Baby girl, this is love, mixed with coke
And the eighty proof is in the pudding, so is a pint of cum
This is fun, don't you even try to run
Get you high, get you drunk, oh wait, you're not even real
This is fucking fake, snow white is in my nasal
I don't even think I'm able to shimmy passed the table
Without tripping on cables, me and Travis crying
Earl is probably dying, Cedric licking walls
And all of us tripping balls, heart beating in a trance
I'm in a submissive stance, I'm not fucking playing
When I say call the ambulance, shit

[Outro]
Call the fucking ambulance
I can't feel me, call the.. I can't fucking breathe
I'm not fucking.. this isn't.. What the fuck is this he..
Yo call the ambulance, my heart is beating too fast
I'm bout to.. Open a fucking window

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice"
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 3: Punch]
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
Yes

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
And oh

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though."
My only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down

[Interlude: Female Voice Speaking]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar. what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, is this really you?
Is this who you are? What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be frontin'
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, "Will the radio care?"
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
But I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word

[Outro: Female Voice]
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Uh, just bought a condo downtown, high as fuck
27th floor, all the bitches down to fuck
Big donkey butt, Ciroc coconut
Big gulps, drink it all like a Slurpee cup
Brain freeze, iced like a hockey puck
London town, Westwood, what the fuck is up?
Just checked my account, another hundred thou’
Niggas sendin’ me money like I’m PayPal
Wait pal, pow pow, 40 cal
Smith & Wesson, make a wrestler whistle loud
I’m in the grocery store, can’t even walk the aisles
Ya girls see me, nah, I’m takin’ pictures with a smile
Sunlight reflectin’ off my gold skin
Last King killing everything you dressin’ in
Blacks, Mexicans say, when your shit goin drop?
I tell em, Careless World probably gon’ make the world stop
Vibrate your soul, make your pussy pop
Presidential suite, tip the bell hop
I speak a language of money, like casinos
Spitting my phlegm on pictures birds and eagles
I’m on a mission to Mars, Don Cheadle
I’m a legend to ya’ll ordinary people
From Hollywood to Cerritos
The black beatles, and I ain't even got a single
And living single, all my diamonds seem clear
Louie trunks in my living room bitches stare
Who is this young? how’d he manage to make it here
The future is ours, robotic sports car
Paid for, therefore, beach chair just chillin'
I don’t eat pork and I’ve never tried chitlins
It's hard living in hell, why should demons avail?
Turn into a human shell
Hate you cause they hate themselves
Hah, blood thinner, poppin’ pills to stay balanced
On or off the road, everyday's a challenge
I need a studio, book me room, a palace
I gotta go its gettin’ late and I ain't got my license
Cop pull me over and shit, asking why I was driving reckless
I told him I’m I was a rapper, look at my watch
Still gave me a ticket though

Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized
Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized
Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized
Open your mind

[Verse 1]
It's 'bout to be big shit poppin' by the time this shit is droppin'
Stoppin' not a option, I'm addicted, it's a problem
This way of life, sex, drugs, rock and roll, on the road
Feelin' blessed, performin' for sold-out shows
You rappers talkin' shit, what you know 'bout those?
What you know 'bout spittin' bars and the whole crowd goes? (Yeah)
It's unbelievable, these people say I made it
Throwin' down a little Henny, can't believe that I don't chase it
Life goes on, days get brighter
I'm feelin' like I came in with my haze, no lighter
So I'm lookin' for the missin' piece
Goin' down in history for rippin' beats
Smooth game, sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
You tune into my station, hope you listening
Turn it up and follow on my journey as I live my dream
All-natural Whole Foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is happy like a show tune
This a brand new world, I can show you (Yeah)
Some people still have no clue
But they can look at all this cheese that I produce

[Chorus]
In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)
In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)

[Verse 2]
Hey
Ayo, I'm fast lane switchin', rap game spittin'
Chillin' with some sour, got a bad dame twistin' (Yeah)
These people think I'm goofy, say I'm Max, they trippin'
'Cause life a comedy like my last name Griffin
Livin' for the moment, blowin' potent, overloaded
And my swagger, call me Old Spice
Yeah, the kid is so nice
Smokin' in the whip, chillin', duckin' from the po-lice
So bright, you no lights, I'm shinin' like a strobe light
Leave a show with money, and I always count my dough twice
Most Dope general, and that shit is fo' life
My mama taught me well, so I even treat these hoes right, I'm po-lite
Workin' in my office, but no Dwight
Coke-white skinded, no light dimness
Me, who I am, plain sight for these bitches (Yeah)
And I ain't even tryna fight with these bitches
I don't got time to spend a night with these bitches

[Chorus]
In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)
In a world (I am so happy,) that go round, you up or you down
You in or you out, you smile or you frown
Just get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up), get up (Get up)

[Outro]
Yeah

[Intro: B.o.B]
I met a little shawty on a Wednesday night
And she was chillin’ in the VIP
I said hey girl wha-what’s you name?
She just smiled and it was over

[Hook One: B.o.B]
Cause I just wanna use your love tonight (yeah yeah yeah)
And I just wanna work you girl all night

[Verse One: B.o.B]
My girl was on vacation so out in microwavin’
So I went out late chasin’ and met a girl mixed with Asian
I don’t wanna seem impatient so I told her its late forget a date
And B.o.B wanna lay it and that’s the truth just face it
And don’t get mad and angry you know you ready ain't ya?
You lightin’ cigarettes up ‘cause you are very anxious
And ‘cause I was a stranger now your legs in the ai-r
Some may call me a player ‘cause the way I treat females ‘cause

[Hook Two: Outfield sample] + (B.o.B)
I-I just wanna use you love tonight
(So baby please don’t leave me waitin’)
I-I don’t wanna lose your love tonight
(So baby please don't leave me hangin’)

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Oh no no no please don’t tell me that you about to go go go
They know you like my swagger how I roll roll roll
So don’t you get there action’ like your so so cold
‘cause I ain’t here to chase you down (yeah yeah yeah)

[Hook One]

[Verse Two: B.o.B]
Yeah you know I’m so bud
Uh I’m so, I’m no love
My homies don’t trust
Plus the four months
And don’t the she bed
A rope that’s from head
And so she like bud
I’m wrapped in more
Lookin’ at a body like yours
And I’m tryna get some oral
Think young lady named Dora
But ain't really talkin’ on a girlfriend scale
You already know what world this is
Sorry if your feelings get hurt my dear
I send you a text when your birthdays here
Just stay there here’s a little donation, and I'll see you on the next occasion
Just don’t be everywhere I relocate ‘cause I don’t need probation

[Hook Two]

[Intro]
Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is "You Idiot" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Bridge]
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

[Chorus]
This is stupid (No, no), I'm not stupid (No, no, no)
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Like I'm stupid)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Outro]
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love

[Intro: Dash Snow, Daniel Joseph & Kendrick Lamar]
"I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in."
"So what keeps you alive?"
"Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing."
Thank you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me "Rap about life, not rap niggas"
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to "Faith," and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, "The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?"
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough)

[Outro: Alori Joh]
We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD. Because of you we are Overly Dedicated

[Produced by The Roots]
Wake up and see just what, what could be
My life as, as good as it ever be, ever be
Close, close my mind, to the outside light
I’m fuck fucked up and I can’t leave, can’t leave

You can’t, can’t be, where I,I be
Follow me and you’ll see and you’ll see
You can’t, can’t see, what I, I see
Follow me and you’ll be free, you’ll be free

So hard to cope it hurt, hurt my hope
My pride deep inside is fading slow
Fall, fall asleep my brain runs at speeds
I’m lost, lost in dreams and reality, reality
Please save me Lord, my life is such a chore
But I, I need this to be ok, be ok

What, what they think of me it ain’t no thing
My heart, heart is broke completely

[Hook]
Take time, and see where I’m at
Take, take, take time and see where I’m at

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

[Hook]

[Intro]
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Overlapping voices)

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 5]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me
(We're deep in the fire)

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(We're deep in the fire)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(I'm here to remind you)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(Don't you sit back and watch the beatin')
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about-
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about-
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(Hee-hee, woohoo!)

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
Nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby
Nothin' on YOOOOOOOOOU, baby

[Lupe Fiasco]
You already know where my heart be at
Tempo that my heart beat at, boom boom
That for you, for real, for truth
There's never been trivial pursuit
May look like a sedan man but I'm really just a coupe
Now that's two, so they can't fit, there's no room
And there's no roof, so there's no limitation
Limitless, since it's initiation
And to the crew, seed sown, then it grew
Was a pilot now we in syndication
And every time we show up this Pay-Per-View
Or the news, you're my satellite, that Youtube (tell 'er!)

[Hook]

[Lupe Fiasco]
On my microphone hustle, stay behind the bar
And I thought I could never be imprisoned
This the story of how you caught me slippin'
That's right, locked up abroad
You remain, they mirage, they collapse, we collage
We stick together like we starting fires
Thick as thieves, pick pockets at large
Kinda like lame miserab's
But we don't play, Broadway's for the stars
She's venus, and me's mars, so we like on a whole 'nother chart
Surreal, it's like a whole 'nother art
Hanging at the moment, and we got our names on the A-train cars
Like freedom meets cars, coming down banging knocking pictures off the walls

[Hook: Bruno Mars]

[Lupe Fiasco]
So what more? Further I could go into
But what for? We're already killing them
We're like Williams and Woods on tour
Now that's love above par, ooh
I just love to love ya'll, you're my power
My peace, my elegant flowers
No matter what the world is coming to
I take the rap, they got nothin' on…you

[Lupe Talking Over Hook]
Heh..you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, temptation is a mother
But you're like none other
They can't compare
's why I'm here, you know?
It's like FOR-ever, that's like a long time (haha)
Yeah, the vibrations are very nice on this one
Lupe, let's go…PEACE!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Intro: Jorma]
Ayo, new Lonely Island, 2011
Let's get 'em, 'Kiv!

[Verse 1: Akiva]
Ayo, my dick don't work, that shit as soft as a pillow
My girly lookin' at me like, “You for real, dude?”

[Break: Jorma]
Ayo, hold up, hold up, we gotta come harder than that
Yo, tell 'em, Andy

[Verse 2: Andy]
I think there might be something wrong with my dick
It's like a melted stick of butter, so soft that it can't fill the rubber

[Break: Jorma]
Aye yo, come on man, this is Lonely Island
People are countin' on us
I gotta run all these motherfuckers myself, woo!

[Verse 3: Jorma]
Ayo, I think I broke my dick in the sink
It's so small and ugly, all smashed and flat, like it was playing rugby

[Break: Jorma]
Hold up, hold up, this is serious!
Kiv let 'em know!

[Verse 4: Akiva]
Yo, for real though, I suffer from stinky dick
Every time I take a piss, it smells just like shit

[Break: Jorma]
Haha, yeah, that's what I'm talking 'bout!
Andy show 'em, how it's done!

[Verse 5: Andy]
My dick looks like the fat that you cut off a steak
Smashed in like my balls went and stepped on a rake

[Break: Jorma]
Lonely Island! Grammy nominated!
Yeah! Hit 'em again

[Verse 6: Akiva]
Yo, straight out the box with my soggy little shrimp
I was an eight year old girl before the doctor found my dick

[Break: Jorma]
We make too much money for this shit
Murder music!

[Verse 7: Andy & Jorma]
I shit the bed 'cause my dick played a prank on my butt (Hit 'em!)
Straight crept when I slept and stuck a laxative up

[Break: Jorma]
Suppository music!
What y'all know about incontinence?

[Verse 8: Akiva & Jorma]
I got Hepatitis C from a horse, but no confusion (Yeah!)
It wasn't from the sex, it was a blood transfusion!

[Break: Jorma]
What?! Motherfucker got horse blood! What y'all got?!

[Verse 9: Andy & Jorma]
I write freaky fan fiction where cartoons fuck
Got CGI Garfield lickin' Marmaduke's nuts (woo!)

[Break: Jorma]
I would like to see that! This is that Garfield sex music!
Now y'all just showin' off, preach!

[Verse 10: Akiva]
I got a friend named Reggie who lives down at the dump
Every other week, I swing by and bring him some lunch

[Outro: Jorma]
Oh, now that just sounds nice!
I'ma call it right there, game over, motherfuckers!
Lonely Island, we started this fake rap shit!
The world needs us!

[Verse 1]
Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like

[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

[Belly]
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up

[Refrain]
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

Akon, Konvict Konvict
Ah-ah-ah-ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh
Konvict music, yeah

[Verse 1]
The pressure's buildin' up (Oh), I feel like givin' up (Oh)
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up?
When everything has changed (Oh), it'll never be the same (Oh)
Nobody knew me then, now everybody knows my name
And I feel so ashamed
I never been the kind of nigga that would complain
But it's so crazy, man
It's no different, every day, it's just the same thing
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin', feelin' like it's gonna explode
And I just wanna know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know

[Chorus]
What's got me insane?
Ohh, 'cause I can't stand the rain
Ayy, it's hitting my window pane a little too much
And now I gotta let you know
What's got my face in a frown?
Ayy, 'cause I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Ohh, the thunder that's crashing down upon my house (Ayy)
'Cause now I gotta let you know

[Verse 2]
Now I got no more worries now (Now), my pocket's fatter now (Now)
Look in the mirror, my reflection looks different now
You're gettin' bigger, Akon, you need to settle down
Why do I feel this way?
Should I be happy or should I just ignore
Everything that I've been given? Please help me Lord
It's all over, but I can't escape the rain
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin', feelin' like it's gonna explode
And now I gotta let you know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know

[Chorus]
What's got me insane?
Ohh, 'cause I can't stand the rain (Can't stand it)
Ayy, it's hitting my window pane (Can't stand it), a little too much
That's why I gotta let you know
What's got my face in a frown? (Yeah)
Ayy, 'cause I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Ohh, the thunder that's crashing down (That's crashing down), upon my house

[Outro]
Said now whoa diddy whoa diddy whoa

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside your mirror, clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen?
There must be fifty ways to make a record
He's up inside the clubs, they like to lean and rock, oh
Stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw, now he asks me
How he can make hit songs to reach the top
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Fifty ways to make a record

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi & Paul Simon]
You got talent and your soul cannot be bought
He looked and smiled at me and told me "Thanks a lot"
See, I could use your help
And would you please explain about the fifty ways?
It's kind of easy if you have a open mind
This game is more than spending money and fuckin' dimes
It's all within your words, some shit that outlives time
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Fifty ways to make a record

[Verse 1]
The only girl I ever loved
Fucked some nigga that I really hate
And the funny part about it that we didn't even date
But at the end she could still say she got her pussy ate
Yummy her in her tummy, pour out cause
Cummy in her bummy means that a little me being coming
So I let her blow my flute and start humming, bitch's brewin'
But that wasn't bubble gum that she was chewin'
Our relationship was like my music, chopped up, screwed up
Made her sick threw up, I gave her everything that wasn't enough
So I put two up, I'm hot, she cool, I call it a blue crush
We fucked, no kiss, that's it, fuck love
Snort drugs, make songs, go skate, daily life
Sarah or Dorothy, which one to make my wife
Or maybe I'll just marry both of them bitches, maybe twice

[Hook]
I was in love, but fuck it

[Outro]
Dorothy, my everything
She was my everything
Sarah, I love you
O.F.M. bangin' in your muthafuckin' FM, Tyler the Creator

[Hook]
There’s a bad bunch of bitches r-r-rolling with me on my side
I know I gotta choose ‘em when bitches look me in my eyes
Wordplay so slick, I can change a nun’s mind
Hit them with this pimpin’ now you feeling like it's the first time
I’m talking real real pimpin’, babe
(I’m talkin’ real pimping)
I’m talking real real pimpin’, babe
(I’m talkin’ real pimping)
I’m talking real real pimpin’, baby (Mhmm)
(I’m talkin’ real pimping)
I’m talking real real pimpin’, baby, aw yeah (Yo, yo)

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
I heard you was the beach and I’m looking to get wet
You fucking with the keys and I play the clarinet
I guess you musta heard I’m the baddest bitch around
So it is going down like a mother fucking frown
And this is going up when you see me in my skirt
When they see me, I go urr, leave them bitches in the dirt
When they see me, they go “ohh, yeah, bitch there puts in work”
And I’m fucking with the P (?), so I make that pussy squirt
Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt, I’mma make that pussy squirt
If you want it, come and get it, you can have it for dessert
You can eat it with some cherries like you eating Ben and Jerry’s
And uh-uh, this isn’t scary, this is very necessary

[Hook]
There’s a bad bunch of bitches r-r-rolling with me on my side
I know I gotta choose ‘em when bitches look me in my eyes
Wordplay so slick, I can change a nun’s mind
Hit them with this pimpin’ now you feeling like it's the first time
I’m talking real real pimpin’, babe
(I’m talkin’ real pimping)
I’m talking real real pimpin’, babe
(I’m talkin’ real pimping)
I’m talking real real pimpin’, baby

[Intro]
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Know what I mean, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the—

[Verse]
Hollering at this Japanese girl, Asian mommy
But is it too soon for Japanese girls? Too tsunami?
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame?
Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me
(What the fuck is up?) Yeah, it's Cheezy, ho
I'm so cheesy, ho, my swag's got high cholesterol
I know y'all girls, I met them all, you're her ex-man like Cannonball
I ain't got shit to say to ya, I'm known for bad behavior
Look at me, man, I went to the W from Double Tree
Makin' out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee
Can I live up to all this hype they have for me? It's hard to tell
But these girls I'm kissin' chase the blues away like Gargamel
I'm back in the game, coach put me in
T-Pain flow, all I do is win
With a glass full of Macallan to mess me up
And the cash we can throw at them unless we fuck
Dopeness, after this, I hit the highway
I'm headin' west like I'm fuckin' blowin' Kanye
Read the fuckin' news, Huey Lewis, nigga
You can't go H.A.M, you's a Jewish nigga
Donald Glover, you don't have to call me "Childish"
Except for when I'm flirting with your half-Latino stylist
Photoshoot, beach house playin' Beach House, free wireless
So I can post these pictures on my website of her smilin'
I kissed this girl I've liked since back when I was just a sophomore
But I'm afraid to text her "What the fuck it take so long for?!"
What the fuck has changed? Is it swagger? Is it money?
I still dress the fuckin' same and my nose is still as ugly as the day you fuckin' met me
They're tellin' me I'm the rapper for these white kids
'Cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit
I wanna bring you back to the studio, try and get your number
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their Tumblrs
I like it when you tweet me, you smell like baby lotion
I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean
Her pussy tastes like vanilla, tasty ho
Clown niggas, then I kill 'em, Gacy flow
It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick
I'm Pryor in his last years: comedian who's sick
Fuck, but I am sick, seriously
I don't feel so good, 'cause I don't get sleep
And I'm always travelin', and I don't go home
And my friends don't call, 'cause I turned off my phone
I've made mistakes, I bumped my head
Inside of this girl, inside of my bed
Whatever, man, I'm just havin' fun
I'm sorry that I fucked her, but now you know that she's not the one
I'm doin' you a favor, like every time I rhyme
Or write a script or do a movie, there's a million ways to shine
Choose one instead of what you're doing tonight
IAMDONALD, coming soon, we've got all of the lights
All of the lights

[Outro]
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Know what I mean, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the—
Man, I ain't got nothing but some pussy and some paper
I keep a bad bitch like a muthafucking Laker
I don’t love them hoes, fuck that pussy till its aching
Pass a bitch like Troy Aikman
Man, gangstas don’t die, gangstas go to Vegas
We don’t need no navigation, we go where the money takes us
Muthafucking fools, like the first of fucking April
I ain't never been a pussy, have you ever been in pussy?
Thats so muthafucking good, feel like a treasure in a pussy
I’m a shovel in a pussy, or devil to them pussy
Spill the champagne on them pussies
Yeah, same shit different restroom
Stop playing, I turn your chest into a flesh wound
Ha, you would never guess who's in my guest room
Now they saying "just me Tune!"

[Hook]
Tunechi, that what they call me man
Big dog muthafucker, you’s a Pommerain
They say fuck me, then Karma came
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name
In my momma name…guns in my momma name
And since my case, I got my guns in my momma name

[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]
I’m smoked out, I’m by myself
Bitch, I’m a king no matter how the cards are dealt
It’s Young Money or it’s take money
Long hair don’t care, call me jake sully
Pay me or pay for me
I tell em hoes stay on ya toes, ballet for me
Momma pray for me
Goons spray for me
I have em bring me your head on a tray for me
Cut the brain raw, pussy ass nigga I’m at your chest like a training bra
Tune talk that shit that rip straight through the kevlar
Pull a bitch over, dump his ass in a reservoir
Real nigga repertoire
Add five or six blunts to the head, it helps
Reportin’ live from the top of the food chain
We eatin man, now what my name?
Tunchi, yep! That what they call me man

[Gudda Gudda]
Gudda Gudda, double G, it’s all the same
The game ain't never been the same since the Carter came
And I stay high bitch, fly like the largest plane
You Captain save a ho, cuffin like a sargeant man
Duck tape on the handle of my pistol nigga
And I don’t spit no more I drew like a retarded man
Shawty on my lap, watch me pump pump up the party man
Don't you hold a grudge cause your bitch chose me, I’m sorry man
Young nigga with old school, game like an Atari man
Thats your ho callin’ man
I’m Gudda Gudda bitch, thats what they call me man
Ohhh yeah, dada, dodo, dada, dodo, dada, dodo, Akon

Life come and go
So let the history be told
We're all out here

Why don't you pick yourself up now (pick yourself up now)
You see we all out here
Working day by day

So tell me

On that day when its time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow
How can we work it out
When good and evil meet
The day you kiss his feet
Cause it will soon come

You soon lose track of which way is up when your always being put down (being put down)
You gotta be strong and do what you feel in your heart
Regardless of who's around (regardless of who's around)
I know it might seem bold
But thats all we have (all we have)
Many centuries and we're steady gettin old
But you know to what we never had
Sooo

On that day when its time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow

When good and evil meet
The day you kiss his feet
Cause it will soon come

How can we work it out

Cause it will soon come (yeah)
How can we work it out
On that day when its time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow (that pot of gold)

When good and evil meet
The day you kiss his feet

Presidents in my wallet, no rules, I'm 'bout it

Yo! It's PB! PB! Who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago, I renewed my license
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that?
You can suck a dick, you can suck on a ballsack
No, no, I don't endorse that, pause that, abort that
Just the other day mi go a-London, saw dat
Kids down di street, paparazzi, all dat
Hey hey, what can I say?
Day day day da-day day
Coming through the club, all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football, why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
Really, I peeped dude at the bar like really
Looking like he wanna good time like really
Said he had got a friend for my home girl Lily, Lily, Lily, Lily

And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too

If you get money
Then you know just what I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 1]
I got a bad bitch
Her name, you don't need to know
If you can take her off of me
That mean I don't need the ho
Yeah, I'm like the number three
Something you ain't seen be-fo'
So we get it smackin'
Once we get back to my vehicle
I got so much drink to pour
And I got my reefer rolled
Girl, I'd love to stay
But gotta pack my things so we can go
They call me sayin' they need to know
How erryday I'm workin'
But my life just like the weekend though
And when we in the club
The owners gon' acknowledge us
Me, I'm drunk as hell
Throwing champagne bottles up
Yeah, we superstars
So the camera crews follow us
And all my diamonds traffic jam
They give you some kinda rush
Baby I'm a star
You can join this constellation
Shit wherever I want
Can't deal with constipation
Any chick that I handle
I teach 'em patience
How not to win the award
But be glad for your nominations
If getting money's the case, then I'm guilty
Need a shower, filthy
Wipe me down
I'm famous
All the bad hoes like me now
They don't just wanna fuck
They wanna become wifey now
You trying to make a name
But me, I got my own cloud
And I can't share no air space
See, I'm so Taylor Gang

[Hook]
I ain't gon' deny it
I be on some fly shit
See it, and I want it
Like it, then I buy it
You paying for it
I can make it priceless
I told you all this money ain't for show
I let it go
If you get money
Then you know just what I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 2]
Yeah
All this money got me feelin' bold
And niggas staring like they scared the speakers' getting old
You look decent but your girlfriend's a centerfold
I keep my mind closed for bitches whose tryin' dig for gold
Big cake, y'all dinner rolls
You just sink, boy, I been afloat
I been in this game and E gave me the sticks
Now I'm in control
And I'm playing on difficult
Hop another plane
New day, another ticket
So we smoke to the life
Write my name in the Swisher smoke
Niggas know
If they don't, then they bitch does
Rosé bottles spree, until they free my big Cuz
I tell her that she drunk
She say she just buzzed
Half a bottle later, she saying she in love
Some will say it's the fame
Some will say the drugs
Got you losing your brain
And doing these things in pub-lic
(Teheheh) Yeah
I'm on some own-world other shit
And you gon' have to find
Some decent shelter to get cover in
If she got no panties on, then let her in
And her set of friends
Meet the gang, whoa

[Hook]
I ain't gon' deny it
I be on some fly shit
See it, and I want it
Like it, then I buy it
You paying for it
I can make it priceless
Told you all this money ain't for show
I let it go
If you get money
Then you know just what I'm talking 'bout

[Intro: 2Pac Shakur & Rick Ross]
I'm already convicted
My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
Can't get, buy cars, can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, y'know, I'm still coming to court
Still smiling, still signing autographs, but soon I'ma go crazy!
You know what I'm sayin? And it's up to the world, y'know
America eats its babies, we, I'm
No matter what y'all think about me
I'm still your child, you know what I'm sayin?
You can't just turn me off like that
Huh! Huh! Huh!
M-M-M-M-Maybach Music

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ugh! 2Pac back, I’m two Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly, this the new Iraq (Philly!)
Soon as I hit the the hood, they screaming, "Who got whacked?"
It’s a recession on the work, I’m screaming, "Who got crack?"
I’m sipping Hennessy!
Riding on my muh'fuckin' enemies!
Sliding in the back, I'm screaming, "MMG!" (Maybach Music)
Ten bitches and they dime so it's ten I see, Hail Mary!
Put my wrist on froze, presidential is gold
Nigga play with my money, my shooters lifting his soul (Blow!)
That kick like it's soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch, I’m like John Wall 'cause I just give 'em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold 'em
Look at the motherfuckin' wheels! Them bitches is stolen
They screamin'

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming, "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
We catch the nigga that did it then we gon' carry his head
Fuck a 911, tell 'em have him a bed
I'm talking Death Row Records, tell 'em have me a chair
And let it burn, I'm screaming, "Free my nigga Hearn"
He drew with no hesitation, we can’t even get a turn
Copped my Makaveli CD and I listened and I learned
Grabbed my MAC above the dresser, my OG said, "Hold it firm"
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac (Pac!) and cyphers with B.I.G (B.I.G!)
Tried to send me upstate with the lifers and bid
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like it's a price on my head
I'm going max! Got me knocking suckers on they back
In these cells raising hell tryna get back to the trap
But don't ever get it twisted, it's Meek Mill, we spittin' facts (Meek Milly!)
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it
So they steady screamin'

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

(1st Verse)
Walk you home to see, where your livin' around, and I know this place
Pour yourself on me, And you know I'm the one, that you won't forget

(2nd Verse)
And in your denim eyes, I see something's awry, and I see you're weak
When he comes around, see your fixin' to shine, and my face won't speak

(Chorus)
Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said, 'you call that a pick up truck?'
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
Kickin' screamin' & rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know ohhhhh

(3rd Verse)
Tremblin' misery, and as cold as a hole
I hug your bones and skin, cracklin' woods gone white, and my eyes swoll up now
I can see the light
(Chorus)
Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said, 'you call that a pick up truck?'
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
Kickin' screamin' & rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know ohhhhh

Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said, 'you call that a pick up truck?'
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
Kickin' screamin' & rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
I think I'll fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness, it never ceases
Oh, I'm still in love with you
My headache keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?

[Chorus]
Still in love with you

[Verse 2]
They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
Darling, it's this empty feeling
That my heart can't disguise
After all that we've been through
I try all my best, but it's no use
I guess I just keep loving
Is this the end?

[Chorus]
Still in love with you

[Verse 3]
Now it's all over boy
There's something I think you should know
Baby, let me think it over
Just one more time before you go
Call on me, baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Please call me baby
Help me see if through

[Chorus]
Still in love with you
Still in love with you
Still in love with you
Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets
She wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you ain’t letting go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in

Oh
First class help you in the game like a free throw
Fill my bank up with cash, my glass with Clicquot
You ain't gotta tell your friends what we talk about
All the places that we go, we go
You're mine for the night, your man try and repo, oh
Work nights never sleep so you think she got no job
Go to school during the week on the weekend we go hard
Live so large, let you go tear down the mall like it’s your card
It's no problem, go ahead and sing it girl, this is your song

Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets
She wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and I go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in
Oh, nothin you can tell us, they get jealous when we show up show up
Make you feel like a little girl again, but fuck you like a grown up
High as you can be it's like the dream you never woke from
My life's like a movie, get ready for your close up
Pour bottles and toast up
Your man in your phone trying to see what your plans is
So what, you still turn up my songs soon as they playing it
Know what the sound is my new talks and you ain't saying shit
I'm a call you soon as I land
Probably roll some weed ride up on the beach while you tan
Party every week and you hardly would speak
But now you got my phone taking pictures
Laughing, smoking, chilling, yeah

Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and I go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in

We don't need nobody talk
Probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off
And I tell her hold on
Cause she say she never been this high
We don't need no nobody talk
Probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off
And I tell her hold on
Cause she say she never been this high

[Intro]
Woah, woah, ehh

[Verse 1]
I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

[Pre-Hook]
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain

[Verse 2]
Let me see you dance

Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the Devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

[Pre-Hook]
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame

Ohh
Flyer than ever, rep Taylor Gang where thee higher the better
My lines are clever,and all my bitches dimes or better
I'm 'bout my cheese mozzarella, chains like the old roc-a-fella
I know your girls a freak, but you'll never beat acapella
I got it locked the hell up, sewn
And they need no help I did it on my own
Oughta be pilot all the places that i've flown
If they made anotha me it'd be a million dolla clone
Haters gonna hate, the bitches say I'm on
My moneys like my hair, now its gettin' kinda long uhh
Comin' up people sworn they seen us

So roll up please in flex we trust
Let them lames be lame, we gon' just be us
So roll up please in flex we trust
Let them lames be lame, we gon' just be us

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
Cause the smoke is already in the air
I'm rolled up with two braids in my hair
I'll start with the kaki sweet
I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the VIP
Back when my only red was me E-Y-E
You so PYT and you're looking so fine
I'm sorry baby girl but tonight

[Chorus]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Get back to the episode, sacks of the chronic
Out of this world, could relax on a comet
This is church music, listen to the choir
To burn my kush, you must use fire
D-O double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC4
West coast worldwide sea shore to sea shore
When is the last time you've seen a G in a G4?
Don't worry I'll wait
Time is ticking I'm tripping
I'm slipping away
Into the zone where these hoes with they dogg on
A dogg whistle and they download my ring zone
And she is hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine go get your own
I put this to rhymes, get piece of mind
Oz's to die for, this weed is mine

[Chorus]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I hear niggas talking about what they rolling up
Smell what I smoke before the bag open up
Good chance if you see me that I'm smoking one
License to get it and roll this shit
Real nigga, buying weed, I dunn sold enough
If I'm in the building it's hard not to notice it
Hit em with ? I got some hoes to fuck
I'mma hit em with an ounce of the potent shit
Don't trip bitch, we gon all sip & blow the whole zip
Let you hit mine, plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigga get high and let the hoes twist!
Say you don't fuck, impressed how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like ours
I'm rolling, I'm smoking, they burning for hours
And if it's fire, I'm smoking the whole thing, getting tired

[Chorus]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mine

[Outro]
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?
Do you?
Do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me?

[Scratched Hook]
"Rappers are in danger"

[Verse 1]
Blast-Master Kris I don't talk ish
Expand your consciousness and dismiss foolishness
No one is new to this or new to Kris
In hip-hop's atomic structure, I am the nucleus
That is the center of the group we/us
They/them/you, every squad, every massive, every crew
Dental floss is lost when a true rapper jumps off
The cash is incidental but not meant to distract you, of course
The style that I am kicking is like chicken
It will be bitten, rewritten, then performed for a $25 admission
Reviewed in The Source
You will listen then find something missing of course... it's skills
That's what you're fishing for, it's lost
I'm getting too explicit, the track jingles
I won't do a wack album then remix it for my single
Kicking rhymes 'til I wrinkle, and my brown eyes twinkle
God-core hip-hop for the nine-cinco

[Scratched Hook]
"Rappers are in danger"

[Verse 2]
Tasty like a souflee french croissant on Tuesday
Rappers be boo-tay
Goo-fy that's how they crew stay
Bitin' whatever you say to boost they ego
We know the steelo, your whole character is foul
Makes me want to shoot a free throw, BLAOWW!
From the git go, no, get go, my flow hits low
Wherever all the dope shit go, there's where my shit go
Bee-dee-bee-bo, skank, I think
Self with ya groups everyone else and the bank
Others like to bring the shottie to the party
I bring knowledge of self, you cure the mind, you cure the body
Some rappers like to come to the party, hopin' to leave with somebody
Check, I come with skills and I leave with your motherfuckin' respect
Ahh yeah... so check, UH!

[Scratched Hook]
"Rappers are in danger"

[Verse 3]
New types of verbal hip-hop I bring
When you know you can sing, BOY, you know you can sing
I do not clutter up the airwaves, with stacks of useless facts
MC's trying to be macks, but acts like ignorant blacks
Freak that, I'll snap your back as it cracks
You will experience, loss or lack of balance
Stop the violence, fry from week to week like an allowance
All of you are cowards hiding behind the mask of MC
I remember, thinkin back to '83
No video, no, you had to be a real live MC
Now you younguns grow up buggin, any new jock you're huggin
Weak production, let me tell you somethin
Any MC can battle for glory
But to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story
Act like you never saw me
'Cause when it comes to lyrics, I'm in a different category

[Scratched Hook]
"Rappers are in danger"
I got sixteen sixteens and if I write one more song
And I'll be at seventeen again like Zac Efron
You punk motherfuckers get stepped on
I'm best on any beat that I take a mess on
I see right through you like you got mesh on
A hard body, like Brianna's dad I get my flex on
The best one, my name gets spoken 'bout
Cause I spit crack verses that bring smokers out
So know your route filled with unleaded
As I escort this beef to death like the paramedics
Yeah I said it, everything thing I touch is deaded
Tyler directed the funeral and this just got beheaded
Forget it, the killer's in the booth
And I'm drunk off this serum so all I spit is truth
And I don't really rap I am panic on this muse
How you get killed using verbally abuse
It's dead, somebody call the coroner
This is what it sounds like when Domo Genis cornered you
You're gone, knife to the neck
Just for respect, bitch this is OF
Yes I'm crazy, I'm a bastard
All I spit is dirty like pornographic rappers
Stop, you're dead honey
Cause I eat you all up like I was Ted Bundy
No funny, where the fuck you bunching?
I'm a serial killer, don't get your Cap n' Crunched, bitch

[Intro]
Let's do this
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, yo, wassup?
Word to my n-words

[Verse 1]
Don't got bros, don't hang in the streets
I don't beat my hoes, I only beat my meat, yeah
Don't womanize, 'cause you know it's true
That when you look in their eyes, you see they're people too
Mother effin' suffrage
I said, mother effin' suffrage

[Verse 2]
You know I'm a gangster, you know I do Coke
But I had to go to Diet, 'cause it burnt my throat
I've been doin' drive-bys all of my life
Except the bullets are newspapers, the car is my bike
Yeah
I said, the car is my bike

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo
3.14 apple pi
I say, I whip it out, I clean it off, I stick it in her eye
And by "it" I mean contact lens
It must have got dirty

[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo
3.14 apple pi
I got rhymes and flows that make Hitler cry
George Bush won't, he'll just yell and rant
But he's a presi-don't who Ameri-can't
Oh my Lord
The kid is, uh, he is clever
Come on, give it to him

[Verse 5]
I spit gangster hymns, 'cause I'm a gangster straight
I think of 20-inch rims when I masturbate
We're gonna be late, there's no time to waste
'Cause the girls that I date, have a particular taste
The taste of my wiener
The taste of my wiener

[Verse 6]
Yo
3.14 apple pi
Why was I born White? No one quite knows why
Gangsters sell their rocks, I got a collection
You couldn't get a rise out of a yeast infection
Oh, what does that mean?
Yeast rises

[Verse 7]
Yo
I'm a lyrical heretic, but I'll make you laugh
I'll hit you with rhetoric, then I cut you in half
I don't need to be a clown, I don't need to be nice
How 'bout you sit down, and I serve you a slice
Of my 3.14 apple pi
My voice is so smokey, it'll make you high

[Verse 8]
Yo
Here's a confession, it's all about me
Here's my impression of a broken jet ski
Pu-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
Da-da-da, fill me with gas
I’m a jet ski

[Verse 9]
Here come the puns, here come the puns
Here come the puns, here come the puns
All you little thugs wanna mess with me?
Know that I been doin' drugs since the age of three
I took my cereal, stabbed it open with a knife
Snorted that shit and I got high on Life

[Verse 10]
Yo
A guy asked me for change, sayin' my mind was too dense
I said, "You won't make cents if you don't make sense"
Ah, look at that
Big finale... let’s hit it

[Verse 11]
You know I flow and show it, you know that Bo know it

[?] your lawn I'll grow it and mow it, 'cause he's a show poet
Yo, my rims be spinnin', I winnin', like Adam, I be sinnin'
Potato skinnin' and knittin' and separate those linens
In my eyes you see flies, and though you people try
Just to disguise all your lies, but, baby, I be wise
Know I did it and shit it, your brothers couldn't hit it
Then you try to rid it, too late! I already spit it
Ptooey
I already spit it

[Outro]
I said, apple pi

[Intro]
Uhh
Ayo, it's just another bombtrack, uh
Ayo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

[Verse 2]
It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Hey, yo, it's just another bombtrack, yeah
Check it out

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn
Burn

[Intro]
Hit 'em
Plain Pat, what up?
I ain't playing no more
Hey

[Verse 1]
This is my story, this is my song
If you feel it, motherfucker, you can't go wrong
To the screw-face niggas, what you on?
Get off that, get a goal and focus dog
See, I'm what you need, you fiending now
Ask around and I bet you'll figure out
How to zone and control your future, wow
Yeah, I think I'm in the future too
I'm unlike fools who proceed to choose
To be like them, I be like who
I be like me, Mister K-I-D
S-O-L-O, D-O-L-O
See, the Lord adore me
He met me half way
"No guts, no glory"
I always say
So until I reach what I came here to find
Along with inner peace, life will always be a grind
One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be super-duper Scott
The one bad bitches called super-duper lame
Now super-duper fame gets me super-duper brains
86 the cape, but I'm super-duper high
Soaring past the moon, a super-duper lonely guy

[Chorus]
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in

[Verse 2]
For even in Hell I still have faith
To one day be free with my Father at the Gates
But make no mistakes, I'll show you what time takes
To be a success on Earth, mixed with all the hate
I stand on my pivot, my life, you could not live it
For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits
I provide my grind, mixed with no edits
They say they don't want me when I'm fucked up and forgotten
Until I rise up amongst the evils trying to stop 'em
Slow down, bitch, my money is what I'm clocking
I'm tick-tocking, once I start, I ain't stopping
Such bullshit that my soul deal with
When my room's dim lit, I pray to God to help with, uh
My endeavors, in any kind of weather
Hoes be pleather-fake, so I erase 'em out my sim
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide trying to read my mind
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide trying to read my mind

[Chorus]
Down and out
Hey, down and out
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Hey, down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Hey, down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in

[Outro]
Down and out
Down and out
Down and out
Down and out
OK, OK this how we gonna do it
Plain Plat presents: 'A Kid Named Cudi'
Hello
All the time, nigga
All the grind, nigga

[Verse 1]
As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh, Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans, they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love, huh
Hold your horses
I'ma show you who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimpin' ain't easy, but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1, hun?

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')

[Verse 2]
I'll put Chanté Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly-ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symoné call date rape
Only 'cause I'm paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhané, she likes it when they say
"Everybody move your body"
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Back shots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fuckin' En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
(What about Toni Braxton?)
If that bitch give me action, guaranteed satisfaction

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin', Tim, man?
I ain't tryna diss the honeys
You know what I'm sayin'? (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
I just be buggin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't tryna disrespect nobody, you know?
I'm just buggin' out, you know? (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
You know the flavor of the Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique
Know what I'm sayin'?
Buttnaked Tim Dawg in the motherfuckin' house
I'm just playin' (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
We're just havin' a little fun
Ain't no harm done, B (I'm just playin', I'm sayin')
But I would hit all of y'all

[Chorus 1: André 3000]
I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

[Verse 1: André 3000]
I, I can't read minds, but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour
Your, your, yourself all over me
What you think? I could be wrong, but pupils don't lie
And if they do, by God, they must fry (Fry?)
You know, like electric chair
The way you stare, yeah, I'm there
You committed a crime and I'm the victim

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I've got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settlin' down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So, now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul? Honest me, gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chisholm
Was the first, let's rehearse makin' a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds until there's no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them
A postcard from 3000, hard

[Chorus 2: André 3000]
Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1: André 3000]
I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

[Chorus 2: André 3000]
Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

[Outro: André 3000]
The morning after...

[Intro]
A-C-E, O-F, uh

[Verse 1]
Wild, I'm not tame just because my visions are strange
I am normal not deranged, I am not a fucking lame
Your pee dripping wet, I need all my nutrients
On the phone, if I take you home how much can I get?
Yeah, I like you but, you act like you don't like us
We could start a whole new religion girl, in Odd we trust
You play hard to got, got me hard like cement
Here's my car I love please do not dip, please just

[Hook]
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait

[Verse 2]
I'm a fucking monster, my Tonka is trucker
In my locker got books, I'm a nasty mothafucker
Truth or dare in the cemetery, right past the elementary
My faith lasts for the whole century
You could bite my neck or I could bite your neck
Or you could bite her and excite her you will not regret
My castle got dungeons, my dungeons got dungeons
Open up them legs, let me see what's for luncheon

[Hook]
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(Can you just) go
(But please don't) wait

[Bridge]
And the sky is dark
The bats invade the park
The water swims the shark
But don't just wait, go

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Wishes that the world could see
From the position of my girl and me
From the perspective of laying on the hood of a car
Looking up at the stars with all the connections cut
Cause when you stuck, advantages vanishes
Bandages on the damages of what depression does
Sequestered cause, who are they to question us?
Beating up our ear drums like Question Love
With all of their requests from above
Press from below, only directions to bus
Thus we laying in the cut on the Cutlass Supreme
Looking up at the scene
Hoping it doesn’t cut, the fresh and the make up
Get re-fed the lines and reminded of what they mean
The importance of really acting like they important
And if you don’t feel ‘em you should force ‘em
Now...

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Wishes that mend the broken heart
Fill the open palm, pardon my flow and thoughts
My departure from the norm, to parts that's more warm
War torn from the marchin' of your armies and the droppin' of your bombs
The walking on the waters now stomping on the pond
The ripples now a wave
It can’t be peaceful with a pistol in your face
You can’t beat the people so you picking on they place
I jump to defend, I wage with a page
My pen’s mightier than them and I got missiles on the stage
This couch is for the cowards and stretchers for the brave
And I happily lay upon the bed that I have made
Like house keep, sheets and pillow case
But I don’t sleep, dreams is keeping me awake
They went up thinking they would never touch the ground
But we gon wish it ‘pon ‘em on the way back down

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro]
We are
Lasers
We shed light on injustice and inequality
Lasers stand for peace
Lasers stand for progression
Lasers are the future
We’re not losers
We are

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Y'all niggas really thought we wasn't gonna do it again?
Come on man, grand Hustle nigga, you know what it is
T.I.P, DJ the fuck Drama, Young Dro, Young Buck
I said P-$-C-what's-happenin'-nigga

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Yo Khao!
I'm a pimp type, nigga ridin' clean after midnight
Ready for the gun play, prepared for a fist fight
Roll up on yo bitch and ask her what that pussy hit like
First she acting funny, in a minute she gon' get right
Get down, got her fuckin' with another bitch now
I'm king of all that I survey, remember this is T.I.P. town
Hey, you ain't ready? pussy nigga better sit it down
We Mac-90, rock steady nigga spit rounds
Turn yo stomach to spaghetti when it hit the ground
Toss the choppers in the Chevy, then we mashing down Campbellton counting all your Benjamins and Hamiltons
As far I'm concerned you just a job for the janitors
Don't disregard I'm a God you a amateur
Hide behind ya bodyguards and ya manager
I pimp hard throughout all the pages in the calendar
Bitch it's Pimp Squad: all action no cameras

[Hook x 2: ALL]
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
You know what it is, you know what it do
And you know what it is, and you know what it do
Shorty we bury niggas, shorty we bury niggas
Shorty we bury niggas, shorty we bury niggas
The undertaker

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Hey, stand in on the trap with me
Mention me is blasphemy, 1000 round magazine
My partnas say no attackin' me
I'm aged to the average beef, respiratory crushin beats
Fruit Chevy H.I.C, my lyrics hit like HIV
Spray by me, Sniper Dro, murder come today by me
Bullet chip yo L I P and dirty all yo H I Ps
Shot both of yo homies, now they feedin' them through a I.V
The tray I be from the west side, where they say I be
May I be the ruler over all that I survey I be
Laid back, yay's black, triple kiwi Maybach
Weed match the Benz, kush triple kiwi 80 pack
Old school baby crack. I'm tryin' to bring the 80's back
Haitians get me Haiti crack, plus my momma hated crack
'Til we got a evicted and I came through with them 80 stacks
Play it back, rewind where I live
I'm a zone 3 hustla, niggas know what it is

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
May we all bow our heads and pray for this nigga
The undertaker's comin' any day for this nigga
They hate him in the hood, for the dreams he been sellin'
I read the paperwork and it seems you was tellin'
You know what it is and you know who I'm talkin' bout
When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth
What you scared fo'? niggas know you been a ho
It's like....homey shit was all good just a week ago
Get the goons ready, start up your vehicle
And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before
Pick up the shells if ya use a automatic
They gave 50 years to my nigga Lil' Travis
Set a booby-trap, let him trip over the wires
Then he gon' be laying....right by the preacher and the choir
And if u catch him 'fore I do, T.I. go and handle yo biz
When you see me holla at me homie, you know what it is

[Hook x 2]

[Refrain]
I had a dream that the whole world was starin' at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there
Wasn't no one there, yeah
Same song to a different beat
Cause really sometimes I feel like I'm the only one here
I guess nobody cares
But everything's good 'til it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being tired
And dealin' with your BS
All the while supplyin'
The money for your request
Without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty
I can get another one quickly
But I'd rather wait it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
Ha

[Refrain]
I had a dream that the whole world was starin' at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there
Wasn't no one there, yeah
Same song to a different beat
Cause really sometimes I feel like I'm the only one here
I guess nobody cares
But everything's good 'til it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Verse 2]
Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now you're off the set
And I'mma let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow, think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes
The story of my life, you're just another page

[Refrain II]
But everything's good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Outro]
I had a dream that the whole World was starin' at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there
Yeah eh eaah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, it's hardly a secret
You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend (weekend)
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Losses a nigga took, had to charge it to the game
Always wanted stardom and the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are

[Verse 2:]
Never gets boring
And haters in your face, you just ignore em
Don't know what they talking shit for
See niggas get theirs, you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborne
Seen the bullshit comin' and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
And thoughts start getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
Feel your scars knowin what your pain is
But what's it all worth if it's painless?
Say you wanna be famous

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just starting, I've been doing it
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my light
But chances I don't get em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase em
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came from

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Chorus]
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know

[Verse 1]
To shape you and hold you I admit that was my mission
But everything went wrong there cause you started acting different
The day you ran up on me I was smoking chilling
Swear you was trying to roll ain't know what was soo apealing
Fast forward I'm on the road your at home calling me back forth
Can't deal with this relationship but it's what you asked for
As for them picture of them bitches
Shit I probably wouldn't be with them if your ass wasn't tripping
Not to mention you actin like a kid is the fucked shit I gotta deal with
Send a text, leave me a message, try not to listen
Bring a ref you was the main player I had to bench you
When I showed your ass how to ball, that Louis I bought it all

[Chorus]
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know

[Verse 2]
Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend
You be blowing my phone up trying to see who I'm seeing
But I'm chasing this paper so for this paper I'm reaching
Might fuck one or two bitches but dont consider it cheating
I consider the fact that we'll break up anyway (anyway)
Based on all the shit that you dont appreciate
Me switching states, working hard meeting dates
And you were thinking everything was sweet, piece of cake
Well that all changed
What we had was big, but you going to miss the small things
And that little cash I spent, that was small change
But above all things
I still love you
Just gotta do my own thing

[Chorus]
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know

[Outro]
Now I go
I'll never come back
And when you call
I'll never call back
Cause I got a new girl
Yeah, I got a new girl
Everything was all good
Then went all bad
No, I don't think 'bout the things that we had
Cuz I got a new girl
Yeah, I got a new girl

[Intro]
Yeah
Hey
Yeah, hey
Fayettenam, yeah
Bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind, tryna figure where this 20 G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Counting days, still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off 'cause her titties too small
I could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door with a towel on and nothin' under that
Saying welcome
Hey, yeah
Yeah, welcome
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I let these words flow out like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd
'Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hit the souls of all those that I've reached
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana, wonder will this high ever end?
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome
I tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own

[Outro]
Yeah, I deal with it on my own, nigga
Yeah, oh, welcome

[Intro]
Beijing to Saigon, Beijing to Saigon

And all my measures is drastic like rocking leather in Afri- ca
Ha, I’m laughing at you dumbass niggas
Bitch, hiking ass gotta give you thumb ass niggas

Give me Jordans and J’s, just a young ass nigga
I wear Levis that be hot as the streets out in Hialeah
I’m watching Eli in the hummer, I’m screaming “Andele E.I”
It’s funny I got your honey, told her welcome to the beehive
I can see why, I can be why the reason you niggas hate
I’m a grinder, that’s just a reminder
You can look around for your girl, you won’t find her
Telling me to chill, I don’t really have the time to
Ohhh where your girl from? Uh, Japan or China
And I’m Just

Konichiwa Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches

And you niggas won’t bang-a-thing
I’m wally, wipe your gang-and-them
So if you haters hate me you can lollipop my gang-i-lang
I’m banging like the motherflucking bass up on the treble
I swear I eat these beats and I can taste the instrumental
Your girl says I’m running through the mazes of her mental
She give me brain she don’t wanna keep the taste up in her dental
Man I know chicks, I got more chicks
I got fast chicks, I got slow chicks
I know flexible chicks that can do gymnastics and aerobics
I know that chick, I know your chick
And I do my singing for chicks
I know more tricks than a magician who know tricks
She say ‘oh shit’, cuz I better get her wetter than the ocean
If you say no to Lanez then pussy nigga you don’t know shit
I’m so dope that you can smoke this out in alleyways and porches
I be balling like I’m bowling, but hit strike like it’s a protest in the poaches
Swavey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uh, last verse but the nigga back first
With a billi and a milli and I’m really back for firmly rappers, or silly actors
And I’m going for a bong and I’m on a ladder
And I got a couple women that be living in my city and they can’t talk with me unless they really looking pretty
And the niggas call their phone cuz they really is pity cuz they really give me dome in a tele in a tele
And I’m getting in their belly, really getting ready
Hot like a chilli pepper sitting in the middle of a dessert
I’ma give ya’ll what ya bitches de-nali?
And I be getting blown out when I’m sipping Cavalli
I keep it dirty like bad black chick in an alley
But I be clean like a wiped white chick in a valley
I got a girl in Miami, a chick up in Cali
I do bitch hoes I should be rowdy
Wait, Hold the phone, I’m on the phone
The young soldier, the boy known to hold his own
I make an Atlanta bitch give me Georgia dome
And if I ever am rich I am more than known
The type of balling you gotta put Jordan on
And no, this alcohol got me more than gone
And if you ain't heard I’m balling then your source is wrong
And I’ve been looking for a grill like a scorching own
Escort your own to the Porsche owned
And I run this shit like a course baton
My bag is Louis and of course Vuitton
In the air nigga and I ain't got my Forces on
I eat rappers and get a full coursing on
Lame, yall niggas get a full torching on
And if you ain't doing right then of course it’s wrong
But I'ma kill them Dr. Kevorkian
Konichiwa Bitches
Swavey

[Verse]
Juicebox, tank top, tube socks
Dude stop, forehead shiny like a new Glock
Two shots fired at the Excursion we were swervin' in
All-purpose verses with a passion for servin' kids
Empty out your purses on an immature crime spree
Eyin' up the nurses with some gloves that read "I squeeze"
Who the fuck said to speak, Mr. Me-Is-Siamese?
Even Christ said "Christ, he flows quite nicely"
Hypebeast's highly likely to bite me
And try to high five me, but I just give them high threes
'Cause y'all don't get two, touch me, I'm the shit
Sue me, if you got an issue, grab a tissue
Mediocrity is odd to me
Ass as far as ya eyes can see. Who the best? They holla me
Nombre, Ho-lay shit, I don't spit crack, I spit cocaine crisp
I ain't fuckin' with it if it's no payment
'Cause everyone knows paid dues don't pay rent
I'm dope like the coke that I'm laced with
Dreams what I'm chasin', flow hot it's chafin'
This is why I'm hot? No, that is why I'm blazin'
Dilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like the diamond that I'm draped in
But I don't wear jewelery, it's HUF over Louis V
Excuse the endurance miss, this critic thing is new to me

[Intro: Sade]
Ain't gon' let you go...

[Verse 1: Sade]
I was the one
I who could, pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet, and I gave you my love
You are the one who got me started
You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

[Chorus: Sade]
You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go...
(Ain't gon' let you go...)

[Verse 2: Sade]
You laid me down
Left me for the lions
A long long time ago
You left me there dying
(Ain't gon' let you go...)
But you never let me go

[Chorus: Sade]
You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go...
(Ain't gon' let you go...)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I know we could have had it all
I wasn't ready to go steady, no not at all
Smoke and mirrors clouded my vision we hit a wall
Couldn't see the moon and the sky behind the fog
Pregnant, pause
Damn your baby tall, what you been up to?
I don't blame you my doll
Yeah, we kinda stalled
As God as my witness, timin' was my mistress
I guess it's in the stars for me to love you from a distance
Ah, our ship sailed, ah, the wind blows
The door's always open but our window is closed
You always thought "What if?"
But that'll just drive you crazy baby, girl interrupted
Thinkin' 'bout what wasn't
Thinkin' 'bout what was it?
Was it somethin' I done?
Somethin' I could do better although nothin' could be done
Sometimes you get what you need
Not what you think you want
So baby no moon and sky, get a beautiful sun, uh

[Verse 4: Sade]
You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard, will stay on your mind
It ain't gon' let you go, no
'Cause you are the moon and I the endless sky

[Chorus: Sade]
You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know

[Outro: Sade]
We had the moon and the sky above
And I gave you my love
(Ain't gon' let you go...)

[Chorus]
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gu-u-u-cci
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gucci, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh (Go!)

[Verse 1]
Hurdle my opponents, run through problems
Unstoppable, I jump over obstacles
Stop my grind like stop sunshine, so improbable
Probable mission impossible
I said it two times nigga, nigga stop lying
Bullshit you selling now I'm just not buying
Flow so nice but the kid's not kind
Swear its sicker than a new flu they got called swine
Standing on point like a unicorn
Strapped with a uni-bomb
Everday's a workday but don't wear uniform
Gucci Mane a dapper don
Trouble like a Capricorn
Trapper month going on a money makin marathon
You the Joker I be Robin
And the Riddle is the Batman's throne
Try not to fuck my money up and rap career like Pacman Jones
Thumb print me, finger print me
But can we agree to disagree
Im from east Atlanta 6 where the boys dump bricks
But we don't bump the Blueprint 3
Wanna box me just like Max B
But you can't fuck me like Raz-B
Like Ali I'mma float like a butterfly sting like a bee cuz its big Gucci, Gucci

[Chorus]
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gu-u-u-cci
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gucci, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh

[Verse 2]
Streets de-railed me
But God didn't fail me
Opportunity knocked but it just emailed me
D.A nailed me, watch them jail me
Take it like a champ while the whole world mail me
Young don't like me, Jay out-sells me
Nothing in the world Kanye couldn't tell me
You can beat anyone but Gucci
Job so hard, I can hardly do it
'Cause whatever that I heard use to let that
Bet if you had the chance to you'd mute me
Convicted felon, my left wrist yelling
My stash here you go and my bones done swellin
Crazy so I need prozac really
My home kept skep and my folks so eerie
So hardworkin that my bones still reary
Fall in the club then the hoes start cheerin'
So hear me, hear me, I know y'all hear me
I don't like life to much not really
High like Britney, stoned like Jimmy
Got a second chance like Vick in Philly
This ain't snap music, this is trap music
New boys in Cali, yeah, they got a jerk movement
Bricksquad niggas we rep the block
Gucci mane I work forks and pots

[Chorus]
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gu-u-u-cci
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gucci, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gu-u-u-cci
Ahhhhh Gucci, Gucci, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign, ahh, ahh

[Hook: Patty Cash]
Diamond Life, Sugar baby we dynamite
Playboy and socialites, young and fly, fly, fly

[Verse 1: Tyga]
1989 no pressure
But to be the bestest in my section, levels of a professional
Skip school, create my own lessons
Confessions of a mad rapper, music got me rapping
Green stretching, only leads to red stretches
He's next in line, for the blessing
Get your mind off minds, hustle something and stop relying on mine
More then a legend why you letting time fly by
At age 17 addicted to ink
A rap fiend, who had money dreams
My chase of fame couldn't compare to what I seen
Them die, government lying, hard for the paper cheese
Moms crying watching her only son, through TV
MTV, BET
He on now wipe me down
No longer fighting through the crowd
I control the crowd oh you like me now wow!
Chorus Patty Cash
Diamond Life
Sugar baby diamond life
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly
Diamond Life
Sugar baby diamond life
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly
Verse 2
Back to the cool motivational roads
No guidance just violence in probational homes
Thinking my high routes is all out
Music gotta be my way out
Family gathered around I gotta make em proud
Pops popped in the penatenary laided out
Hoping his son fell under a different cloud
I'm speaking directly into the crowd
Nothing personal
Just thought you would love to know the person
Far from perfect
But nearly word perfect
Must be he weighed him
On a scale form 1 to me, me
Even the greatness
Money equal a every 10 haters
The rest couldn't make it though the unlikely behavior
So be patient
Or end up the next patient
Emergency room, newspaper
The new rappers call em street actors
Music wise they playing safety
And I'm shooting on safety aiming for greatness
Chorus Patty Cash
Diamond Life
She gon ? tyga right
Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly
Diamond Life

Playboy and socialites
Young and Fly Fly Fly Fly

Now every body where you game face
Forget it everybody just do what he say
They wanna move like they wanna be like
You can do it just like like, like
Diamond Life
Now every body where you game face
Forget it everybody just do what he say
They wanna move like they wanna be like
You can do it just like like, like

Chorus Patty Cash

Get the message (got diamonds)
I'm getting cream like a nestle

[Shortened Hook: Big Sean]

[Verse 1: GLC]

Black T, fitted jacket
CD's stackin'
See what's crackin'
Just imagine he ain't packin'
Now it's a joke like he ain't mackin'
If your girl ain't trying to go
Better leave; don't lead to scrappin' (Aite)
GLC remarkably;
Exercise is pimpin tactics
She gave me easy access
But she needs some assets
Her friends informative; I call them "Readers Digest"
All up on the internet
They documenting my progress (What?)
Everything I do and say
Immaculatin' I guess
Having goals, getting close
What's too close for comfort...
It's difficult up in the 'Go
When you got no sponsor...
Trying to get my bankroll...
Beasts have heard me; Monster
Paper stacking up to the ceiling
What a feeling, it's so appealing

[Full Hook]
Now we gon' get it like we should...
Okay 

[6x]
And we livin' real good...
Okay

[Verse 2: Big Sean]

Now they gonna say that nigga B.I. on top of his B.I.; Business
Got signed like petitions
Committed to commission
Im gonna get it till' my chick got every pair of high heals
All my cribs on high hills...
This is how I feel
On track on top of tracks
You can ask my nigga GL
Hop on tracks with me; fuck around and get derailed
I come from where that cash is more important than the people
If it's prices on your head, then you're gonna get retailed
Come through in the spot...
Bet they give me props
Like a broadway show
Now who them broads waiting for?
Man who the D applaud for?
To keep goin', they pourin', supportin'
And that's why I do it for them
B.I.G

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]

Hold up Sean, roll up some
And let me talk
I didn't crawl to get wet
I am dog, now let me walk, it out
All across every hood
All across the map
All across the global...
And I just need a thick model chick to come home to
Teach her how to work pro tools
Therapy for my vocals
Living good in South Beach
Smoking tree with the locals
Fuck you Mr. Middle Man
I'm so glad I cut you out
Now I'm about to show you what this stunting on them really about
Show you what my city's about
Even though I'm chilling up in the Chi
Cleveland on my left field, Mid West niggas never die (Never)
We just hop on planes and change the time...
So let me set my G Shock
Sean tell them my state of mind

[Hook]

[Intro: Angela McCluskey, Kendrick Lamar]
Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)
What's behind the other door, oh
No more silence, don't kill this thing we got called love
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Hook: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?

[Hook: Angela McCluskey, Kendrick Lamar]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling (Where is the love?), don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5
Clearport, say hello to the man
Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
And that's love

[Hook: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration
Get on yo knees nigga, get on yo knees and pray

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Increase the doses, bust on whoever closest
Thug livin', hell of prison, never losin' my focus
I'm makin' money moves mandatory, end of discussion
My past records tell a story, picture niggas with rushin'
And still bustin', 'til the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin' my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin' villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legitly
So I laugh til I'm cryin', when the Lord come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga missed me
Why plant seeds in a dirty bitch waitin' to trick me
Not the life for me, livin' carefree 'til I'm buried
And if they dare me, I'll bust on them niggas, and until they scurry
I'm clearly a man of military means, to my artillery
Watchin' over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin' dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past in vain
Never knowin' if this game will last, feelin' the shame
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin' my soul
Got tired of small time livin' nigga tellin' me no
I got mine, fuck them other suckas
That's the mentality, jealous ass bustas make it hell for a hustler

[Hook: 2Pac & Yaki Kadafi]
Lord, help me change my ways (Lord!)
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (help me change my ways)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler (why I was raised this way?)
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (on a judgement days)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler

[Verse 2: Edi Mean]
Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, bein' broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay strugglin' and jugglin' with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? "all" is for lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin' you soft niggas is outta here
In case you forgot we on the same shit that got us here

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Yo, to e'ry step I take, e'ry sell I make
E'ry jail I break, e'ry mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin' charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missin' dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dyin' luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin' cracks or raps, s
