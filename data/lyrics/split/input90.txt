ough
Age can bе a klepto, apologize for my retro
That tеxtbook F flow if let go can turn little hugs to X O
In one swipe of a Metro
That's a champagne train of thought
Talk a awfully Kara Walker off-the-wall author
With no competitors, I play both sides
I'm a Wall Street bet, Reddit editor
Plus the secretary of treasury, et cetera, et cetera
God bless the United States of America
Good night

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
(Yeah, yeah, go)
Woke up feelin' shiesty
I'm on a, uh (Go)
Yeah, okay
Who the hell is-
(Grrr, grrr, grrr, grrr)
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Woke up, feelin' shiesty, give me that pussy nicely (Go)
Hundred thousand on an ice piece, finna fuck a Pisces (Mm)
Fifty hoes wanna be wifey, that's just too unlikely
Pull up six deep just like the Isleys, pick your next move wisely (Go)
They say talk is cheap, but fuck that, my convo pricey (Yeah)
Two hundred racks inside a shoebox, bitch, these ain't no Nikes (Ooh)
She think I'm finna trick, I told her, "Don't get too excited"
Nigga touch one hair on top of my head, them boys incitin' riots
I fuck her from the back and grip her neck, this bitch can't keep quiet (Ah)
The big bad hood you said you from is lookin' mighty quiet (Shut up)
I only eat my main bitch pussy, I'm on a straight diet
My shooter lookin' like a center, homie 6'5"
Could kill me once, could even kill me twice, shit, I got six lives (Yeah)
I'm thinkin' of movin' to Africa, and marry six wives (Yeah)
I'm in New York, we still got several poles and seven big knives (Uh)
Might take his life for tellin' several lies, can't let shit fly (Fuck)
'Cause if we do, he'll tell the next guy, and then it's all bad (Uh)
Who said that you could come around this side without a hall pass? (Uh)
I used to tweak, pourin' fours and Wock' inside a wine glass
These niggas burnt, outchea' poppin' Xans for a bypass (Who the hell is-)
I see you niggas every single time like an eyelash (Uh)
Bitch said she like athletes, so I walked in with them thigh pads
I'm paranoid, I can't hang out for long, bitch, I'm a nomad (Uh)
Christmas came around, and I had bought my steppers doormats (Uh)
Inside the whip, the seats is bright orange like the Lorax (Fuck)
I'm built tough, was made to be outside just like Gore-Tex
I should make a song about Ferraris, I don't do 'Vettes (Fuck)
My brother need a new Tek, my mama want a new bag
These niggas flip-flop every week, they in a new set (Fuck)
I know these niggas hate me 'cause I run around like a nuisance
Too fly, over niggas heads like an air vent
Where I'm from, it's one way in and out just like a camp tent

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Put a convertible on the Glock, it look like Lamborghini (Yeah)
Put a convertible on the Glock, it look like Lamborghini
I just told lil' baby to bop before my girl see me (Who the hell is-)
Pull that lil' stack, get niggas whacked, you better not look for pinky
In and out the trap that's where I stay, but I ain't one sleepin'
I'm totin' an SK for no reason, all my opps are dead
I got rubies on my teeth and plus my Molly's red
I'ma drop his ass soon as I see him, it ain't no discussion
Told her it ain't nothin' to get her a bust down if that pussy bussin'
All of a sudden, bitches love me 'cause I'm gettin' money
I'ma punish any nigga decide to stand in front of me
I was spendin' bands before it was a trend from the ugly
Always got revenge, if I ain't get my man, I got his cousin
They know I made my woodwork, hop out with a Oak
Haters poppin' out the woodwork, but they wanna prope
Talkin' straight gas nigga, I want all the smoke
I just told Lil Yachty to scoot over, let me drive the boat
AR with the scope 'cause the Cartier's nearsighted
Just got a nigga yoked, you don't like it, we could hit 'bout it
We could hit 'bout it, yeah, we could hit 'bout it
Hittin' the missionary she start yellin', tell her, "Be quiet"
I'm with Lil Yachty, we got twin 'Raris
We don't fuck with niggas, you don't like it, we could hit 'bout it (Who the hell is-)
We could hit 'bout it, yeah, we could hit 'bout it
I ain't passin' my reefer, you don't like it, we could hit 'bout it
We could hit 'bout it, yeah, we could hit 'bout it
I ain't doin' no features, you don't like it, we could hit 'bout it (Hit 'bout it, hit 'bout it)
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I picked you up from the airport
Your smile didn't feel the same
Asked you a question, then watched as
You shot it down like a plane
And I'm not being too dramatic
I'm the one who bought your flight
I knew I shouldn't have told you
How much I make a week
And we both think that it's stupid
That they pay me just to sing
And I can sing for you for free
But it's just never quite as special
As the first time, I sang you
First Day of My Life
We both thought Bright Eyes was old news
But the song still made you smile
And I feel like it's been a while
Since your light shone on my account

[Chorus]
But when you're not around
I turn into something
I'm not lost or found
I'm neither, I'm nothing
When you're not around
There's not much to say
Hear me yelling out loud
My love went away, hear me shout

[Instrumental Outro]

Fingers are holding you right at the edge
You're slipping out of my hands (Yeah, yeah)
Keeping my secrets all up in my head
I'm scared that you won't want me back (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink 'til I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

I drink 'til I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you

[Verse 1]
On the streets where the streetcars are squeaking through the morning
The flags that are raised start to wave
Goodbye to the old people gathered by warnings
I stand on he corner and feel like a foreigner

[Chorus]
Oh, far from the sparkling blue waters
Where the fish and the canvasses play
And the waves are as calm as my father
And the daughters are dancing all day

[Verse 2]
In the house where the housewares are thrown out the window
And soap opera dreams, they do scream
And the people inside can't decide where they will go
For the track, it is wrong, and the train, it is long

[Chorus]
Oh, far from the sparkling blue waters
Where the fish and the canvasses play
And the waves are as calm as my father
And the daughters are dancing all day

[Verse 3]
All the diamonds are packed back behind in the redwoods
In the Japanese freighters back home
But I won't cut that tree 'til I'm sure that it's deadwood
And the last leaf is fallen and summer is gone

[Chorus]
Oh, far from the sparkling blue waters
Where the fish and the canvasses play
And the waves are as calm as my father
And the daughters are dancing all day
And the daughters are dancing all day
Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Young Thug]
Every night, I wake up
I hear sirens outside my window (I'm proud of you)
Ayy (Oh)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Waking up in the middle of the night
Bunch of babies cryin' and mad niggas fightin' and screamin'
Then I heard a couple more shots like, "Fah, fah"
Then I heard the cops (I'm proud of you)
They rushin' down the block to justify
Wish pity, hoping you black to push your top back
Firin' warning shots in your back
With no strings attached (Yeah)
Lookin' from the nosebleed
Watchin' everybody that's before me hold up my trophy
It's mine, mine, mine (Mine)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm proud of you (Yeah)
I swear to God I gotta bow for you (Yeah)
Keep it G with me, tell me if you love me, you lovе
You said you love me back, said you love mе back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Show me that you love me
Ain't talkin' sex, but baby, tell me that you fuck with me
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Fuck gettin' Botox, I wanna see natural (Woo), yeah (No cap)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I don't wanna see you when you're mad (Yeah)
Wouldn't wanna see you ever sad (Ayy)
Speedy Gonzales in a Jag' (Skrrt, chasin' my love, yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
I wanna tell you 'bout your daughter and them every single day

[?] titanium tub when you bathe (Boss)
You know enough and you know your plays (No cap, no cap)

[Refrain: Young Thug]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'm proud of you (Yeah)
I swear to God I gotta bow for you (Yeah)
Keep it G with me, tell me if you love me, you love
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Show me that you love me
Ain't talkin' sex, but baby, tell me that you fuck with me
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Fuck gettin' Botox, I wanna see natural (Woo), yeah

[Verse 3: T-Shyne]
Tell me that you love me, uh
Tell me that you love me
And you'll never ever put no one above me
I told you lies, but still you told me that you trust me
I need your love and, girl, I wanted you to hug me
No matter what they tell me, I'ma ride
I got the doors goin' up, they suicide
And, girl, I promise I owe you that 'til we die
I had to tell my homies 'bout this friend of mine
And shawty from the east coast
She takin' me back like I was repoed
And I will start to see knowledge
Tryna rebalance
She want some drugs, she on a ecstasy challenge
No matter what, I know that I will never ever fall
Before I couldn't see and then I made it out the fog
Mirror, mirror told me I'm the baddest of 'em all (You), yeah
I went and got some money, I got paid to be a boss
You can't tell me 'bout the struggle if you never took a loss
You can't tell me 'bout this money if you askin' what it cost
Feel like I'm above the law, free my niggas out the yard
Have you ever felt pain? Have you ever been ashamed?
Have you ever brought glory to your family last name?
(Have you? Have you? Have you?)
I told my bitch I'm glad to have her
I told her, "No one else matters"
Havin' water like bad bladder
Whip clean, I'ma Dirty Diana

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Show me that you love me
Ain't talkin' sex, but baby, tell me that you fuck with me
You said you love me back, said you love me back
I got your back, run up you a sack
Fuck gettin' Botox, I wanna see natural, yeah

[Verse 4: 6LACK]
Say she love and wanna slide in the stacks
Don't know everything, but I know we a match
Every time I see her, I get a minor heart attack

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a bеtter life than this
You need somethin' I can nеver give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: J. Cole & Usher]
Yeah, I used to curse her name
I felt bitter, felt betrayed, in some urgent pain
I ain't pointin' fingers, know that I deserve some blame
Ain't put my business on the street, ain't felt the worst of shame
But I learned some things
And most of all I grew (Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I wanna thank her now I got a brand new point of view
They say shit happens for a reason and I think it's true
'Cause if it wasn't for the trials that I went through
I crack a smile because I never would've met you

[Verse 2: Usher]
Shit, when I needed you, you went and showed your face
Brought with you somethin' you do, it can't replace
Thick in the bottom but you slimmer from the waist up
You ride with me for me, ain't worried 'bout the pay stub
I fall in love too quick that's why it never lasted
She gon' wet this bed up, fuck you mean?
Hit it from the back, shit
Fuck that old passion
Why don't we make a classic?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
When you feel it clickin', you do scrub in it
In addition to the physics, it's a vibe to this
Ooh, got me feelin' like I can do life with this
But I learned my lesson so this time no misstep
Lookin' for the piece that I was tryna fit
Toxics, all our key
But it brought my kids, thankin' God it did
Plus I'm here with you, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh woah)

[Chorus: Usher]
It was time well spent tryna get right here (Oh)
Oh, drama, trauma, karma (Oh, oh, oh)
I got problems with my baby momma (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
But it was time well spent tryna get right here
Sippin' on you, layin' with you
Kissin' on you, to tell you the truth I

[Verse 3: Usher]
Pull up in a fast whip, faded and I'm swervin'
Fist full of dollars, I feel like you deserve it
Cash on delirium, we throw that shit on purpose
Booty twerkin', got a nigga in his Birkin, yeah (Oh-oh)
You see the side I don't show no one else (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's been some time since I could be myself (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
But it's the same road that I barely got through (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
That led me to you

[Chorus: Usher]
It was time well spent tryna get right here (Oh)
Oh, drama, trauma, karma (Oh, oh, oh)
I got problems with my baby momma (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
But it was time well spent tryna get right here
Sippin' on you (Oh), layin' with you (Layin' with you)
Kissin' on you (Yeah), to tell you the truth I

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Damn this better feel better than it did last year
The water ain't dry so did my past tears
I met you at a time when my faith and my ability to love
Was depleted, so forgive if I wonder
Are we headed for a ring or are we headed for a judge?
It's just another fling or are you just another drug?
Are you just another crutch for a heart that's been broken
And been breakin' hearts too, I got a feeling 'bout you, yeah

[Bridge: Usher]
Drip-drop when I get in your slot
Jackpot, don't stop
Girl, that water keep 

[?] down
Down, oh, down, down
Can you flip-flop?
Oh I already went all in
Switchin' my clothes
Miss, I done really fell for you, oh, oh

[Outro: Usher]
The truth is I don't want no more
Drama, trauma, karma (Oh, oh, oh)
I got problems with my baby momma (Yeah)
It was time well spent tryna get right here (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Drama, trauma, karma (Oh, oh, oh)
It was time well spent tryna get right here
If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case
On nancy, with the laughing face

She takes the winter and makes it summer
And summer could take some lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's nancy with the laughing face

Have you ever heard mission bells ringing
Well she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singing
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy, with the laughing face

Earl on the Beat

Chorus: Lil Yachty
I ain't mad at 'em, Baby
If I seen you out, me too would be up on you crazy
Diamond in the rough
You look as good as Oprah's bank account
I just wanna take you out
Fuck you in your momma house
Overseas, I’ll fly you out
Is he tricking Do she really love me
Let's just find it out
Baby, what's up with your mouth
City girl, straight from the south

Verse 1: Drake
Back home I know presi, I’m Obama
I condone the drama
I tongue down Madonna
Do you need pajamas
Staying the night, girl you promised it
I hide in the cave like Osama did
I’m blowing a bag in the diamond district
You need me like dollars that are owed to you
Money and me are the same, but I just don’t fold for you
Run me your body, I’ll put a Range on the road for you
I don’t know what you were told but I ain’t mad at you baby
Chorus: Lil Yachty
If I seen you out, me too would be up on you crazy
Diamond in the rough
You look as good as Oprah's bank account
I just wanna take you out

[Verse 1]
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I feel blue
Some days I just wanna black out
Everything I felt for you

Even though I take your picture
Everywhere I go
I use it for a coaster
And drink the overflow

[Verse 2]
Some days I make a lot of money
And give it all away
To take my mind off the tangerine color
Of your négligée

Beggars can't be choosy
And they don't know how to serve
You got a different phone number
And a lot of nerve

[Outro]
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I miss you too
Ow! Welcome to the New Power Generation
The reason my voice is so clear
Is there's no smack in my brain

I know there is a heaven, I know there is a hell
Listen to me people, I got a story to tell
I know there was confusion lightning all around me
That's when I called his name don't you know he found me
No! Is what Spooky Electric say, it's not OK
But I know love is the only way till my dying day
No, 'til my dying day I'll be OK
Cause Lovesexy is the one 'til my day is done
Hundalasiliah

Boni! What you've got to say?
Alright y'all
Here's what I want you to do
And I want everybody doin' it
Now, raise your hand up, straight in the air
Swing it to the right, savoir faire
Up on the two, swing on the four
Everybody on the dancefloor
Everybody, let's do it some more
(Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho
Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho)
Eric!
Raise your hand up, straight in the air
Say no

Say no (No - if you can't find your way - everybody say)
Say no (No - if you're afraid, everybody ain't got it made)
Say no  (if you want a drug other than the God above
No - if you need a drink every single day
Blow that devil away!
Say yes)

(Yes) if you want this feeling called love
(Yes) if you want it now raise your hand you the man above
(Yes) Up on the two, swing right on the four
We want everybody to open this door!
Say no - if you don't want to live life under the gun
(I know) We know a better way to have some fun
(I know) I know - there is a heaven and a hell
I know there is a heaven and a hell
Oh can you hear me baby
Can you hear me baby?
Listen
You know everybody is always talking about change
Now don't get me wrong
Change can be beautiful
Some things are ment to stay the same you know

If this were our last night
Here on this planet
How would you feel
What would you say
Pretend that you never
Ever will see me
After tonight, after today
And I tell me you rather fight
And hold the grudge against me
Instead of makin’ love tonight
Ooh is that what you sayin baby

I never be flawlеss
Never be pеrfect
No matter how bad you want me to be
I'll be your hero
As soon as you let go
And stop having me in your fantasy
Let's just live life
Let’s just have fun
Maybe in time we can be as one
But if we never do then that's okay
And all and all I'm tryna say is
I ain't gonna change (oh no)
Just being someone else is too damn hard
And I don't want you to change (oh no)
Cause I take you just the way you are
And ooh, I never wanted anything more
And I didn't understand before
But now I do
All that I ask is, just be you

Now what if tomorrow came and I change
And you started doing things that you claim
Would be better
What if I did whatever
To put your mind to ease that we'd always be together
Would that make you satisfied
To have me home every night
Knowing that I really miss the lights
Could you live with yourself?
If that'd happen babe

Tell me where is the girl
The one who used to standin
As the light in my world
Where is she at
Cause I want her back
Can we go back
Cause who I’m looking at
Forgot how to love
I want the one that gave me love
The one that I could go to
Who didn’t used to trip on all the little things
Baby I'm just sayin"
That change ain’t always healthy goes
I ain't gonna change (oh no)
Just being someone else is too damn hard
And I don't want you to change (oh no)
Cause I take you just the way you are
And ooh, I never wanted anything more
And I didn't understand before
But now I do
All that I ask is, just be you

I’m not tryna fight
I'm just tryna grow
But in my own time
And if you didn't know
I care
And I don't want nobody but you
You gotta let me love you
In the way I know
I never let you go
If you feel the same
Baby then I'll stay
But don't make me change

I ain't gonna change (oh no)
Just being someone else is too damn hard
And I don't want you to change (oh no)
Cause I take you just the way you are
And ooh, I never wanted anything more
And I didn't understand before
But now I do
All that I ask is, just be you
I ain't gonna change
Baby hear me out
Girl you make my day
You had all my life
I gave everything
Just to make it right
I'm so tired of fighting
Every every every every night
Never wanted anything more
And I didn't understand it before
But now I do
All that I ask is, just be you

Fallen on me

But now it's clear as water
Burn from chlorine

If you can't see what my eyes see
I don't know, no longer now

Fresh as the day

You can see that it is pure as water
As pure as water
As a father and his newborn daughter
As pure as water

[Intro]
Signals low, it’s alright
I'll be your satellite
Back and forth, day and night
Bouncy ball is what we're like

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly into the sun, crash into the sea
Like an aeroplane or a submarine
We won't let go, we won't let go
Don’t you know?

[Chorus]
We go up, we go down
Touch the ceiling, touch the ground
You and I keep on going
Through the motions like we're floating
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down

[Verse]
Me and you, you and me
Changing my chemistry
Every time you look at me
I'm feeling your gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly into the sun, crash into the sea
Like an aeroplane or a submarine
We won't let go, we won't lеt go
Don’t you know?

[Chorus]
We go up, we go down
Touch the cеiling, touch the ground
You and I keep on going
Through the motions like we're floating
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down
Uh-oh-uh, up and down

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-oh, up, up, up
Down, down, down, d-d-down
Down, down, down, d-d-down
Uh-oh, up, up, up

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly into the sun, crash into the sea
Like an aeroplane or a submarine
We won't let go, we won't let go
Don’t you know?

[Chorus]
We go up, we go down
Touch the ceiling, touch the ground
You and I keep on going
Through the motions like we're floating
Uh-oh-uh, up and down

[Outro]
Wha-wha-what
Down, down, down, d-d-down
Down, down, down, d-d-down
Uh-oh up and down
Uh-oh up and down

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
(Who the hell is Carlo?)
Fuckin' with these bitch ass outsiders, man
Fuck 'em, look
Look, look

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Lou pulled up on me, so we poured up a Kobe Bryant
Stacked up all my empty Wock' pints, it's taller than a giant
Almost didn't graduate school, I was so defiant
Bored as hell, I think me and my bitch finna hit Miama
Damn, dawg, I meant Miami
I'm tongue-twisted, keep my gun lifted, just to be specific
10 milli bullets, ain't no running from a nigga slug
Cleaning sessions with my gun, the only time I talk to judge
Fucked a bitch, I saw her on TV, but it's not The Grudge
Nigga so tough in them skinnies, button 'bout to bust
Glock ain't got no silencer, but I call this bitch a silencer 'cause when I shoot this bitch at this nigga, bet the nigga hush
Brother pull up in that 'Ghini
Yeah, same color as a Zucchini (Hmm)
Why would I fuck on bro bitch, my bitch better, yeah, off her bikini
Shit, smoke on a nigga like Hickory
Pull a FN out the bag, get on trickery
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: KrispyLife Kidd]
Done wearing the big B's, I'm pulling the J's out
Snatch a bitch wig off like, "Pull your fade out"
Retired from the K, I run fades now
And raw-dogged your baby mama, what you gon' say now?
From Flint, if the water gon' make it bad, it can get ugly
Twelve o'clock, my trap Rush Hour, ask for Chris Tucker
Shot dawg, trying to take a shot, I'm a fifth buster
You don't never get props, you a dick sucker
How the fuck you gon' keep sliding and not hit nothing?
If a nigga in the radius, I'ma flip somethin'
My bitch got a OnlyFans, I get a tenth of it
I'm a pimp, I fucked her and like six cousins

[Verse 3: RMC Mike]
Drinking lean for ten years the cause of my big stomach
Pop you with a gun inside a gun, it got a kid on it
That bitch was all gold with a sandpaper grip on it
Girly say she knew I can fuck from the hip motions
Sixty racks for my new kit, look like I'm moving up
Don't drive fast coming down my block, I might shoot it up
Put a whole gram on the table, watch Unc oot it up
They say I've been acting real stiff, it's time to loosen up
Niggas out here drinking cut lean, trying to act high
Nigga, you be coming off the bench, I'm the franchise
Fell in love with a blasian bitch, she got cat eyes
Me, Yachty, Ray, Kidd, and Rio the fab five

[Verse 4: Babyface Ray]
All my niggas in the street, don't know no rap guys
Holy water from my jeweler, I got baptized
F's on my hip, I got F's on my hat now
Fear of God, demons on the Chally, see the Scat down
My son got a bankroll bigger than niggas
Nigga playing crazy, put his ass in the blender
Blend game crazy, take a half to a chicken
We are not the same, this Dior on my Dickies
Codeine Cowboy
Ask around, lot of noise
Draco in the whip, ride with me, I'm a Choppa Boy
Purple in my cup, jewels dancing, bitch, I'm BlocBoy
Nigga reach for my shit, get popped for it

[Verse 5: Rio Da Yung OG]
I ain't with Tez, but I ain't throwing hands, I'm a GlockBoy
The first thing I ever bought my son was a Glock toy
Bro riding in a rental with three cannons, he a hot boy
Michael Jordan, Glock 23 with twenty-two, the other Glock Curry
Rrr, that's how the 'Cat sound
Mike got the Glock in the club, but they ain't pat him down
I'm with the Drank God, he could possibly pull some Act' out
I'm on the South side, with a apostrophe in the crack house
Eighteen hundred dollar bag, pull a Glock out it
You say you a real drinker, pull some snot out
Two K's laying on the couch, I put the Glock out
Bitch bent over trying to tie her shoes, pulled my cock out
Used to have the standard clip, I got a mop now
Shit, gang, what we pouring? I got a pop now
Nigga put the gun down, you getting get knocked out
Seen the opps at the store, hopped out a droptop with chop out
My big homie got a couple keys, we can't get locked out

[Verse 6: DC2Trill]
Everybody know you really a bitch, put that Glock down
Nigga came as the shooter, but he got shot down
Ever since the cash came legit, I'm buying opps now
Nigga shook his drank up, it made the pop sound
The lean plug finna retire, I need a doc now
Hop up out the car and bang-bang like he Pops now
Three-five in a Grabba leaf, this ain't no cigar
Pull up in my hood fresh as hell like a trap star
All a nigga do is talk fibs, he a cap star
Nigga can't tell me shit about no drank, I done drunk Barre

[Verse 7: Icewear Vezzo]
Yeah, scurvy nigga with the pints, I cut raw
Untrustworthy, I can't get a plug 'cause I'll run off
Thirty hanging out the Glock, I up 

[?]
Twenty-nine shots went out the head, this bitch one off
Got jumbo bezel, wanna bet? I can't find my hand
Shady nigga, pop a Xan', I'll rob my friend
Sixty thousand every play, every time I land
Chopper big, hanging down my leg, it can't hide in my pants
Yeah, I done Chrome Heart me (Bitch)
I'll take a nigga chain at his own party (Pussy)
Real hitter, fuck a shooter, got a whole army (Phew)
Nigga soft, never caught a body, you just told stories (You lying)
I woke up and cashed a Wraith, I ain't tell nobody (No cap)
I heard niggas took your shit, you ain't tell nobody (Better do something)
If this rap shit fail, I'll sell more Wocky (Yeah)
You lame, niggas treat you like a hoe, better kill somebody (Kill something)

[Intro]
Open your I
The real you
Get off the slave ship

[Verse 1]
The culture made me
There isn't too much that amaze me
There isn't too much that can faze me
Awoke and awake how I stay B
I'm freeing my people from slavery
While rappers are looking for slavery
Losing their bravery, spitting the crazy

[Salvers always do to these babies]
Knowledge reigning supreme and
Look how I'm gleaming, never deceiving
Steady achieving, better believe it
When I'm MCing I rock for a reason
I'm not with the treason, rappers be thieving
Money is what they believe in
I'm bringing the heat, they're bringing the freezin'
Time to switch up the season
Above and beyond, I'm way too advanced these rappers ain't standing a chance
I give 'em a glance, they pissin their pants
I'm waking them up from their trance
I rock like an avalanche, in a battle stance I don't have to dance
K to the R to the S-ONE is the best one, it's unanimous
Now that I got your attention, here's the direction
Here's what I came to mention
Slavery is still in effect, it's economic, prison is just an extension
Free yourself from working for pension
Free yourself from doubting and guessing
Free yourself, your mind is a weapon
This ain't a song it's a lesson

[Chorus]
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye

[Verse 2]
Yo
Time for my people to raise up
Time for our leaders to face up
Policies ain't gonna save us
Following them will enslave us
A black president did it change what
Looking around it's the same rut
So many people just say stuff
Looking around like lame ducks
Year after year it's the same shit
"Vote for me, I'm gonna change it"
All of them read from the same script
Look at this, this is some fake shit
They lying but you just take it
The lights and the flash they crave it
They teach the class to obey it
For real this is a slave ship
Like citizenship is a slave ship
Like scholarship, this is a slave ship
The way that we really obey shit, we going along with enslavement
You'll never be free because they made you
You're walking and talking like they do
It's really exactly how slaves do, believing in shit that just ain't true
This is the truth that will save you
This is the door to escape through
The music is just to relate to
But really they trying to break you
For real they trying to take you
Cause slavery that's what they do
You hate yourself 'cause they hate you
Be the real you, not the fake you

[Chorus]
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye
You have got to open your eye

[Outro]
Open your I
The I that comes after H
Your I
Your being
Open it up
Aight let's go to that next joint
Give me something raw and hard

[Intro: 24hrs]
Lil niggas gotta sit down or get down, yeah

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
'24, Chevy, this shit for the big dogs
Lil dog you sit down, my dog keep big rounds
"20, I wanna lick you like you ice cream"
Fell in love with marijuana, I'm a big fiend
I took Cash under my wing 'cause my dog got potential
Bad bitch, independent, why would I control her?
Money gettin' larger and it feel I'm gettin' older
I just poured a Four in a pineapple soda
Jimmy Carter, ATL, we used to run the big door
Me and Ricky ruled back when we would do the kick doe
Boosie, that's a big dog, and I respect that
Money where my mouth at, and lately that's where my check at
My niggas never been the type to try to back down
Vibes at the crib, Dolla $ign in the background
"20 you know YG, can we go to Bompton?"

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Too much McQueen, it's gon' really turn to somethin'
Believe in your dreams, you could really turn to somethin'
Too much McQueen, it's gon' really turn to somethin'
Believe in your dreams, you could really turn to somethin'

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, got 'em upset
Half a hundred M's, that's in one check
If you ain't talking money, switch the subject
If you ain't talking money, switch the subject
Only rep the gang, that's one set
Knew she was a hoe, she just ain't done it yet
If you ain't talking money, switch the subject, yeah
Convertible Vette, got my name in the headrest
Put my feet up, smoking a J, let my legs rest
Shorty say I'm on her mind, headset
You and her suck me up, y'all both neck and neck
You get mad when I cuss you out in public
Could have that life, it's the hustle you in love with
Every other day, make sure the bank get deposits
All blue ragtop riding down Slauson

[Chorus: 24hrs & (Wiz Khalifa)]
Too much McQueen, it's gon' really turn to somethin'
(Rose gold AP and that bitch bussin')
Believe in your dreams, you could really turn to somethin'
(Whole p of KK, just got it through customs)
Too much McQueen, it's gon' really turn to somethin'
(Seven hundred horses wanna race? I'ma dust 'em)
Believe in your dreams, you could really turn to somethin'
(All my lowriders sittin' up like it's doing crunches)

[Verse 1]
Are you with me for real, do you love me all the time?
Even when you're in your head baby, even when you’re in your mind
Breaking open the seal, let me see what's inside
Want to crawl into the dark spaces, hold them up into the light

[Pre-Chorus]
Highs and lows your chemicals, I'm coming close to overdose
I can only stay this high, so long, so long, oh

[Chorus]
So if I fall baby
I’m gonna take you down
Only love gonna save us now
If I fall, then you're going down with me
So if I fall
Let me live on hollow ground
In your arms where I'm safe and sound
If I fall, thеn you're going down with me

[Post-Chorus]
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Eе-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee

[Verse 2]
Tell me what do you see when you look into my eyes
Is there a flicker of a lost lightning?
Or are you riding for the sky?
And when the water recedes and the ocean's on the rise
Will you see it through the storm's passing?
Are you running from the tide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Highs and lows your chemicals, I'm coming close to overdose
I can only stay this high, so long, so long, oh

[Chorus]
So if I fall baby
I'm gonna take you down
Only love gonna save us now
If I fall, then you’re going down with me
So if I fall
Let me live on hollow ground
In your arms where I’m safe and sound
If I fall, then you're going down with me

So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love
Won't you call out my—

[Part II: "Starboy"]

[Intro]
I'm a, I'm a starboy

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid, oh

I witch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Part III: "The Hills"]

[Verse]
Your man on thе road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna gеt you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me
When I'm ****** up, that's the real me, babe

[Part IV: "Can't Feel My Face"]

[Verse]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "you'll never be alone", oh, oh, woo

[Chorus]
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)

Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush, girl, when you're alone

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby

[Verse]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

[Part VII: "Earned It"]

[Verse 1]
You make it look like it's magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to bein' used

[Pre-Chorus]
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you

You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it

On that lonely night (Lonely night)
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush (Fell in love)
It made us believe it was only us (Only us)
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah

[Part IX: "Blinding Lights"]

[Verse]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just calling back to let you know
I could never say it on the phone
Will never let you go this time
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Call myself miss Raggedy Ann
Cause somebody who used to love me has left go my hand
Who used to play with me sometimes (who used to play)
Who used to kiss me so sweet, I'd hear all kind of chimes
To have been loved once so grand
Now all around just like the sand, yeah
Miss Raggedy Ann (oh, yeah)
Oh yeah
You're like a child with a, a brand new toy
You found yourself another girl and I've got to find me a boy
Who pick me up and warms me with love (who pick me up)
Who never push me aside with one quick jog
Who dress me up better than you ever could
And who love no stand, little miss Raggedy Ann (oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah, little miss Raggedy Ann (oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah, little miss, little miss Raggedy Ann (oh, yeah)
Strangle your darling with diamonds
Drown her in sparkling champagne
Dresses from all the sublime ones
Will drive the lady insane

Oh Mediterranean villa
Wears down resistance for life
And then shroud your endowed in Chinchilla
You’re just about free now, who she’s too weak to see now

So finish her off, tell her you love her
And that’s how to murder your wife
Smother that girl in all of that Chinchilla
You’re just about free now, who she's too weak to see now

So finish her off, tell her you love her
And that’s how to murder your wife

Just smother that girl down in Chinchilla
Ooh, and that’s how you bump off your wife
Just smother her down in those minks and Chinchilla
And that’s how you murder your wife

There's nothing you can do, 'cause I'm already hooked

This love is more than just a night, a night
And you can't tell me nothing

Lyrics from snippet

My Smith & Wesson got you laying in some alley messy
Got your family lookin for your ass on sally jessy
We squashed beef no more and you ain't breathin' no more
Leavin' your skull split like Steven Seagel
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a madhouse
So I don't get offended when I hear my city bad-mouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and dead it
And leave you with more shit missin' then a Lil Kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryna get paid
You'll get your crib sprayed with twenty-seven bullеts in your rib cage
Get the gagе, cock it back, empty them pockets, Jack
Or I'mma send you flyin' like a rocket pack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib, steal your shit and lock it back
Ten year old kids be standin' on the blocks with gats
Just for living nowadays...

[Refrain: Frank Ocean]
Bitch, don't slam my Bentley doors
It cost me plenty money
Bitch, don’t slam my Bentley doors
It cost me plenty money
Bitch, don't slam my Bentley doors
It cost me plenty money
Bitch, don't slam my Bentley doors
It cost me plenty money

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips lock
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it’s awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Feels like I'm livin' a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag, you got a nigga sprung (Yeah)

[Refrain: Frank Ocean]
Bitch, don't slam my Bentley doors
It cost me plenty money
Bitch, don't slam my Bentley doors
It cost me plenty money

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips lock
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can’t believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Feels like I'm livin’ a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag, you got a nigga sprung (Yeah)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips lock

Feels like I’m livin' a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag, you got a nigga sprung (Yeah)
Follow your heart where it leads you (where it leads you)
Give your love to the one, the one who needs you (the one who needs you)
Darling, I'll understand and I'll step aside
I won't stand in your way if you're not satisfied (satisfied)

Follow, follow your heart, you know what's best for you (you know what's best for you)
And I love you much, too much, to try and stop you (too much to stop you)
But if you ever, ever, ever find that you are unhappy, yeah
Follow your heart back to me, yeah

Only the one you love can hurt you (can hurt you)
Only the one you trust in most of all (most of all)

Or tear you all apart
Only the one you love can fool you (can fool you)
Only the one you who's closest to your heart (to your heart)
And that's cause you can't believe
He ever would deceive
Or leave you or let you fall or let you die (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Strangers can harm you
It's been proved many times before
Only the one you love can hurt you
But his hurt makes you lovе him more and more (more and morе, more and more)
But his hurt can makes you love him more and more (more and more, more and more)
Every little hurt makes you love him more and more and more and more
Sitting here thinking
I'm trying to write a song
If I don't get me a hit soon
I won't be here long
I got a lyric writer
Got me a piano man
And we're making these words
Just as tight as we can
Now we want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give us a whole lot of soul
Now, hey little boy
Come over here with me
And you show me how
To do that dance called the plip
Can you show me how to wobble?
Can we do it together?
Come on and lеt's bend over
Come on and lеt's shake a tail feather
We want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give me a whole lot of soul
Soul (soul), soul (soul)
Soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
Now, how am I doing? (Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright? (Doing alright now)
I got this song (doing alright now)
And I got this boy (doing alright now)
I got a piano man (ah, ah, ah)
And a great big band (ah, ah, ah)
Now, I wanna hear the trumpets (ah, ah, ah)
Blowing out loud
Let me see the action
Coming in from the crowd
And take me, rock by my hand (doing alright now)
A little bit of soul, and
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
Tell me how am I doing?
(Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?
(You're doing alright now)
Tell me how am I doing?
(You're doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?
Her little heart went to Loveland
His little heart stayed at home
Her little heart gave all the love it could impart
His little heart gave none
She took the road to forever
Would she leaving? Never
Maybe she wasn't too clever
But when love finds one it blinds one
He made her journey so exciting
Oh, how the world spun around
Locked in his embrace, lost in time and space
But his never left the ground
This little girl is a sad little girl
Who must endlessly roar
Her little heart went to Loveland, baby
Because his cold heart stayed home
N the land of my dreams
You're sweeter than ever before
In the land of my dreams
You love me so much more
I am over here so I'll stay, you'll never stay
If they could only be real (if they could only be real)
Instead of just in my head
In the land of this wonderful dream (wonderful dream)
I imagine you all so close
Telling all of the girls who love you to
You love me the most (love me the most)
And when you walk by, I start to laugh of dream and glow
Cause when I wanna be with you
I close my eyes and all way I go, go, go (the way I go)
In the land of my dreams
Where it's give and take
Give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
Give your, give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
Give your love to me (give your love to me)
But some should get out our way
I'm still with you because you merely happen to be someone
Who used to have a heart that beat like mine did for you
Who used to share a dream we spoke of so often
Not knowing then it never would come true
Now we're sorry, some of the things we said
Though they were true then, they believe now they're dead
But I still can't forget what you used to mean to me
So now we'll go out (now we'll go out)
Pretending we care (pretending we care)
Until one of both find (one of both find)
That, that somebody who (somebody who)
Who you love just enough (love just enough)
To leave our love behind
Now, there's not enough love for us to leave off
And I'm not the one who wants to be the one to say goodbye
But everytime I stop and remember
How you were, it just makes me cry
Now we're sorry for some of those things we said
Though they were true then, they believe that not that day
But I (still can't forget)
I still can't forget (still can't forget, still can't forget)
What you used to mean to me (still can't forget)
To me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, well, days turn to weeks, months turn to years (Years)
Pain turn to love, love turn to fear (Fear)
Who do I turn to? Gotta learn to steer (Steer)
There will be tears when the images of her appear ('Pear)
I'm out of my mind, inside my thoughts (Thoughts)
Everybody had stories we forgot ('Got)
I just wanna fly, I don't wanna fall (Fall)
I've been gettin' by, but she don't wanna call (Call)
Everybody dies, everybody lives (Lives)
All I do is try, never will I quit (Quit)
Money in my pocket, bitches on my dick (Dick)
Always in the office, always on a trip (Trip)
Try to take my time, but I'm in a rush (Rush)
When I closе my eyes, I can feel your touch (Touch)
In this void of paranoia, who will I trust? (Trust)
Had to break it down just to build it up

[Chorus]
Gotta brеak it down just to build it up
Gotta break it down just to build it up
Gotta break it down just to build it up
Gotta break it down just to build it up
Gotta break it down just to build it up
Gotta break it down just to build it up
Gotta break it down just to build it up
Just to build it up, just to, just to build it up

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Comfortable in pain, comfortable in bliss (Bliss)
Numb it all away, trouble with my bitch (Bitch)
Puddles of the rain love me, never slips (Slip)
Gotta save the day, superhero this (This)
I could fly away, shit, I'm in the clear (Clear)
I could hide my face, I could disappear ('Pear)
I could hit the enemy that's in the mirror (Mirror)
We could make a memory, this is the year (Year)
Unconditional, will you take me home? (Home)
As long as I'm with you, then I ain't alone ('Lone)
Ain't happy with the world, we can make our own (Own)
Every king need a queen, I'ma save a throne for you (For you)
You're so incredible and I adore you (You)
So many layers to your soul, your eyes are just a portal (Portal)
You say that my love a little bit too much (Much)
But I had to break it down just to build it up (Up)

[Chorus]
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Gotta break it down just to build it up (Up)
Just to build it up, just to, just to build it up

[Chorus]
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I’ll be here
Ain't no big deal to say my love is real
When you reach out I'll be there

[Verse 1]
Please don’t be afraid to look me in the eye
Sad time is gone I got no tears to cry
Don't say you don't know I'm right
When I say we'll get by

[Chorus]
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
Ain't no big deal to say my love is real
When you reach out I’ll be there

[Verse 2]
Nobody makes mе feel the way that you do
Night time’s such a thrill when I spеnd it with you
Ask me what is on my mind
So I can tell you true

[Interlude]
(Ain't no big deal, my love is for real)
I love you still
(Ain’t no big deal, my love is for real)

Sad time is gone I got no tears to cry

When I say we'll get by

[Outro]
(Ain't no big deal, my love is for real)

[Verse 1]
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

[Pre-Chorus]
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right, it's a sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
But my friends keep telling mе to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advicе
Please

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love, so, please

[Interlude]
Daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy

[Bridge]
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love, so, please

[Interlude]
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Don't you stop loving me, daddy (Papa don't preach)
I know, I'm keeping my baby

[Verse 1]
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes, it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Intro]
Hey
What?
Listen

[Verse 1]
I've had other guys, I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before until you walked through my door
I've had other lips, I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go, you're the one for me, baby
This I know, 'cause it's...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
I'vе heard all the lines, I'vе cried oh-so-many times
Those teardrops, they won't fall again, I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear, those words whispered in your ear
I said...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

[Bridge]
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's...

[Refrain]
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's (True love, baby)

True love, oh baby, true love it's true

[Verse 3]
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about

Those words whispered in your ear, I said

[Bridge]
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye

Don't you know, don't you know that it's...

[Chorus]
True love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)

[Intro]
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he callеd to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayеd that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Bridge]
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Te dijo, te amo (La Isla Bonita)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Él dijo que te ama (Spanish lullaby)

[Verse 1]
Cigarettes and cold sweat
Wakin' up in your bed
Seven nights of regret
I just wish that I could forget
I wish that I could forget
Talkin' all of them lies (Mmm)
And doin' all of them lines (Mmm)
Said I'm just yours, and you're mine (Mmm)
But you're just one of them guys, yeah
You're just one of them guys

[Chorus]
Should've left your house and put on all my clothes
Should've hid my feelings, but I let 'em show
You don't gotta tell me, I already know
You are a new low, low, low, low, low, low
Should've left your house and put on all my clothes
Should've hid my feelings, but I let 'em show
You don't gotta tell me, I already know
You are a new low, low, low, low, low, low

[Post-Chorus]
Now I know, yeah, I know
Now I know
You are a new low, low, low
Now I know, yeah, I know
You are a new low, low, low

[Verse 2]
You got thousands of problems (Mmm)
I'm never gon' be one of them (Mmm)
Seven nights of regret, yeah (Mmm)
And you're the worst of them yet, yeah, yeah
You're the worst of them yet
Your love was ecstasy
Came down so easily
Too much even for me, yeah
And you're the worst of them yet, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're the worst of them yet, uh

[Chorus]
Should've left your house and put on all my clothes
Should've hid my feelings, but I let 'em show
You don't gotta tell me, I already know
You are a new low, low, low, low, low, low
Should've left your house and put on all my clothes
Should've hid my feelings, but I let 'em show
You don't gotta tell me, I already know
You are a new low, low, low, low, low, low

[Post-Chorus]
Now I know, yeah, I know
Now I know
You are a new low, low, low
Now I know, yeah, I know
You are a new low, low, low

[Intro]
Don't walk away
Don't walk away, away
Don't walk away
Don't walk, baby, don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away again
Don't walk away
Don't walk
Baby, don't walk away

[Verse 1]
Said you can go fuck somebody
I did not say to cuff somebody
Still, you went and you found somebody
Bitch, I thought there was nobody
I'm on my lonely
I'm on some fuck everybody
I'm on some just let it cool
Put you on this pedestal
Like, "Look what I did, look what I did, look what I did"
I made you a star, gave you your start, look what I did
Made you who you are, that's why you rock your style like this
And all of your friends will still tell you that I'm him
I'm him, this nigga that you been looking for
The one that you wanna be cooking for, I'm him
This nigga that you be textin' with
The one that you wanna be sexin' with, I'm him (Don't walk away)
Yes, I'm him, yes, I'm him (Don't walk away)
Even though I talk crazy, get under your skin, I'm him (Don't walk away)
Sent you to the streets, I want you back (Don't walk)
'Cause all of these niggas that play with thе ball and rap gon' treat you like crap (Baby, don't walk away)
And this is not the placе for that and this is not something you're built for (Don't walk away)
You are not built for that (Don't walk away)
No, you are not built for that (Away)
Imagine seeing me out and (Don't walk away)
Having to act like
Like we don't even see each other like we don't even need each other (Don't walk)
When you know I'm needing you back (Baby, don't walk away)
It's tearing my soul to pieces
I sent you out to the streets and
Now I made my bed, gotta sleep in it
And now I need you back in my home and
Now I need you back in my sheets and
Now I need you back in my arms and
All of these R&B songs are startin' to make sense to me
Like lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
'Cause I have nobody to call my own
Heard that song on the radio, it made me sick
Then I realized that it's half legit
'Cause then I realized that it was accurate
'Cause I'm so fuckin' lonely
I'm so fuckin' lonely
The woman I left you for, tried to test you for it
Is somewhere out with some nigga from Atlanta and she's probably out there fucking on me
Nah, fuck it, I'll be real, that bitch is fucking on me
And I feel so stupid for leaving you
'Cause every time I told you lies
You looked inside my face with these eyes
And you told me, "I believe in you"
Knowing damn well I didn't want you to

[Interlude]
Shawty, I think that, that's where you twist it
Feel like you have this thing in your heart where you think I'm just cold
I feel like I just never got you the chance to show you my heart
Nigga, this shit yearns for you

[Verse 2]
Look, I know it's scary to love me
Clearly, I'm aware of all the rumors you hear when they judge me
I call 'em blessings, testimonies, some call 'em unlucky
I'm standing with my peers, sipping liquor
And I can tell that none of these people love me
It's crazy, who's there when I'm facing twenty-two years and I need someone to hug me?
It's nobody but the ones that love me
And you love me, but do you?
'Cause I'm seeing angers and emotions that's running all through you
I know you feel it too, but fuck, that's the air of the moment
You feel it clearly, don't it?
You talking louder when you quiet, but I'm the only one that hear it, don't it?
Know when you feel things, I know your real pain
I know the real you
I hope you found somebody new that does you better than me
Really I'm lying, but I just say that 'cause it sound like it's the mature thing to say
The last time we spoke, I felt like I had more things to say but I just didn't
So I just let you talk until you finished
It's things like that to this day that piss me off
Moments I wasted
You gave me warm love when I was too cold to embrace it
I guess at times, I felt like I would have to face it
That one day you'd find somebody better than me at these mazes, look
The way it ended's not how it started
I felt like every left out creature when Noah's Ark had departed
Finding somebody new, I contemplated, plus I thought it
I know you thought it too
That almost led me into cheating, but the times I tried to cheat I'm blocked with thoughts of you
Caught up in my past ways, conflicted with our last days
Couple things you said to me never left from my brain
I just hope you still mean 'em, 'cause I'll never get between 'em
Look, higher hopes and heavy hearts
Funny how we came from fresh starts
To now us arguing 'bout who what and who gets parts
And who's really leaving
You say you hate me and you don't love me
But, shit, you don't even believe it when you talk like that
Quit acting like I'm not your only friend
And like I'm not the one with good intentions that I intend
I fucked your heart up, but I tried to make amends
For the times that I offend, I apologize dearly

[Outro]
Oh, baby, don't, don't be afraid
You can trust me
Tell her you get off
Cut him off
Can you trust me, just trust me, just trust me?
Can you trust me, just trust me, just trust me?

[Verse 1]
Bathing in the light around us
Praying for the night to comfort thee
Dancing on the coals below us
Praying for the flood to set us free

[Chorus]
And the planet is still turning
And the faces are still burning
And the mothers with their children search for the rain

[Verse 2]
Drifting through the plains before us
As it turns to dust before our eyes
Pleading for a god to pour us
Just a little bit of rain from an empty sky

[Chorus]
And the planet is still turning
And the faces are still burning
And the mothers with their children search for the rain

[Instrumental]

Yeah

[Outro]
Who will bring the rain? Woah
Who will bring the rain? Hey
Who will bring the rain? No, no, no
Who will bring the rain? Woah
Who will bring it?
Who will bring the rain?
All my people in the crowd

'Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love

[Post-Chorus]
Goddess of love, I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, I wonder if this could be love

[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
'Cause you're out of this world, galaxy, space, and time
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love

[Outro]
Goddess of love, I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
Goddess of love, I wonder if this could be love
(Venus)

[Verse 1]
When a man must walk the devil's road
Churning up the Earth below
He is bound to brothers built by nations
With no pride to call his own

[Chorus]
Woah, the trouble gets so loud
When all of hell tries to drag you down
Woah, the wounded warrior
On this battleground

[Verse 2]
Who is he to think of his survival
When a man must kill his home?
Standing naked in the breast of canyons
Where companions are alone

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Woah, the trouble gets so loud
When all of hell tries to drag you down
Woah, the wounded warrior
On this battleground

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Woah, the trouble gets so loud, gets so loud
Woah, the wounded warrior, warrior

[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Ah, ah, woah

[Verse 1]
Roses in the bush
Cut down at the garden's gate
It was too late
So much has fallen
Sound the broken bells
The priestess amongst us heeds
Bring in the seeds
A garden must grow
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
It has been said
By the likes of the living and the dead
Make your bed
Even sinners go to drink the wine
Break the bread
Woah

[Verse 2]
Prisoners of the king
Are promised their freedom for
Planting a score of infantry vines
From the bowing Earth
Uprises the weeds of war
Caving the floor
A renaissance born
Woah, woah, woah

[Chorus]
It has been said
By the likes of the living and the dead
Make your bed
Even sinners go to drink the wine
Break the bread
Woah

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Woah, it has been said
Yeah, make up your bed
Woah, lay down your head
Woah

[Verse 1]
Can you light my love?
Flames glowing bright as the sun
Deeper than oceans you run
Watch as our world has begun

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mind is a stream of colors
Extending beyond our sky
A land of infinite wonders
A billion light years from here now

[Chorus]
Whoa, hey, light my love
Whoa, hey, light my love

[Verse 2]
I have seen pictures of time
The frames still in motion, I find
A grand revolution outlined
Hate bound by fear will unwind

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mind is a stream of colors
Extending beyond our sky
A land of infinite wonders
A billion light years from here now

[Chorus]
Whoa, hey, light my love
Whoa, hey, light my love

[Instrumental Break]
Oh, hey
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Whoa, hey, light my love
Whoa, hеy, light my love

[Outro]
Ah
Ah
Whoa, hey
Hey, hеy
Whoa, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey

[Verse 1]
Crash against wave upon wave, woah
To strange horizons, ooh
Heel to the mist and the wind, yeah
You wake the movement, ooh

[Chorus]
Woah, as you can tell
This was the age of the caravel
Woah, as you can tell
These are the times you'll remember well

[Verse 2]
Sail to the end of the world, woah
For death or glory, ooh
Bow with your face to the sky, yeah
We are the movement, ooh

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Woah, as you can tell
This was the age of the caravel
Woah, as you can tell
These are the times you’ll remember well

[Instrumental]

Woah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Children with their toys of war
Birthright of death with a fiery breath
Funeral of innocence
Painted up in the red and dressed in lead
We are

[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, woah
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas, Babylon
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Mothers of barbarians, woah
Were your young so spry when they left to die?
We are

[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, woah
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas, Babylon
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Instrumental]

Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, woah
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas, Babylon
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Enter the flow
Dharma, Divine
Interceding signs
Carbon dancing through time
Give me the truth and I will sing on
My universal song
To ask the questions unknown
Is to respond
Woah

Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram

[Chorus]
To comet across the blistering hue
Beyond the spaces of false and true
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

[Verse 2]
You are the land
The sea and the sky, woah
The explanation why
We're tied to all things as one
Rhythm of space
Expansion of soul
A force beyond control
Travelers in time searching for the unknown
Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram

[Chorus]
To comet across the blistering hue
Beyond the spaces of false and true
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

[Instrumental]

Ah sri rama, jayam, ram, ram, ram, ram
Ah sri rama, jayam, ram, ram, ram, ram

[Chorus]
To comet across the blistering hue
Beyond the spaces of false and true
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

[Outro]
Yeah, hey

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All across the west we traveled wayward for
Find the weight of dreams in gold
Heaven sent us here to meet the hallowed shore
To claim the wealth that we had sold

[Chorus]
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind

[Verse 2]
We stole from her a cloak of studded majesty
The queen is dead, we robbed her grave
You can still bathe in the river but it ran dry
And all of us have turned away

[Chorus]
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Lil' Tory
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

[Verse]
How did I let you play me when I'm wavy?
I done made examples of Tracy and Stacy
Bitch, you never loved me, you just loved what I came with
We one and the same, I only liked you 'cause you famous
Can't lie, it was a good time when I met you
Can't lie, we fucked, good time when I stretch ya
Can't lie I know I said you miss me come kiss me
Jump in that oowee, get Goofy, no Disney
Turn to your left, goes, the sex to your lеft side
Heat make hеr nauseous
Baby know that sex be the best when it's toxic
I know you had a good time with that nigga
But just like Dex say I know you haffi bring it to the owner
Badmon persona
Tonguing in that pussy making sure that you a goner
I'ma spin that pussy like a motherfucking doughnut
And I'm not gon' stop fucking until you catch your nut
Until you go nuts, until that clit cream shows up and you say sho'nuff
I was on some, "Less emotion more sex, let's grown up"
I did not realize the shit that I was doing so fucked up
Casamigos, she got me jealous and it's dripping off my ego
That's how we go, weed by the D go
I stroke your ego
Then you drop down and give me deep throat
Tongue sweet though, gave her head and then my bed sheets was sheets soaked
Off lil' mama got me stuck, lil' mama
Am I too? I let you come in when you toxic
Know how much you do and it go up it ain't gon' stop shit
All my friends told me you a dub and you was not shit
But I never listened, I was blind by the thought, ayy
Now that shit is crazy (Crazy), money long as JAY-Z (JAY-Z)
Girl, I knew you back when you was shopping at the Macy's (Macy's)
Now you moving famous (Famous), it don't even make sense (Make sense)
Pussy cost a pretty penny now, plus it pays rent
How did we fall out love? It don't make sense
How did we fall out love? Girl them days went
Listen to me

[Refrain]
So if I ever (If I get to have you)
Get to fuck you one more time (Get to fuck you)
Baby I'll make it better
It better (Said I'll make it better)
Fuck what they say, you're mine still (Fuck what they say you're mine)
You're mine still (Fuck what they say you're mine)
Fuck what they say, you're mine still (Fuck what they say you're mine)
You're still mine (You're mine still)

[Outro]
I even took you out on shopping out at the mall...

[Verse 1]
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting mе
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Plеase, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Intro]
Oh-woah
Oh, oh, you left me
I remember the day that you left me

[Verse 1]
Uh, I still can't believe I believe what you say
You swear shit's gonna change when I know it won't ever
You always lie 'cause this shit still the same
Every time that you hurt me, this time I won't let ya'
We keep on runnin' in circles
You promised me last time that you wouldn't hurt me again
I swear to god I thought I been through the worst, but
This shit hurt so bad, I don't know if I want it again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry, I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry, I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry, I— I just wanna live my life
I just wanna hear it, yeah
I just wanna hear it, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I spend too many days and nights
I wasted all of my time tryna make you love me (Oh yeah)
I should've known that none of this shit was for me (For me, oh)
I can't let you in, never ever again
'Cause every time we fight, you won't stop 'til you win ('Til you win)
Maybe better off friends, maybe better off dead
I don't know anymore (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry, I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry, I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry
I don't wanna see you cry, I— I just wanna live my life
I just wanna hear it, yeah
I just wanna hear it, yeah

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus, Madonna & Both]
Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm-hmm
Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Madonna, Miley Cyrus & Madonna]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do (Uh, yeah)
Tell me everything I'm not but
Please don't tell me to stop
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
And we can't stop (Come on, people) (Hey)
And we won't stop
'Cause we run things, things don't run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Madonna]
(Come on!)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell no"?
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Madonna]
And we won't stop (Tell me love isn't true...)
Can't you see it's we who own the night? (It's just something that we do)
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life? (Tell me everything I'm not)
And we can't stop (Don't you ever tell me love isn't true)
And we won't stop (It's just something that we do)
'Cause we run things, things don't run we (Don't you ever tell me everything I'm not)
We don't take nothing from nobody (But don't ever tell me to stop)
Yeah, yeah
And we won't stop (Tell me love isn't true...)
Can't you see it's we who own the night? (It's just something that we do)
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life? (Tell me everything I'm not)
And we can't stop (Don't you ever tell me love isn't true)
And we won't stop (It's just something that we do)
'Cause we run things, things don't run we (Don't you ever tell me everything I'm not)
We don't take nothing from nobody (But don't ever tell me to stop)
Here we go

[Chorus 2: Miley Cyrus & Madonna]
Please don't, please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Don't you
Ever
Don't ever tell us to stop

[Outro: Miley Cyrus & Madonna & Miley Cyrus]
(Don't you ever) Please don't (C'mon)
Please don't (Break it down)
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Don't you (Ay)
Ever
Don't ever tell us to stop
Don't you ever!
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
You know
You know
You know

[Verse]
Yeah, you don't have to worry about me 

[?]
You don't got to worry cause you know you're the only one
You're the only one, only one, only one

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Outro]
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah

[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night, waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh, oh-oh
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night, waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Break: Taylor Swift]
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
But I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

[Intro]
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you (Huh)
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Outro]
Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
Well, my mistakе, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have thе upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfеct day
Well, I get so confused and frustratеd
Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Oh)

[Outro]
I take a step back, I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

[Verse 1]
Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
’Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Bridge]
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everythi-i-ing?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everythi-i-ing?
Back up, baby, back up
Please, back up, oh, back up
Back up, baby, back up

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby

[Outro]
You said, "Forever and always," yeah

[Verse 1]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Verse 2]
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

[Pre-Chorus]
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Bridge]
I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

[Chorus]
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

[Outro]
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

[Verse 1]
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right, babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Verse 2]
Morning lonelinеss
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Bridge]
You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Outro]
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar

[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
But what I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

[Breakdown]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Outro]
Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh
Today was a fairytale
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know wе weren't perfеct but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 1]
Watch for ‘them tides
Said men over the news
Doomers far out
Their plea was fair and sound
Oh Mama I love you
Strong like I fear devouts
Who never doubt
Their righteous fervor

[Verse 2]
A hundred forty-four, by thousands, waiting for the clear
Oh how sublime
To marvel at an ugly world from home
They made it to midnight
They know they're right
Awake forever

[Chorus]
I see brave men walking hand in hand again
With angels by their sides
Who’ll dare put on a fight?
Happy forever
To make it all in-line
Happy togеther
We shall be finе

[Verse 1]
Hello morning
Now I see you
Cause I am awake
What was once so sweet and secure
Has turned out to be fake

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you can't be scared
Gotta stand up strong
Let'em see what shines in you
Push aside the part
Laying in your heart
Like the ocean is deep, dark, and blue

[Chorus]
You are a golden child
You are a golden child

[Verse 2]
Golden sunshine's
Peeking through the grayness of your mind
Soon it will be in full view
And rain won't stain your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you'll be smart
Look in your heart and see what shines in you
Push aside the part
That feeds you darkness
Like an ocean that's cold and blue

[Chorus]
You arе a golden child
You are a golden child

[Bridge]
You don't havе to be afraid cause time is on your side
And they don't know the power you possess
Or the beauty that's inside

[Outro]
You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child
You are a golden child

[Intro]
Turn my mic up

[Chorus]
Is it insane?
My life's in your love's hands
Is it insane?
You got a hold on me

[Verse 1]
When you're near all of me trembles
Slightest touch and I'm no good
When you walk out my door
I want you more

[Chorus]
Is it insane?
I was the one who called them fools
For being blinded by love
Now it's me who can't break free

[Verse 2]
Even though you're with her
I still feel you in me
And I know when you kiss her
You're wishing that it was me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Is it insane?
Thought you'd be my king
I'd be your queen
It would be complete with a wedding ring
Was that just me imagining? Oh

[Verse 3]
Now I cry like I'm your widow
Without you, I can't sustain
This is my soul's last refrain
And you'rе the one that I blame

[Outro]
Shе can have you now
I just wanna fade away
Sacrifice my life
To relieve this pain
So much pain
Lord, take away the pain
Is it insane?

[Verse 1]
His love is massive
I'm overwhelmed
I told myself I wouldn't fall
But here I am
Falling right where I stand

[Pre-Chorus]
We ran up the highway
Bags in the trunk
Don't think that I can let him leave
This is the drop off
He 'bout to take flight
But this is where he needs to be

[Chorus]
Hold that plane
I-I-I- I can't let him get away
Hold that plane
I-I-I-I can't let him get away
You ain't gotta go out there, there , there
Got everything you need right here, here, here
So hold that plane
I-I-I-I can't let him get away

[Verse 2]
Before it's too late
Need you to know
There ain't no heaven without you
So baby please
Don't go forget about me

[Pre-Chorus]
We ran up the highway
Bags in the trunk
Don't think that I can let him leave
This is the drop off
He 'bout to take flight
But this is where he needs to be

[Chorus]
Hold that plane
I-I-I- I can't let him get away
Hold that plane
I-I-I-I can't let him get away
You ain't gotta go out there, there , there
Got everything you need right here, here, here
So hold that plane
I-I-I-I can't let him get away

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me a reason
What are we doing? Where are you going? Why are you leaving?
Fight, then we break up, kiss and we make up, all in a weekend
We're running in circles baby, and I can't pretend that I feel the same way

[Chorus]
The same way that I used to
Fighting with you on the usual
It don't feel the same
Same way that it used to
You gon' look at me the same
Same way that you used to
You know I'm used too
The same way that I used to
Fighting with you on the usual
It don't feel the samе
Same way that it used to
You gon' look at me thе same
Same way that you used to
You know I'm used too

[Outro]
Give me a reason
What are we do-

[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together?

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Well, I feel in love with a girl one Sunday
She Fell in love with my friend on Monday
My mind was worried, my heart was in trouble

He's her fascination
Her inspiration
And her destination

I was walking down a lonely road one Tuesday
I met a girl, she dates me on Wednesday
On Thursday, we were walking down the aisle
On Friday, we were feeling so fine
Into Saturday into Saturday

She's my fascination
My inspiration
And my destination

I was walking down a lonely road one Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
I met a girl, she dates me on Wеdnesday
On Thursday, we werе walking down the aisle
On Friday, we were feeling so fine

She's my fascination
My inspiration
And my destination

She's my fascination
My inspiration

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse]
Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
I moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name

[Chorus]
What have we done?
Did we fly too high just to get burned by the sun?
No one's to blame
'Cause we called all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost
Star-crossed

[Outro]
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)

Keep on dancin' till the world ends

[Verse 1]
This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good -ish
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Chorus]
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(DJ, what you, what you waiting for?)
Keep on dancin' till the world ends

[Verse 2]
Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearin', I'm noticin' you starin'
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

[Chorus]
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waitin' for?

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
DJ, what you, what you waitin' for?

[Chorus]
See the sunlight, we ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
Keep on dancin' till the world ends

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causin' a commotion
Like a slumber party

Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fucking crazy, go
Go crazy, go

Like a slumbеr party

Taste of your lips, taste of your lips...
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Toxic

Can't come down, can't come down...
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Intro]
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' undеr
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you'rе toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (Toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Outro]
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now

[Verse 1]
I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody еlse
As long as you swear you won't be pissеd when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Verse 2]
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Bridge]
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that, just say we're good

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
(That's never gonna change)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways, oh)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
(Verse 1)
Now the world has turned away
My life gets colder every day
You don't know how it is
I lost all my will to live
You've taken the love I have to give
You don't know how it is

(Chorus)
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

(Verse 2)
Well Sunday comes along with the wind
Every Sunday was spent with him
You don't know how it is
We would watch the flames burn higher
Tеll me Mama started to cry
You don't know how it is
(Chorus)
Thank you Mama, you easе to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

(Verse 3)
Well Sunday comes along with the wind
Every Sunday was spent with him
You don't know how it is
We would watch the flames burn higher
Tell me Mama started to cry
You don't know how it is

(Chorus)
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
(Verse 1)
It's a long long journey
When you're on your own
It's a long long way to travel
When you're all alone
So be careful and you'll find
That you're sure to make good time
'Cause your home
Is the best place you can go

(Chorus)
I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

(Verse 2)
Don't you try and stop me
I made up my mind
I have been to many places
Where they treated me unkind
So be careful and you'll find
That you'rе sure to make good time
'Causе your home
Is the best place that I know
(Chorus)
I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

(Verse 3)
It's a long late evening
And not far to go
You have traveled many miles
But it's nice to know
You're careful, you'll find
That you always make good time
Good time
To the best place you can go

(Chorus)
I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

(Chorus)
I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home
(Verse 1)
The old gates are always locked
By the daughter of the keys
Sad eyes are fixed on the world
From the balcony
While the six o'clock procession
Take their prayer books to the hall
It's sad to see them shed a tear
Inside the convent walls

(Verse 2)
Red mountains around them
Keep out those who'd come
But only birds and wild deer
Share the lives of nuns
For ladies who in kindness
Burn the knowledge they have found
Their knowledge lies inside a hole
Buried in the ground

(Chorus)
For the Sisters of the Cross
Seek the shadows that they have lost
In the walls where their lives
Are protected by God
But the feeling of love
Is somewhere in your bones
Your body is wasted
When it should have been owned
(Verse 3)
The Mother of the mission bells
Has lived here all her life
She never felt the hands of a man
Touch her in the night
And the canopies that cover her
So cold and so afraid
Thinking holy mothers die
Like spinsters in the grave

(Verse 4)
To be single in the chapel
Praying knelt down on your knees
Where the corridors are echoing
Their proud solemnity
And the candlelight against the glass
Plays shadow chasing tricks
As the young girls fall, their eyes in tears
Beside the crucifix

(Chorus)
For the Sisters of the Cross
Seek the shadows that they have lost
In the walls where their lives
Are protected by God
But the feeling of love
Is somewhere in your bones
Your body is wasted
When it should have been owned

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
(Hey)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will livе for younger days
Think of me if evеr you’re afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Bridge]
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, go venture far beyond the shores
Don’t forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Bridge]
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
Oooh, oooh
(Hey, hey)

Oooh, oooh

[Instrumental Outro]

[Percussion Intro]

[Verse 1]
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartache, heartbreaks all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 1]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'causе we're not done yеt
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel (Yeah)
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flew, cut through all over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 2]
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget
And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, look

[Verse]
Don't you ever tell me how I'm 'posed to feel now
I pour a cup and smoke my lungs out just to feel something
Nowadays, it's hard to tell the fake from real ones
Shit, all I ever wanted was some real love

[Chorus]
They asked me why I put the money over everything
'Cause the money never hurt me
They asked me why I'm so closed off, don't say shit
'Causе I don't want no one to hurt me

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm miseducated
Lauryn Hill mistaken
Looking up at the sun, so my mind awakens
I'm running wild, tryna find the light
Tell me, baby, are you with me or just for the night?
I'm hurting, aching
Slowly fading, breaking
The haze is filling my mind, like it's medicating
Playing with fire, 'til our hands are tied
Falling for you's the definition of suicide

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me

[Chorus]
“Never get high off your own supply”
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, high-igh-igh-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My friends say I have a hundred issues
Guess I'm stubborn with you
I'll take it as it comes, as long as I'm coming with you
I'm ill-behaved, I can't be saved
All the advice I was given, I just threw away

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me

[Chorus]
“Never get high off your own supply”
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply

[Bridge]
Mmm (I can’t feel my face, I can’t feel my face)
I can’t feel my face from my mistakes
And all the things I’ve tried to hide
Can’t feel my face, just took one taste
And then we wasted our supply
I can’t feel my face, can’t feel my face
And all the things I, I, I, I can’t feel my face
I can’t feel my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, we fall in love, fall in love
Falling in addiction
You're everything they warned me of
If only I had listened
Why do we overkill, overkill, just to feel alive?
A wise man once told me

[Chorus]
“Never get high off your own supply”
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
Never get high off your own supply
(Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
(high-igh-igh-yeah, high-igh-igh-yeah)
(Own supply, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)
Never get high off your own supply

[Verse 1]
We are runaways, so we misbehave
And your mama warned you to stay away
I don't wanna leave your humanity
But we were fallin' in water and then we found the sea
There's just two of us, and it's true of me
And the lost by the society
Had to sacrifice, had to roll the dice
Had to make our way through hell to get to paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no

[Chorus]
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
(Fueled by desire)
Fueled by desire tonight (Fueled by desire)
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Fueled by desire tonight

[Verse 2]
It's a ritual, they call us criminals
Even back in school, individual
You don't wanna see our reality
'Cause the only thing you see in us is enemy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid of standing out
Not with us or against us, no, no, no

[Chorus]
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Every night we come alive (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We are the children of the sky (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
We're the wicked and the wild (Ooh, oh)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

Fueled by desire
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
(Fueled by desire tonight)
We're the wicked and the wild, wild (Wild)
Dance around the fire, we're fueled by desire tonight

[Bridge]
(Oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh)

[Verse 1]
Hi, nice to meet ya
Everything about ya got me painting pictures
I wanna kiss ya, dying to know how you taste
(Hey!)
You are getting closer, every little step I'm losing my composure
Ooh, to think we're sober
We gotta slow down the pace

[Pre-Chorus]
Wooh-ooh, we got so much time
More than just tonight
But one thing's on my mind
So I'm doing

[Chorus]
Anything to stop myself from loving you
That's what I'm tryna do
But I just wanna see you naked
Anything to stop myself from rushing it
You know I can't resist
'Cause I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked

[Verse 2]
Time, out the meter
In another minute, I'll be underneath ya
I feel the fеver, so much of you on the brain
Say you feel the samе way
I'ma keep you talking all the way to my place
Wait, tap on the breaks
Baby, it's too good to waste

[Pre-Chorus]
Wooh-ooh, we got so much time
More than just tonight
But one thing's on my mind
So I'm doing

[Chorus]
Anything to stop myself from loving you
That's what I'm tryna do
But I just wanna see you naked
Anything to stop myself from rushing it
You know I can't resist
'Cause I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked

[Bridge]
Ice broken, my self control
So thin, no matter what, can't win
(I just wanna see you naked)
Innocent, my self control, so thin, wanna see you again
(I just wanna see you naked)
So I'm doing

[Chorus]
Anything to stop myself from loving you
That's what I'm tryna do
But I just wanna see you naked
Anything to stop myself from rushing it
You know I can't resist (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause I just wanna see you naked

[Outro]
I just wanna see you naked
I just wanna see you naked

[Verse 1]
Cigarettes and loneliness
I lost my way, haven't found it yet
An hour late, still undressed
I feel used, I'm confused, my life's such a mess

[Pre-Chorus]
Who do I turn to when I'm in need?
Who is the person that's there for me?

[Chorus]
Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?

[Verse 2]
My drink is warm, but I'm penniless
It doesn't show in the way I'm dressed
I'm nearing drunk and I lost my phone
Had enough of this club and I can't go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Who do I turn to when I'm in need?
Who is the person that's there for me?

[Chorus]
Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?

[Bridge]
My daddy said, my daddy said, my daddy said
My daddy said, my daddy said, my daddy said
My daddy said, my daddy said, my daddy said
My daddy said, my daddy said

[Chorus]
Oh, daddy
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh-oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?
Oh, daddy (I know, I know, I know, I know)
You taught me a lot of things
Oh-oh, daddy
But you can't get me out of this
Oh, daddy (I know, I know, I know, I know)
Some things I gotta do alone
Oh, daddy
How do I do this without you?

[Verse 1]
Lately, baby, my mind's fixed on you
At the strangest time
Just left another version of you
'Cause he wasn't right

[Pre-Chorus]
Same shit, different day
Tears on aeroplanes
But I can't find my way to you
I taped my broken heart
And it's been fine so far
But I can feel it getting loose

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over the way you move
The way you do the things you do
I'm tryna be strong, I'm tryna move on
But I keep thinking, "What's the use?"
Baby, I'm not over you
I'm not over you

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over you, I'm not over you

[Verse 2]
Never know what you'vе got 'til it's gone
Ain't that the truth?
Baby, right now I am bettеr off alone
'Til I can figure it through
Figure it through, through, through

[Pre-Chorus]
Same shit, different day
You see nothing's changed
Not even how I feel for you
I taped my broken heart
And it's been fine so far
But I can feel it getting loose

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over the way you move
The way you do the things you do
I'm tryna be strong, I'm tryna move on
But I keep thinking, "What's the use?"
Baby, I'm not over you
I'm not over you

[Post-Chorus]
It was him in my bed
But it was you in my head
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
And we know that night after night
I just sit up and cry
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over the way you move
The way you do the things you do
I'm tryna be strong, I'm tryna move on
But I keep thinking, "What's the use?"
Baby, I'm not over you

[Post-Chorus]
It was him in my bed
But it was you in my head
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
And we know that night after night
I just sit up and cry
'Cause I'm not over you, I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

[Verse 1]
I'm still wandering alone
Tryna find a heartbeat in a home
Wishing we were set in stone
Will you wait here when I go?
What's ahead? No one knows

[Pre-Chorus]
When it starts to rain (Starts to rain)
When the seasons change (Seasons change)
When you fade away (Fade away)
My baby (Ooh)
Will I be the same? (Be the same)
Will I speak your name? (Speak your name)
Guess it's hard to say (Hard to say)
My baby, baby

[Chorus]
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living lifе, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, lifе, life (Whoa)

[Verse 2]
I'm still wandering alone
Tryna find a heartbeat in a home
Wishing we were set in stone
Will you wait here when I go?
What’s ahead? No one knows

[Pre-Chorus]
When it starts to rain (Starts to rain)
When the seasons change (Seasons change)
When you fade away (Fade away)
My baby (Ooh)
Will I be the same? (Be the same)
Will I speak your name? (Speak your name)

My baby, baby

[Chorus]
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)
Just living life, life, life (Whoa)

[Verse 1]
It's never gonna wash away
Are we sinners or are we saviours?
Regret the day I heard your name
And your array of bad behaviour

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could

[Chorus]
But I'm hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
Once it starts, it never stops
I need you here to feed my craving
But maybe we should separate
Go different ways
We both need saving

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could

[Chorus]
But I'm hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over

[Bridge]
Untie the knots in my heart-strings
Let me go
Untie the ropes, let my heart see
Irreversible
Yeah, you're deep, you're deep under my skin
Let me go
I'm weak when you leave, my demon
Irreversible

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, if I could walk away from you
If I could, if I could, hmm

[Chorus]
Hung up on your touch
Irreversible now, baby
Nowhere left to run
Irreversible now, baby
Stop, there's a devil in us
Addicted to love
No matter how hard that I fight he will never be undone
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)

[Outro]
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Irreversible, it's over (Ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
Stayin' up 'til the A.M
Call you out on all your bullshit
Whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff
It was sweet before the fall
You and I got comfortable quick
But whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

[Chorus]
If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

[Verse 2]
When you're thinking of the end
You're only hearin' me say, "I love ya"
You don't hear the door you slammed after
You remember all the good stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

[Chorus]
If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

[Break]
(Wrong number)
(Wrong number)

[Chorus]
If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (You got the, you know that you got the)
Wrong number (Na-na-na-na, boy, na-na-na-na)
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

[Intro]
(Ayy, fuck that nigga Haan, man)

[Chorus]
My kindness is both a gift and curse (Uh)
They was tryna knock me down for tryna make it work (Yeah)
All I'm tryna do is go and get what I deserve, but
At least I know the truth is in my heart and that's for certain

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you don't see behind the curtains
People that I used to know is tryna chase the Birkin
Bitches in my DM's that I knew they used to curve me
People I don't know on my Instagram lurkin' (Uh)

[Verse]
Waiting for me to slip up
And if it wasn't love back then, it ain't love
Funny how they all so quick to change up
There is not a soul in this world I can trust
Speculation, oh, speculation
"You done gained a couple followers, congratulations"
Way too much money that I'm makin'
And I'ma die behind mine, you won't ever take it, no

[Chorus]
My kindness is both a gift and curse (Uh)
They was tryna knock me down for tryna make it work (Yeah)
All I'm tryna do is go and get what I deserve, but
At least I know the truth is in my heart and that's for certain

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, you don't see behind the curtains
People that I used to know is tryna chase the Birkin
Bitches in my DM's that I knew they used to curve me
People I don't know on my Instagram lurkin' (Uh)

[Verse 1]
Night falls around 8:15
Looking like I've got nowhere else to be
And I found myself missing the touch of your hand
But it don't mean that I want you back

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'm watching TV
I might be pouring a tall whisky drink
Smoking a freight train of redfield in my heart attack
But it don't mean that I want you back
No, it don't mean that I want you back

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm moving on, and staying strong
Saying that I'm better off
And I'm glad that you're gone
Then I fake a grin and take a sip
Try and tell myself again
I don't care anymore about you

[Verse 3]
So why am I checking my phone
Why am I wondering if you're alone
I keep on trying to answer these questions I'm asking
They can't mean that I want you back
No they don't mean that I want you back

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm moving on, and staying strong
Saying that I'm better off
And I'm glad that you're gone
Then I fake a grin and take a sip
Try and tell myself again
That I don't care anymore about you

[Bridge]
I'm feeling a whole lot of lonely
With no one to hold me tonight
I'm watching the clock as the seconds pass by

[Verse 4 - ending]
You show up at 2:32
And I can tell you've had more than a few
But if you want to, I'll let you climb into my bed
But it don't mean that I want you back
No, it don't mean that I want you back

[Chorus]
Qadir, oh, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?

[Verse 1]
Oh, we have fallen
As a whole
And we're sinking
Down a hole
Without thinking
About our loved ones
Who might be shrinking
Into a sunken space
With glass surrounding
Their powers
That are pounding
In their temple
In their mind
There seems to be a complexity
To being kind
To your space
To your temple
To your neighbors
Who've seen the changes
We all feel change
Some of us wear masks
To hidе the pain
And I just wish I could ask

[Chorus]
Qadir, oh, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mothеr's garden?
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?

[Verse 2]
Oh, hemos sido esclavos
To these systems
That project false beauty
Exorcisms
Burn it out of my body
This dependency don't help nobody
We're sitting in dark rooms
With bags on our heads
Waiting for God to touch us
We just wanna be closer
It's overwhelming
Some of us wear masks
Because some can't adapt
Oh, I just wish I could ask

[Chorus]
Qadir, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
(Oh, oh)
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
Qadir, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
(Oh, oh)
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Qadir, what's the deal now?
What did you plant in your mother's garden?
(Oh, oh)
Qadir, oh, I miss you dearly
What did you plant in your mother's garden?

[Instrumental Break]
Lyrics from snippet:

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Russ]
This electric love's like a Tesla
This a team, where you want?

[...]
Fall in love every time we sex 

[?]
Electricity, baby, nothing else between (Yeah, yeah)
I'm buzzin', buzzin'

[Verse: Russ]
Woah, never felt like this before
This that if you know, you know
It's about to go down, down
Eight shots of Don at my estate
Now my chains are on your face
How we end up on the ground, ground?
Somethin' 'bout tequila at 4 A.M. is deadly
Arguments turn into our clothes lost in the bed sheets
I might have to wife you, so nobody accept me
Guess what you've given to me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
This electric love's like a Tesla (Oh)
Fall in love every time we sex

Huffman don't take no nonsense
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle
And the red man's fire in his eye

You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
Four kicks who's strutting now?

This party is overrated
But there ain't shit else to do
She's a lovin' on a boy from the city
I'll be lovin' him under my shoe

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Tell me you love me
Tell me you want me, tell me there's nobody else that's above me
Tell me you need me, give me the reason, it's not because you love me
'Cause I don't even know if I love myself
So I don't know if I'll love someone else
Can't fight the feeling, but I still feel it somewhere close
And I might be tripping, but I don't think so, but I don't know
Yeah, I can feel it, a million miles away, don't you know
I'm falling deeper into the-

[Intro]
I just, I just dream
Dream, dream
I just, I just dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

[Verse 1]
I won't crash your car (What?) if you don’t crash mine
And I only feel better half of the time
When I am sleepin' and I'm dreamin’ in my bed
And I don't know if I'm awake or I'm dead

[Pre-Chorus]
I always remember that you love me
When I leave my lonely body
I always remember that you need me
When I'm nodding off slowly

[Chorus]
So I just, I just dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
That it isn't how it seems
Seems, seems, seems
Yeah, we'll be caught up in between
'Tween, ’tween, ’tween, 'tween
And it’s only you and me
For the evening

[Verse 2]
I slept for three days, officially
Got no idea what you said to me
I go to sleep so you'll be next to me
I'm not lazy, no
She hit me like that, you know it's good for me
She got me running back and accidentally
Wrote a symphony, when you spoke
I always knew you could go off

[Pre-Chorus]
I always remember that you love me
When I leave my lonely body
I always remember that you need me
When I’m nodding off slowly

[Chorus]
So I just, I just dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
That it isn't how it seems
Seems, seems, seems
Yeah, we'll be caught up in between
'Tween, 'tween, 'tween, 'tween
And it's only you and me
For the evening

[Outro]
I always remember that you love me
When I leave my lonely body
I always remember that you need me
When I'm nodding off slowly

[Intro: Jeshi]
Yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh
Uh, yeah (Please, be safe)
Yeah, oh (Got an ID on the ind—)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jeshi, Connor O'Malley & Joe Pera]
Concrete streets I stroll
My trainers drag, head hangin' low
Clothes hang off limbs, body wearin' then
Fire burnin', thick smoke is wadin' in
Can't even breathe, places that I'm in
Expensive lies out them Veuve sips
Goin' through ego flares and trips (Trips)
That's when you got disappear and dip
Hide under hills, don't remember thе last time (Yeah)
Probably on a mad one, undеr pills
Time standin' still, I see bodies dance
Body trance, tryna be the man still
I'm drivin' 'round and gettin' fucked up
Tryna be the man still, man still
I'm tryna be the man still (Still)
And I got my gun in the car
Tryna be the man still, hey
I'll keep that in mind

[Chorus: Jeshi]
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
And I don't know where I'm goin' to
I wouldn't have it any other way
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
And I don't know where I'm goin' to
I wouldn't have it any other way

[Verse 2: Jeshi]
He brings us for the vibe
Hide under blue tones
On the sofa, my shirt and my shoes on
Tryna find somethin' I can prove wrong
American spirit and Moon rocks
Naked bodies on futons
Scent of fire in the air
And I stroll through bliss, feel so unaware
Fireworks paintin' the air, so crazy
Just blew through another year
Same hoodie hidin' my face (My face)
Revenge same old better taste (Taste)
Same bitter look on your face (Your face)
It don't change (Wait)
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait

[Outro: Jeshi & Connor O'Malley]
This is sad, man
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
I see you sometimes, wish we could wait
And I wake up, and you know what?
I'm the president of the world
Just—, yeah

[Intro]
We left highschool, my friend and I put on our backpacks, all our packing gear, and we're going up to the mountains. I stayed 'cause it was like something, it was everything that, that I have actually left behind all rolled into one. You know what I mean? Comprende? A collective unit that, that it turns me on, made my sensitive, you know?
All rolled into one

[Interlude]
If you could pick up your stuff, and you were lucky if you had a truck or something
Bye, bye

[Chorus]
So, run away with me (Ok)
I'll promise I'll be good (Lemme get that for you)
I know I'm gutterly
Still running from the woods
And promise you'll be sweet (Yeah)
You told me that you would (Oh, lord)
So, run away with me (Oh, lord)
I promise I'll be good

[Verse]
Wish I could see it all the way
Seen myself in all the shades I wear
(Yeah, yeah, look, aye, look, ok)
Once again, I'm lost again
Still I, can wait for heaven's bliss

[Chorus]
So, run away with me
I'll promise I'll be good
I know I'm gutterly
Still running from the woods
Promise you'll be sweet
You told me that you would
So, run away with me
I promise I'll be good, good

[Chorus]
Waistline
Don’t you let it go
Wanna say you like
When I grind up on you like
Put it in rotation
Grinding on you like this
Grinding on you like this
If I keep grinding on you like this
I might just bring you back to my crib

[Verse 1]
When you grab my waist
Even in the dark, I could see your face
When you lick your lips, don't pull apart
Baby, don’t you start
Got me on the floor
Bout to leave this club
You can tell my friends I’ll be at your door
Yeah, can I dance on you (Yuh)
Baby do you mind if I dance on you
No pants on you
In that tight skirt
Slow it down, working, that side work
If I don’t get your number that might hurt
Ass cheeks under that white shirt, uh
Spend the night, night
Then the day, day on the dick
Twerk, twerk in the day, day on the dick
Rotate, spinnin' like a bay blade on the dick
Cuckoo for the cocoa puffs, grinding on the dick
Sitting on your lap with your face on the psh-
Champagne on my brain
You can tell I’ve had a sip
Then it’s off to the bartender
Boy you know you got my word
Juicy when I drop that ass
You gon’ have to hold my purse
Baby can I calm them nerves
I don’t care I saw you first
You ain’t gotta dance all up on them girls
They ain't got curves, I ain't like hers
Dance for the club one time, no words
Make it rotate when I grab that tongue
Wrist on cold with a ass on "brrrr"
Dance on that nigga like the end of the world, mhm

[Chorus]
Waistline
Don’t you let it go
Wanna say you like
When I grind up on you like
Put it in rotation

Grinding on you like this
If I keep grinding on you like this
Might just bring you back to my crib
Yeah, grinding on you like this
(Like this)
Grinding on you like this
If I keep grinding on you like this
I might just bring you back to my crib
Grinding on you like this
(Like this)
Grinding on you like this
If I keep grinding on you like this
I might just bring you back to my crib, uh

[Verse 2]
Baby drip, drippin down my body, god
Girls comin' out like mardi gras
Hurts when you grab them naughty parts
Shoulda brought with me some gnarly force
Cause I’m all in my heels
You all in your feels
The party feel dead
We probably gon’ dip
We uber wrong way
And you ain’t got wheels
We both just pop pills
If you ain't got plans
If you ain't got hoes and I got no mans
So here's to find in, let’s skip the whole dance
We ain’t gotta rush this sacred time
Like a hourglass, grab that waistline

[Chorus]
Waistline
Don’t you let it go
Wanna say you like
When I grind up on you like
If I keep grinding on you like this
Might just bring you back to my crib
Yeah, grinding on you like this
(Like this)
Grinding on you like this
If I keep grinding on you like this
I might just bring you back to my crib
Grinding on you like this
(Like this)
Grinding on you like this
If I keep grinding on you like this
I might just bring you back to my crib, uh

If you get down and you quarrel everyday
You are saying prayers to the devils, I say, wo-oh-ooh!
Why not help one another on the way?
Make it much easier, just a little bit easier

[Verse 2]
Say you just could not live a negative way
And you know what I mean
Make way for the positive day
'Cause it's a new day
New time
And it's a new feeling
And it's a new Zion
Oh, what a new day

After all, I did all these things for you
For you, it's all for you

Toxic and not healthy
But I'm good now and I will be
And it's fucked up, you help me
Yeah, you do, yeah, you do, you do, you do

But you're bad for me

Every time, every time you tell me you gon' change

If you look in my eyes, you gotta know it's true
Told me a million lies but I still try to make due
Baby, I gave you time and always more
Baby, you got what you want and now I'm paying for it
Oh, you're supposed to love, with a love that's official
Talking all that shit gonna make me fuck around and go missing, oh
And don't try to make up cause I'm fine
Cause you're a stranger in my eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stranger in my eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I’ve got a little dog, biting at my heels

I'm not gonna heal you, not gonna make your dreams come true
Don't touch me, don't even look at me
I've got laser beams coming out my eyes
Do you still really, wanna mess with me?
Wanna mess with me? Wanna mess with me?

I got tough 'cause I had enough
I was a girl with a big heart and they really roughed me up
My body fell asleep when they took it away from me
But I got it back, now I do what I like with it
Do what I like with it, do what I like with it, yeah

Show me your soft spot, have some pillow talk
Your sweat tastes salty, your brakes are faulty
Watch the sky, don't feel shame
Talking back, don't feel shame
Saying no, saying no, saying no
Dressed up, letting go, letting go
Dirty mouth, don’t feel shame
Stepping out of the frame

I’m gon’ wait
Wait for you
Wait for me too
‘Cause I’m all the way, and I’m in town
Waitin’ for you
Waitin’ for you

[Verse 1 : Lil Yachty, B-Lou, ZIAS!]
Ooh, hold on
Nigga, Glock on a toaster
That mean the Glock got a magazine
Nigga put a hole in a nigga
Sum like a Krispy Kreme, donut
And we 'bout to get coins
Out in Vegas on the strip
Out in Vegas on the strip
Nigga talkin' real down, punch a nigga in his lip
At my aunt's, keep clips
Extra, fully auto
Know I just fucked on a model
Know that we poppin' them bottles
If she don't fuck she gettin' kicked out, she know the motto
She gotta swallow

[Verse 2 : Lil Yachty, B-Lou, ZIAS!]
In my white tee
Hunnid thousand dollar chain on me
It's why they don't like me
Niggas know my name and they know where I be
If they got a problem, want some smoke
They can see mе
It's Big Boat in the VIP
Pulled up like 50 deep
Niggas know I - how I'm comin', how I'm bummin'
AR with a scopе
Hit his arm and his nose
Give a fuck, we takin' hoes
Yeah we takin' bitches
Nigga talkin' down we put 'em in the ditches
Fuck yo' bitch make her do the dishes
We ain't kill 'em but we left 'em with a couple stitches
And we sendin' blitzes
Nigga, B-Lou pull up and I'll fuck yo' mistress
You see this chain? he got a lot of riches

[Verse 3 : Lil Yachty, B-Lou, ZIAS!]
We'll break a bitch back
Break a bitch back
All my niggas come attack
I don't wanna comment no more, so I'll let the bitches stack
My shootas pull up in all black
My chain cost a couple racks
I ain't got one on right now but you do
That's stacks
Nigga, I grind so hard I deserve me a plaque

[Verse 4 : Lil Yachty, B-Lou]
We ain't come to play, you niggas finna lay
Man, these niggas actin' gay
Pull up with a hunnid, it's gon' spray
We'll push his wig back, Arrogant Tae
I just stack my chips, Frito Lay
We'll leave 'em where he stay
Shit, it's a dirty game
Oh, his chain was colorful? we made it gray
My diamonds water like the rain
My diamonds drippin' like the sink
That nigga, is a stain
That nigga, is a lame

[Verse 5 : Lil Yachty, B-Lou, ZIAS!]
Come this way, we don't play that
We don't play that, we don't play that
Shoutout Lil Yachty
Me and B-Lou, we go way back
My shooters they gon' spray that
We gon' push his fuckin' wave cap, back
Back, back, back
Push his shit back
I will not fall again
I will not Fall again
Oh No, no

Feeling like 007
You’re my night fire
One and only desire
We drift to foreign lands
On missions of love

Feeling like thieves in the night
No villain can vanquish 
Nothing come between us
Forever my Bonnie
And I, your Clyde 

Because your kiss is chaos
My love, your kiss is chaos
I’ll Never fall again into chaos
No, no
Oh, no, no

Blazing through the city
In my Tesla 
Voltage at a highspeed
Like a rollercoaster 
Tryna get to you
Before the night is done

Ooh you got me feeling like  Marvin
Or maybe Otis
Something in my soul was stirring
For your love
You knew this was the case

Because your kiss is chaos
My love, my love
Your kiss Is chaos

Your kiss is like chaos on my lips
Chaos on my lips
Oh no, no

[from snippet]

[verse ?]
Lesson no no
Simmer simmer simmer simmer down
I’ve been catching catching catching now
Still can’t let it-

[Chorus]

[?] tomorrow if I spend it today
Cause it is what it is and I’m taken
If we see the same stars
You can’t be that far away

If we feel the same things
But very rarely
Do we agree

I say you have a short fuse
You say I let loose
But who really knows the truth

(You  never, never, never really know)

We all have things to say
But maybe the silence is good
We all have things to say
But baby, we’re misunderstood
Sometimes

We all have things to say
But baby the silence is good
We all have things to say
But baby, we’re misunderstood

You know
You never have to hide
Never have to disguise

Don’t keep things away from me
I tell you the way I feel

Though sometimes
We get into it
I’ll never throw the towel in

So maybe thats just me
Maybe Im the crazy one

We all have things to say
But maybe the silence is good
We all have things to say
But baby, we’re misunderstood
Sometimes
We lie, we cheat
We steal, we thrill
We heal with our words

We play, we stay
We go, we stray
It’s all in our words
We know, we grow
We feel we know
All with our words
Sometimes

Cause’ we all have things to say
We all have things to say
I noticed you felt it, too
But when I asked
You denied it
Cool (cool)

Kiss the back of your hand
Then you played the fool
But what was I supposed to do?

You said I came across you rude
I just said what you wanted me to

Now its my fault
Lose control
Lose control
Lose control
Lose control
Lose control


Don’t bite the hand that feeds you
All the love I give to you
Why we argue, never know
Sometimes we just lose control
Wanted your love years ago
Pressed against some great unknown

Now its my fault
Lose control
Lose control
Losе control
Lose control
Lose control
Lose control
Whats my line again?
You already know it
This love is young

You don't have to be with me
I don’t remember asking
If you want to go, you're free

Could see a love some way
Easy as a summer's day
5am
I’m still awake for you

Could you see me and you
Outer space in the afternoon?
5am
Im still awake for you

What's the point in this
If we can't be happy?
Are you positive?

You don't have to be with me
I don't remember asking
If you want to go, you're free

Could see a love some way
Easy as a summer's day
5am
I'm still awake for you

Could you see me and you
Outer space in the afternoon
5am
Im still awake for you

Statе your purpose
You seem nervous
Does your hеart lift
When I kiss you?

Does your mind drift
When I’m with you?
5am, no I can’t sleep
I'm thinking ‘bout you

Could see a love some way
Easy as a summer’s day
5am
I'm still awake for you
Could you see me and you
Outer space in the afternoon
5am
Im still awake for you

Could see a love some way
Easy as a summer's day
5am I'm still awake for you

Could you see me and you
Outer space in the afternoon
5am
Im still awake for you
Shy on the onset
Smooth with the words
She gave him stories
Didn’t even have to ask for it

Parisian pale dusk
Tokyo dawns
They promised each other
Each other the world

Something in back of his mind
Said take time
Don’t rush where you can’t see ahead
But he didn’t listen
Heart wrapped up in kisses
Feeling like the right thing
Right thing

But if it ain’t broke
Then why you tryna fix it?
If it ain’t broke
Then why you tryna fix it?
‘Cause if it ain’t broke
Then leave it alone

She made vow
Gave him her heart
He broke it
Broke it into pieces

All the kings horses
And all the kings men
Couldn’t put her back together again

Picked up the pieces herself
Didn’t need no one
To make it better
But now he’s coming back around
Think she’s down for the thrill
But she prefer to heal now
Heal now

So if it ain’t broke
Then why you tryna fix it?
If it ain’t broke
Then why you keep tryna repair it
Cause if it ain’t broke
Then leave it alone
Like seasons
People come
You gotta let ‘em go
Don’t you hold yourself down
Let ‘em go

If people don’t believe in you
Let em go
Ain’t doing you no favors
So let ‘em go

Everything is changing
Let it go
Don’t you be afraid of change
Just let it go
Keep yourself focused
And let it go

Don’t get caught up
Baby let it go
Let it go
Just let it go

Ohhh, Ohhh

Somethings in the air, chief
Big moves going down
In these city streets
The youth just want to go out
And have fun
The feds look to body someone

When these worlds collide
Who know what happens in the wake
Just like a kaleidoscope
But I cannot see the shape

Night moves

Ohhh, Oohh

Nights like this
I find
I just want your body close to mine
I try to think
Of nothing from the day
Just your fingertips
Rolling up and down my spine

But sometimes
When I’m with you
My mind still wanders away

But I just wanna move with you
And dance the night away

Night moves

Wake up

Wake up
Before it’s too late

You sleep all the time
Do you remember
What the sun looks like

Or have you forgotten the light
That shines upon your face?

You keep your eyes closed
In the dead of day
Oh, I wish you could see
The smile upon my face

So wake up
So Wake up
So wake up
Before it’s too late
So Wake up
So Wake up
So Wake up
Before it’s too late

Before it’s too late

Beforе it’s too late

All you do is sleep
All the time
All you do is sleep
All the time

When you gonna wake up?

All you do is sleep
All you do is sleep
All you do is sleep
All the time

When you gonna wake up?
I know you’re trying to change your ways
I know you’re often filled with rage
But why is it like a battle
When I’m trying to help you?

You say you want to heal and grow
But act so selfish and entitled
Your actions speak much louder than your words

Oh why can’t you see it?
Why? (Oh no)


You’re becoming so successful
You’re becoming so successful
But famous friends and money
Won’t heal your soul
Oh no

You’re getting everything you want
You’re getting everything you want
But what good is it at all
If there’s no one around
Who loves and cares for you?
Oh why can’t you see it?
Why?
Can’t you see it?
Why?
Can’t you see it?
Oh Why?

I know you’re trying to change your ways
I know you’re trying to change your ways
I know you’re trying to change your ways
I know you’re trying to change your ways

Baby, you’re trying to change your ways
You’re ways

[Verse 1]
Every night I prayed for, prayed for clarity
All while you were lying right there next to me
You barely even noticed I was losing sleep
You barely even noticed you were losing me, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say shit to me
Don't say a word to me
Don't ask me to change
Don't want your heart to break
Words don't hurt no more
I heard it all before
Don't ask me to change
Don't want your heart to break

[Chorus]
Don't want your heart to break
Don't want your heart to break
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't doin' retrograde
Ain't doin' retrogradе
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't goin' backwards now

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't doin' retrograde

[Verse 2]
Is it just that you're so damn oblivious?
Or is it just that you don't takе me serious? (Mmm)
Counting my excuses more than millions (Oh)
Boy, I'm done with it, done with it, done with it
I don't even know what I'm doing here

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say shit to me
Don't say a word to me
Don't ask me to change
Don't want your heart to break
Words don't hurt no more
I heard it all before
Don't ask me to change (Oh)
Don't want your heart to break (Oh)

[Chorus]
Don't want your heart to break
Don't want your heart to break
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't doin' retrograde
Ain't doin' retrograde
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't goin' backwards now

[Outro]
Ain't doin' retrograde
Ain't goin' backwards now
Ain't doin' retrograde
Al Green:

[Verse 1]
I was tired of being alone
And then someone came along
Something made me feel so strong
About you
Baby, can this be
Someone that's so lovely
Could love someone like me
Is it true?

Playa:

[Chorus]
Could this be the love
The love for me?
Oh, my dreams come true, baby
True love indeed
The love I need
Could this be the love?

Al Green & (Playa): 

[Verse 2]
There's something deep inside
No longer I couldn't hide
What I feel for you has got to be right, (so right, so right)
Now I know I've changed
And I know that it's a shame
I act every time I hear your name
Playa:

[Chorus]
Could this be the love
The love for me?
True love indeed
The love I need
Could this be the love?

[Verse]
She ain't wanna fuck with me, she told me I was dusty
50 Xanax bars when I pulled up in a Jet-ski
Now that I got money, now I know that this shit must be
Playing with your mind while you fuck me and suck me

I done 

[?] it to make it musty
If I do a crime ain't no 

[?] trusty
I got my group all in my party, shawty if you try me, I'm busting
I took my love away from my shawty, don't trust me
And she one fuck away from getting thrown out the function
M.I.A. with niggas, gotta fuck up the function
M.I.A. with niggas, wanna fuck up the function
Only got my fuckin' heart broke 'cause I loved her
Wish I treated this bitch like a hoe, I should've dubbеd her
Knew she was a thot, out thе spot, but I cuffed her
YSL the drip like I was Thugger, I'm balled out
Uh, you wasn't fucking with me back when I was dusty
But you can suck my dick for every time I succeed
Off the white, got the ice like I'm Gretzky
'Cause I regret you and you cannot regret me

[Verse]
Only a year, but I won't let you put it past
I was young at the devils, cooking crack
Funny how I ended on top 'cause, I remember times they will always put me last
I ain't talking X.O but I get cash
I'm driving new Ferrari, pray I don't crash
Used to make fun of me, now I'm the one to laugh
'Cause you broke, I know you mad
I got to the money bag

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, I know, thеy pray on my downfall
I know, I know you mad off without you
I know, I know you see what is real now
I really want...

[Verse]
I'm the world's best dancer
You might've seen me on the television
I got these moves you couldn't make up
Not even in your own imagination
I'm the world's best dancer
But my talents keep me isolated
I'm on the verge of something bigger
Don't know why you aren't infatuated, oh

[Chorus]
Dancing is the answer
Follow, I'm the master
Dancing is the answer
Follow, I'm the master
'Cause I'm the world's best dancer
Yeah, I'm the world's best dancеr

[Verse 1]
Uh
Since a youngin I've been hustling for a chance, yeah
Mumma caught me thuggin up to that mansion
I was sitting water whippin giving glances
Mumma told me this a way to get up out that lancer
Dad was given heir court orders and addresses
I've been on the real thinking back to what had happened
I'm not tryna feel how I did way back then
It's whatever, it happened, now back to rapping
Yuh

[Chorus]
Way back
Way back out to my past
Way back
Way back out to my heart
Way back right to the start of it all, yeah
Back when I was young
All ready to move from it all

[Verse 2]
Look, where's the lord, when you need him here the most?
That's how I thought, 'cause, every day I would pray to god
He came in short, at least, at the time, that's how I saw it
Til' blessings came in and lessons was all that he taught
I used to debate my faith for selfishness and my mistake
But what else was I to say when nothing else was going on?
My uncle passes 15, killers buried him at 16
Felt like I was in Schitt's Creek, started creating songs

[Pre Chorus]
I
I, I don't know which way to go
I think I'm gonna lose control
Somewhere tell me where to go

[Chorus]
Way back
Way back out to my past
Way back
Way back out to my heart
Way back right to the start of it all, yeah
Back when I was young
All ready to move from it all, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Dah dah dah dah daddah
Dah, dah dah dah dah daddah
Daddah, dah
Daddah, dah
Yeah, one time

Yeah, shout out to my family members
Shout out to everyone

Myspace.com/ISmellPanties, yeah
Come guess me this riddle, what beats pipe and fiddle
What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
Sweeter than honey and stronger than steam

What can make the dumb talk, what can make the lame walk
What's the elixir of life and philosopher's stone
And what helped Mr. Brunnell to dig the Thames Tunnel
Sure wasn't it whiskey from old Inis Eoghain

So we'll stick to the cratur the best thing in nature
For sinkin' your sorrows and raisin' your joys
And boys I half wondеr if lighting and thunder
Was made from the plundеr of whiskey me boys

[Intro]
Ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Refrain]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows

[Chorus]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy

Man, how many times have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

[Chorus]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?

[Intro]
I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we were first met, girl?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in lovе?
We were young and innocеnt then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember back in the Fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare

[Chorus]
Tell me, do you remember the time when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we were first met, girl?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we were first met, girl?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you, so I'll never let you go"
Do you remember back in the Spring?
Every morning, the birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we were first met, girl?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we were first met, girl?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 3]
Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what we said
I will never forget what we did, now baby!

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time, (Do you remember?) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we were first met, girl?
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby!)
Do you remember the time, ('Cause I remember) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time, (Oh, I) when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby!)
Remember the time? (Hoo!)
Remember the time?

[Bridge]
Do you remember, girl? (Remember the time?)
On the phone, you and me? (Remember the time?)
'Til dawn, 2 or 3, what about us, girl? (Remember the time?)
Do ya', do ya', do ya', do ya', do ya'? (Remember the time?)
In the bar, on the beach? (Remember the time?) you and me in Spain
What about, what about? (Remember the time?)

[Outro]
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

You like me so much when I'm like this
You like me 'cause I'm such a bad bitch
And I can tell that you just wanna kiss
And I can tell that you just wanna make up

[Pre-Chorus]
What are we fighting for?
Bet you can't remember
We've been here before

Makes you want me more

We could change the weather baby, talking me and you
Hop up in that G4, and let you see my point of view
You know I love your attitude, and though you do not understand it
Baby you a superstar, you should be named after a planet, dammnit
Woah, woah, woah, woah, sip that air like, woah, woah
If you didn’t know, y’all must’ve been dozing since she, she’s loco, oh-oh
And he’s a fool if he dont tell you you’re the finest
He just don’t know what we found and where we find it, oh whoa
She’s searching for better love, look around
Lead us to those clouds
She said it was complicated
But the man shе don’t want, is the man she’s with now, whoa
It’s like it startеd up with you, said I’m in love
Yeah when it’s stormy and you don’t feel protected
You just want what you deserve but you get the lesson, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
It don’t matter rain or snowing
Girl let’s pack your bag, let’s just hit the road
Is there anywhere you wanna go?
Yeah it’s a chance of a lifetime
Baby, don’t you tell me no

[Chorus]
We could change the weather baby, whoa
We could change the weather baby, me and you
Girl us two, what to do
Just a chance, we got nothing to lose
I could be the sun to your rain
Be the chill to your pain, oh-oh
We could change the weather baby, whoa
We could change the weather baby, whoa

[Music Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
It don’t matter rain or snowing
Girl let’s pack your bag, let’s just hit the road
Is there anywhere you wanna go?
Yeah it’s a chance of a lifetime
Baby, don’t you tell me no

[Chorus]
We could change the weather baby, whoa
We could change the weather baby, me and you
Girl us two, what to do
Just a chance, we got nothing to lose
I could be the sun to your rain
Be the chill to your pain, oh-oh

We could change the weather baby, whoa

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eh
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Wake up, wake up, tell me how you feelin'
You've been layin' in your bed through the day
Stare at the ceilin' 'til the sky fall, lookin' up at fly balls
Worry you ain't livin' right
Fuckin' with a bitch you know you didn't like
I'm the business type, money stacks, pigeon height
Came up wearin' hand-me-downs, clothes that wasn't fittin' right
Gettin' loose, sittin' tight
100 proof addict wit' a bubble-goose jacket, damn straight we gettin' lit tonight
Bigger dog, bigger bite, business class ticket flights
Baby, I can treat you right, tell mе what it is you like
Real pimp, I ain't playin' like a bitch
Oncе you make a little money, trust me, everybody switch it

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
Let me know, 'cause today always different than tomorrow
Baby, anything goes, goes, goes (Yeah)
Does it get too heavy?
Let it flow, 'cause ain't nobody got the time for sorrow
Baby, anything goes, goes, goes

[Verse 2]
Yep
Well, I must've left my mind at the crib when I went out
I never had the time to be normal, why begin now?
Life full of sin, that's the crazy world we livin' in
Blew it on a poker game, finally gettin' rich again
Damn straight, everything I'm rockin', shit is hand-made
Got the people jumpin' for a rum and make the land shake
Get home from work, I'm in the man-cave
Watchin' Fargo, the phone chargin' by the lampshade
Yeah, what you talkin' 'bout if you ain't sayin' nothin'?
Quit your trippin', keep the bad bitches comin'
I'm at the function, I done came up out the dungeon
Now I'm goin' through the trees like Paul Bunyan
Come and fuck with me
Bitches round the world fall in love with me
But once they get to know me then they done with me
'Cause I'm a headcase
One thing let's get straight: You ain't fuckin' with me on your best day, ayy

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
Let me know, 'cause today always different than tomorrow
Baby, anything goes, goes, goes (Yeah)
Does it get too heavy?
Let it flow, 'cause ain't nobody got the time for sorrow
Baby, anything goes, goes, goes

[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
(Hurry, I'm worried)

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you'rе gonna die, not by mistake

[Chorus]
So, wherе did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
Bounce with me everybody, come on

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
(Hurry, I'm worried)

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
Sick of listenin' to everyone else (Oh-ooh)
Sick of my pride (Ooh)
Sick of just saying shit just to be nice
Sick of this world, how do I get by?
Mind runnin' wild in my head (runnin' wild)
Pacing going back instead of movin' forward
Time is moving forward (Yeah, yeah)
Mind runnin' wild in my head (runnin' wild)
I'm just scared of moving forward

*Today my brother seen lil  yachty in traffic and he posted this after*

[Verse 1]
Ok see this is what kills me, right, so say, to get your car tinted, you would have to, uh, go in court and explain why, it should be tinted, this would be a perfect enough reason for me making my windows tinted, like if it had to go to court and have a evidence of why, because like as a celebrity you cannot expect, or as, as, someone who isn't a celebrity, you cannot expect all celebrities just be havin' a good day all the time, and it's crazy and lеmme tell you why, becausе these people, when they drove, they went on the side of me I saw them already, I spoke to them already, so it's like, if you, bro, I see you right here and then I speak to you and you go past me and you record it's like you want me to keep being like *shaky yachty* euch, euuuch, how many times yall say hey, do you say hey to your friends two or three times, after you just met, you say hey, that's it, you don't keep doing it

[Verse 1]
You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you tore off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Littlе house little kids little small town story
If you don't еver do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy

[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy

[Bridge]
Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind
I wish you'd come on back and make it all right
Before they're called...home, boy

[Verse]
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answеr, you're home
Hold on, if love is thе answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
I'll be the one to show you the way
You'll be the one to always complain
3 in the morning come a bang, bang, bang
All out of fags and I just can't wait

Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two

18, balding, star
Golden fallen heart

Look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyone's gathered to idolize me
I hate the way you talk your Japanese scream

It's been too long since I left thе shed
You kick the bucket and I'll swing my lеgs
Always remember the pact that we made
Too young to die but old is the grave
18, balding, star
Golden fallen heart

I'm a going to show the way
I'm a going to show the way
I'm a going to show the way
I'm a going to show the way

18, balding, star
I used to see you every day
Used to see you every day
I danced around your folk and soul
I danced to all your fucking soul

I left you with your nose a bleedin'
And your toes creepin' around
Ah, so mundane and incomplete
Hand me down my pants and get me off this street

I'm passed out in your graden
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party but I'm soft

Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat like eyes
And in your nose blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes
You let you perfect nipple show

[Verse 1]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, and beat him over the head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
Forget an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
We blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of Holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers?
We blowin' up your housе, killin' your parents
Comin' back to get your foster mamas
And I'm as good at keepin' your promisе as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam War Vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more, 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al. B Sure!

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn: I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two-by-four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an A Capella
To chop a fella' to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar, with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia, while I'm standin' next to ya'
Eatin' a four-course meal, watchin' you starve to death
With an IV in your vein, feedin' you liquid Darvocet
Pumpin' you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gun shop victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven to recievin'
With the asses ripped outta they' pants
And given a less than a 20% chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you, while you scream: "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pullin' your Adam's Apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpet, and burn up your entire apartment

[Verse 1]
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone every Friday night
You make me feel like home, so I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you, honey

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So
Chose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Verse 2]
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So
Chose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insa-a-a-ane

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

A-a-a-ah
A-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah

Take a walk on the wild side
Take a walk on the wild side

Nobody where I'm from did it like this

There ain't too many like me
I'm high as fuck off the weed
Won't catch me doin' no hype shit
I'm more determined than a Hypebeast
Bitch, I'm rich, that's high-key
I'm sittin' in the back of the bach thinkin' how it happened
God must've worked his magic, I just got rich off rappin'
They tell me they love me daily, I know they all just cappin'
Like where the fuck was y'all when I was down and didn't have shit?
And fuck thesе hoes, I do them all the samе way, but all the same
I'm still stuck up on the same way, I cannot change

[?] same day, I make it back, whatever
I been this way for my whole life, I be this way forever

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I'm still thuggin' with the gang, niggas tryna maintain

[Intro]
Yup, send my big brother to go do a stick up
Whip got the hiccups, hydraulics, my feet up
Old bitch keep callin’, she think I’m gon’ pickup
Made the bitch ride me, she couldn’t keep my dick up
Single…
(CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY)
Hey, hey, hey (Go get em’)

[Verse]
Send my big brother to go do a stick up
Whip got the hiccups, hydraulics, my feet up
Old bitch keep callin’, she think I’m gon’ pickup
Made the bitch ride me, she couldn’t keep my dick up
Single reporter, yo’ bitch for a pickup
Send a cool dub and she made a new friend
And she brought to the den
Broke her back in, her friend made my bitch lick her friend
Made her cum like it’s past tense
Buddy rape, that’s super lame, he a has been
Might just stop rappin’ and start doin’ castins’
Look like a lick, all this ice, I’m Alaskan
Yes I’m the Boat, may I ask, who is askin’?
Pullin’ yo’ flag, I’m the flag team captain
Stop all that cappin’, you regal action (Fuck)
Single swagin’, bitch I’m always packin’ (Woo)
With the action if it’s really action (Yeah)
Main attraction, got a spinal fraction
Take it to the hood, where them boys taxin’ (They do)
Fuck a bitch cause they always naggin’
If I let her in, she’ll prolly catch me lackin’
Ridin’ round’ five deep in a Hellcat, nigga
Feelin’ like the Jackson’s
Fuck on my bitch, messin’ up her mascara
Slurp on this dick, for that new Panamera
Nigga got bread, havin’ bread like Panera
My bitch Tierra, she work at Tiara
Makin these M’s, shoutout to my PR
When I get bored, I might go buy a car
I can’t buy a drink, but I could buy the bar
I can’t go to clubs but them niggas still pay me (Aye)
Hole livera, these ain’t 

[?] like Jay Z
Coupe wrapped in yellow, it look like a daisy
Posted in Texas, I should be with Sanchez
Neck gon’ fishin’ and my jewelry box very breezy (Woo)
Did a lil feature and went bought AP’s
Drum on the kit, with the lights, she like KG
Fuckin’ these fuck niggas up, just like Tay Keith
Came with the heat, someone must’ broke the AC
Been gettin money since’ B.C. and A.D
Young nigga make that lil bitch eat them babies (Yup)
Spit out the nut, that shit look just like rabies (Ugh)
I owe that bitch a Mercedes
Ride on the beat like a mufuckin’ horse
Drive the Hellcat down the street like a course
Don’t believe shit unless it come from the source
Fuckin two bitches, I make them hoes morf
Last line, should prolly rhyme something with dorf
Fuck it, I might go buy her six bags
Can’t check my luggage, these Louie V bags
Came from 06', fuck up my wrist
Diamonds they dance, like a teenage, Chris Brown
Fuck that lil bitch in the town
Tip on the Glock, this shit don’t make a sound (Pew, pew)
Talk how I wanna, I made up a noun
Free my big dog out the pound (Huh)
Fuck that lil bitch out her night gown

[Outro]
Pussy, okay, stupid

[Verse 1]
Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape

[Verse 2]
City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
I was raised in the country, been workin’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

[Verse 3]
Ain't got nothing' for you, I had nothing' before
Don’t evеn have anything for myself anymore
Sky's full of firе and the pain's pourin’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around

[Verse 4]
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
They'll never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing that I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 5]
Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s kicking' in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking’ about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleepin' in Rosie’s bed

[Verse 6]
I was walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too

[Verse 7]
Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew ya, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind

[Verse 8]
I got here followin' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 9]
Well my ship’s been split to splinters, it’s sinkin' fast
I’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for all them who’ve sailed with me

[Verse 10]
Everybody movin' if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, anyhow
Things should start to get interestin' right about now

[Verse 11]
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I've painted myself in
I know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine

[Verse 12]
The emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You look so different to me
It's like you barely even, listen

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
You look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' for me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like Field Mob song, Trill Mob boy
She been MIA far too long, so far
Now catch the compensation
Change the conversation, dollars all I'm chasin'
Ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
I'm non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa, Ryan Beatty, JOBA & Shawn Mendes]
It'll be okay, no matter what thеy say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll bе okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me

[Verse 2: SoGone SoFlexy]
Let's not fake the funk
She say I pour too much in my cup
Fuck the opposition, plus I'm still ridin' with it tucked
They say I should change the way I'm livin'
But just can't get enough
Still be quick to up that chopper on his block and hit him up
My little brothers don't come home 'til November
I told 'em we gon' live it up
Can't do shit but pray for J Ron 'cause that nigga don't give a fuck
Not at all, nigga
Had my back against the wall, nigga
Momma told me I'd see it all, nigga

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Yeah, who love you at your lowest of lows?
I know, I mean
I'm in the backyard thinkin' I need
That smoke puffing outta my teeth
I'm good, I got my green
Sittin' back, sippin', ocean breeze
I don't got it baby, ask them boys
All that hating turn to white noise
Tryna get red carpet fly
I don't flex my life, I don't lie
Treat life like I might die
Don't like myself sometimes
But I bet that come with time
Ever feel like your head got screws a little bit loose?
Goddamn, give a fuck if I lose
Ain't no fool, he got déjà vu
I'm the man, I'm the dog, got juice
Just know I fucked up, too
Talk like you got it figured it out
And I wish I did too

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa, Ryan Beatty, JOBA & Shawn Mendes]
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money
You can count on me

[Outro: Jabari Manwa]
Count on me
Count on me

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (Oh, oh)
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

[Pre-Chorus]
When I put on a show, a show, a show, a show
A show, a show, a show, a show

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there (There)
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot

[Pre-Chorus]
When I put on a show, a show, a show, a show
A show, a show, a show, a show

[Chorus]
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip

Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
The same, the same, the same
The same, the same, the same, the same
The same, the same, the same, the same
Let's go

[Chorus]
Like a circus

All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

[Outro]
Let me see what you can do

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
This from the heart, I said, I'm on top, on top
Yeah
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I’m not sober

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
They tryna bring me down, gotta stay focused
When I get sad, I get the Hennessy and pour up
Fuck dirty Sprite, I get the liquor and the cola
And fuck my ex bitch, she did me dirty, I got no trust
I was only young, but I learned that these hoes ain't shit
I gave you my all, and this the thanks I get?
I still can’t believe all of the things I did
I still can't believe that you would leave like this
Traumatized from the shit I've seen in my life
Everything you see right now is the highlight
And no matter how hard I try
Memories still living deep in my mind
I've seen my best friends change colors like a tie-dye
But shout out to the ones that still with me, those are my guys
And fuck everybody else that's just talking from the sidelines
Seeing it and living it, bitch, there is a fine line
And R.I.P. my brother, never got to say bye-bye
It gets hard, I know, believe it
I hope you find the help you're seeking
I was down in Hell, believe me
Packed up my bags and told the Devil, "I'm leaving"

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I’m not sober

[Verse 2: Polo G]
Okay, hold up, I can’t fold up
Be so sick, you lose a soldier, wanna throw up
I kept seein' all your pictures every time I scroll up
Now when we see a nigga, get him, quick to let that pole bust
Cali cruisin’ in that i8 with the doors up
Now we winnin', 'member back then, they never chose us
Now them bitches doin' backbends, givin’ throat up
And I keep collectin' backends 'cause they owed us
I was really tryna find a way up in them streets lost
Don't be in my feelings really, I just be in deep thoughts
And it been fuck the opposites, no, we don't do the peace talk
Foenem come through rockin' shit, and that's another beat caught

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Verse 3: Stunna Gambino]
I get lost up in my feelings in this Wraith, so I just look at the stars
Like, "Goddamn, we done made it this far"
This shit a blessing, nigga
'Cause I remember we was broke, they weren't messin' with us
I had to make my own way, I manifested, nigga
I dropped two-fifty on a Urus, ain't no Tesla, nigga
And it's still fuck the opps, I just don't be addressin' niggas
The feds screamin' out indictments, they collectin' niggas, mmm
Left me heartless, but I'm glad that it's over
No more cryin' on my shoulder
Pour up the Hennessy 'cause I hate bein' sober, mmm

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober
Okay, hold up, baby, roll one
Can we light it? Can we smoke one? Can we pour up?
Mix the Hennessy with the cola
I feel better when I'm not sober

[Verse]
Just the other night, I pulled up to your crib
We had a conversation about the way I choose to live
And the hoes I used to fuck
And the wrong...

Way before I was born, man, some time to pay
To my auntie

I crashed before I evеn had one drink
My lowest points werе formed standing at the sink
I gotta hide these tears just like a G
My niggas cannot see me, dawg

[Intro]
Yeah, got too much motherfuckin' downtime

Got too much, got too much, got too much, got too much
Got too much motherfuckin' downtime (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got too much motherfuckin' downtime
I'm hangin' around, lookin' at bitches with my mouth wide (Uh-huh)
Openin' the south-side (Uh-huh)
Runnin', been around the block and back about a thousand times
Still I keep to exercisin', pussy, what I specialize in (Woo)
This head that I'm in (Uh) is motherfuckin' crazy (Crazy)
For seconds of my time, these motherfuckers better pay me (Money)
I dreamt of flyin', lеft my feet and met horizons
They ask me how I'vе been, I tell 'em, "Shit, I'm just surviving'" (Uh-huh)
Goddamn, in God we trust (Trust)
Get to the dollar, if I gotta I'ma pawn my blood, holler (Holler)
I'm goin' off like alarms durin' a home invasion (Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Product appropriation, bring 'em home, load the bases
I'm never sober, wasted like a four-leaf clover nation
Coaster on my dick, bitch, respect my wood (Yep)
Treat her like shit, but she come back because the sex so good
I'm goin' crazy like, tryna put a dress on Suge

[Verse 2]
Got too much downtime (Woah), shit on the planet, givin' you brown skies
So much weed smoke in the air, even the couch high
I been there, I done that, championships, I won that (Yeah)
Came down, called James Brown and brought the funk back (Funk)
They love Mac, rap circles around you, then make you run laps
The game is shit, it made me sick, the flame I spit, my tongue black
Make a hit, then gain a whip, the bitch will get this sacred dick
Illest since I was twenty, four fives, April 5th (Woo)
These motherfuckers softer than some baby shit
I do this rap shit very well, throw a penny, make a wish (Make a wish)
I don't take no shit, homie, I don't take no shit (No)
I'm just tryna spit some raps, live my life and pay my rent (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I always dreamt of a life like this (Like this)
Ain't nothin' quite like my bitch (Like my bitch)
Just free the thoughts that's in your mind (Your mind)
'Cause we ain't doin' shit but killin' time

[Verse 3]
I swear to God these bitches love you when you up (Woo)
Don't got time unless you down, otherwise don't give a fuck (Nah)
I've been all around the world
Girl, you never met nobody like me (Me)
I'ma get her wet, turn her pussy into a stream (Stream)
Right butt-ass naked, rollin' up weed (Weed)
Goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man and that's a fact (That's a fact)
I'ma run this shit forever, took a oath, I made a pact (Woo)
Fuck the bullshit, just relax, where I am is where it's at (Uh-huh)
Lost my motherfuckin' mind and now I'm down to get it back

[Outro]
Yeah (Hey, um)
Yeah (Hey, um)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh
I wish that you could just see that it's only to protect you, no
How many times can somebody want the same pain? (Pain, pain)
When the pressure put on me, then I change things
And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase
We always end up right back in the same place

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
You-u-u-u-u, wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but
You always knew

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

[Post-Chorus: Kaden Stewardson]
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do

[Post-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do

[Verse 1]
It's that teenage feeling, got me staying in bed
There is nothing on my mind but water in my head
It's got me falling for just anyone, at least thinking I did
And it leaves me hanging on like some idiot kid

[Chorus]
But I knew I had it coming
Well I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

[Verse 2]
It's that teenage sickness keeping me up all night
It's got me climbing up the walls just to pick a good fight
I don't want to be so desperate, oh what have I done
Oh but I can't be alone, I'll take anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

[Bridge]
This was a test, this was a test
This was a tеst, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test yеah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

[Chorus]
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

[Outro]
Whoa this was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test

[Verse 1]
You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Cowboys make me cry

[Refrain]
But there's nothin' I can do
I've been lookin' for a girl like you

[Verse 2]
You look at me, you got nothin' left to say
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance and you won't sing
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring

[Refrain]
But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

[Verse 3]
Put on a little Dylan sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great, you asked me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
Shе inherited a million bucks and when shе died, it came to me

[Refrain]
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

[Bridge]
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Cowboys make me cry

[Refrain]
But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
This is the town I'm living in
This is the street I'm walking down
These are the friends I'm visiting
These are the clothes I'm wearing now
This is the house I'm building here
This is the girl I'm marrying
This is the chord I'm strumming now
This is the faith I'm leaning on
This is the child I'm bearing now
This is the love that I've always had
This is the face I make when I'm sad
This is the town I'm living in

[Chorus]
This is the hard drive
This is the ocean
Have you ever felt yourself in motion?
Have you evеr felt yourself in motion?

[Verse 2]
Thesе are the feet I'm standing on
These are the hands that built a world
This is the bed I'm sleeping in
This is the shirt I'm buttoning
This is the pace I'm moving at
This is the tune I'm humming now
This is the road I'm walking down
These are the lips that form my words
This is the stone that I want to turn
These are the people that I love
These are the eyes that look up above
This is the town I'm living in

[Chorus]
This is the hard drive
This is the ocean
Have you ever felt yourself in motion?
Have you ever felt yourself in motion?
Have you ever felt yourself in motion?
Have you ever felt yourself in motion?
Elliot Smith cover

They come here alone and they leave in twos
Except for you and me who just came to use
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me

Why'd you tell me stuff that's so plainly untrue
If you'll be straight with me I'll be straighter with you
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me

I haven't wanted to do anything for a long time
But whatever you got right now would probably suit me fine
If you're all done like you said you'd bе
What are you doing hanging out with me

I haven't wantеd to do anything for a long time
But whatever you're doing now would probably suit me fine
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me
What are you doing hanging out with me

[Part 1]

[Intro: Samples]
"And so—Viktor Vaughn hid from the world—"
"A fascinating story, but it changes nothing."

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Oh, oooh
Nah, dude—change that beat
That's a'ight, but—the other shit—other shit was iller

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Word, word
Yeah, that shit is dope right there

[Verse 1]
A modern day marvel, but terrible—better—horrible
When he grab the mic from son, he crushed up all his metacarpals
He said he ain't mean it—totally by accident
After the show, he didn't follow where y'all taxi went
Will this be available on wax? Ask Max Mill
They on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill
But will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant
And super like 1-A, have a fun stay
One day, he plan to put in a runway
With enough land for his own projects and gun play
Section eight penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway
Alotta y'all ass out like gay runaway
It's how they say "semi-risque"
All day everyday, give out Emmy's the quick way
Have the average MC say, "Gimme a sick day!"
They really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh
Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch
In school, he kept a doo-rag in a bag lunch
Just to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit
He writ this skit in Sanskrit
If the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low
Your man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though
It's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow
Tucked-in Le Tigre—just let the name-buckle show

[Part 3]

[Verse 2]
Good googly moogly—see that loogie?
Yeah—but keep it on the D.L. Hughley
You don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie
Just to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*—Mitsurugi
Gooey gum drops—who he got his style from?
—his pops—you gotta give the bum some props
Ask ya sister—her beat box is more-thicker
DOOM that nigga detox with more liquor

[Part 4]

[Verse 3]
Villain for hire—admire the sound
Make sure the price is right before he come on down!
Rappers be on some "You, you, you!"
Forgot who they talking too, too much pork stew
They need to not come out with nothing new
Blew the whole shit up on some "What this button do?"
DOOM cheat the game like walkthrough
Run 'em, son 'em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo
The way alotta clowns get down is unnatural
This flow flip like oranges, apples
Rhymes is like limes to a Lemonade Snapple
Leave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple
First thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone
Then they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on
In came the Villain with the old gear like, "Hi, there
Y'all play the rear, this whole year my year."
Metal Face beard like Brillo pad
Y'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad
Seed call him, "Ol' dad," the one the ol' ho had
Knew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads
Okay pal, pay him like Paypal
So we could be A-OK not OK Corral
I think today I'll make the ladies say, "Ow"
And maybe fuck around take a bow, now

[Part 5]

[Verse 4]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?

[Outro]
Nah, yo

[Intro: Sade, MF DOOM]
Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take "Means to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

[Chorus: MF DOOM]
On Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown

[Chorus: MF DOOM]
On Doomsday!, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!

[Outro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl & MF Doom]
Doomsday
Check the sound
Right around
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel you MC

[Intro: MF DOOM + sample]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
("Hey!")
I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening
Let me know if y'all with me, y'all
("Hey!")
Just a couple of things I wanna say

[Verse]
I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase:
With more rhymes than there's ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian
He wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor, chillin'
Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that
Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record; this is some shit I just thought of, y'all
Science fiction that's not admissible ("Hey!") in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop—to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listamint
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell—("Hey!")
—tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three
Shots from the black bat got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock
She told me, "Get off," I said, "Bitch!
Let me set this shit off so I can get rich right quick"
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga, come out and rock this nation like ("Hey!") ox defacin'
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin' and it sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens, and more of they friends ("Hey!")
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of Becks to triple X?
He just came in 4-D: Follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh, snap!
It seems you walked into a trap, through rap
Zoinks!
This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move, and get broke off like end of Phillies
True believers
Ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin' off two gages with my cape on wrong
Son, it's on, remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me, y'all! ("Hey!")
National and geographic down to the titty-bar
Rep Monster Island City, y'all!
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettlin' bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them
Meddlin' kids!
("Over here!")

[Outro: Sample]
"Hey!"
"Hey!"

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Living off borrowed time, the clock tick faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gun fight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
Whеn he have the mic, it's likе the place get like: "Aw, yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out, like "Aye, aye, captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it?
And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh, Lord"s
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
Either that or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fucked type of message that sends to the fiends
That's why he bring his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

[Outro: MF DOOM]
When he at the mic, you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Cotex
Exercise index, won't need Bowflex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex

[Part 1] (Curls)

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Villain get the money like curls
They just tryin' to get a nut like squirrels in his mad world
Land of milk and honey with the swirls
Where reckless naked girls get necklaces of pearls
Compliments of the town jeweler
Left back now-schooler tryna sound cooler
On the microphone known as the crown ruler
Never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah
Five-hundred somethin' dollars layin' right there in the street
Huh, now let's try and get somethin' to eat
Then he turned four and started flowin' to the poor
That's about when he first started going raw
Kept the 'dro in the drawer
A rhymin' klepto who couldn't go up in the store no more
His life is like a folklore legend
Why you so stiff, you need to smoke more, bredren
Instead of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
Spliff made him swore he saw heaven he was seven
Yup, you know it, growin' up too fast
Showin' up to class with Moet in a flask
He ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
His girl is home alone, he tryin' to get the ...
If you want a sip get a paper water fountain glass
How I'm 'posed to know where your mouth been last?
Hands so fast he can out-spin Flash
Known to smoke a whole mountain of hash to the ash
Boom-bash, leave the room with the stash
Assume it's in a smash, DOOM get the cash

[Part 2] (Great Days)

[Intro: MF DOOM]
It never really mattered too much to me
That I was just too damn old to emcee
All that really matters is if your rhymes was ill
Girl, that's all that really mattered to me, oh baby

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Looks like it's gonna be a great day today
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight
Looky here, it's just the way the cookie tear
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list
Some even say he might need some pus-sychiatrist
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling
My posse's on Broadway like Mama, I Want to Sing!
Mad plays the bass like the race card
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude
But this stuff is like what you might put on movie food
Uh, what is jalapeños?
Get it like a whoopin' when you holla at your seniors
Dolla he can overhear the hashish fienda
He just came from over there, the grass is greener
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes
And I wish they fixed the door to the matrix, there's mad glitches
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
One thing this party could use is more... ahem
Booze, put yourself in your own shoes
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use
He only keep 'em to decorate
If you wanna peep 'em, select a date
And bring a deep check, like checkmate
I kid you not, on the dotted line signed
Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein
On a diamond mine grind, she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought it's too thick
His assistant said: "DOOM, you sick," he said "True" through acoustics
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning
With micro power he's sound and right reasoning
It's easy as pi, three-point-one-four
One more one false move and they're done for—

[Intro]
Ayo, yo, y'all can’t stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum, close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

[Verse 1]
Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of ’em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from fivе years laying and stayed the samе
Saying, electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slid into the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U's was pure Brita water filter juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money

[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

[Verse 2]
Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
"Oh, you're too kind!" "Really? Thanks!"
To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine"
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make ’em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her, "No credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it’s all gack"
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

[Chorus]
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but tell about the broke times

[Verse 1]
Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give ’em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
Saying, "Electromagnetic feeling blocks all logical, Spock"
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit her to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water filter juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money

[Chorus]
We sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but tell about the broke times

[Bridge: Sample]
"In your arms tonight
She'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay"

[Outro: Cucumber Slice]
Check it out, y'all! Ya don’t stop! Keep on, to the sure shot!
Huh-ha! What the deal, god? Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh!
Yeah, you're listening to the buttery slickness
The Land-O-Lakes from my man MF DOOM!
Ha ha ha ha! Yeah!
Rock-shocking the house, with another nugget
Uh-uh-ah, eh, oh, ah, hoo-wee!
Yeah! Yeah!
Regulation status, right here
Fondle 'Em Recordings, 1999
Yeah!
Now what are you 'posed to say on the end of records?
I don't know! Yeah! Woo! Yeah!
Mashed potatoes!
Apple sauce!
Buttery... biscuits!
And I get lost
A yes, yes, yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
Keep on, a' to the break-a-dawn
Say what?
Uh!
Yeah!
You thought it all was over!
You thought the song was over!
Ah! We tricked you! We tricked you!
Ha ha ha ha... Woo!
You listening to www dot hairline dot com
MF DOOM, Kool Bob Love...

[MF Grimm]
Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me
Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree
All done cold blood waking up in cold sweats
This is such a cold world unconscious getting death threats
Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body
It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me
Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper
Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper
Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off
Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you
I do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever
Angels waste the time, they work together
Scheme and plot on me, cause I'm the son of man
I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam
Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me
I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me
Put me out my misery, I live in misery
I kill all my enemies, cause I love company
Those who seek me, are called wise men
Or either wise-guys I pray you comprehend
And realize I'm condemned
No rest, homicidal dreams
My cellmate, all he do is scream
Out loud how he wants to go home
That's funny, I'm here all alone
Locked, in a single cell
His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell
And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat
I call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets
"Where'd he go?" he walk through walls, run halls, I pray "teach me"
They don't see him at the health they try to reach me
I said "please see how he feels"
They said, "He's alright but he's not real"
Evaluations say I suffer from depression
Hallucinations, self-creations, what they're guessin'
I'm here doing years, I'm stressin'
Medicate me, sedate me want me to rest an'
Don't take it cause he said that won't be best an'
He said I need his help and he needs me
"Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free"

Home, that was far and he was turned off
Cause his wings was burned off
A lesson was learned, communicate with one
I was chosen cause I'm God's son

[MF Doom]
And I'm the retarded one!
(*sings*) Out in the streets
You won't survive with, wack-ass beats ("We can see that!")
These days and times
Watch as we get ours with rhymes
To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast-iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosovik
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speak-easy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehosaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic be like "tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko
Thought I might do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes
Yet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
Butter, word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop's Benny Hill sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate
My metal-face hoes with tongue or (at) least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
And the super-villain strike again like lightning
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?
And a name-drop like pick the name out the hat
That's a no jiver from the, liver conniver
Who vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I
Drop through greens like a nerd cat with intended speech from way back
And spin on your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking
Super-duper stars need Ortho-TriCylin
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
(Uhh, I hear voices)
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villain
Mary—you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower—subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see-through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich look like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailеr-load (trailer load)
Know the right number, you can gеt her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder, like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it (Ally)
Unlike Ally—sometimes she get bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never met Evie
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty mad fine 'n' much thinner
If caught, I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds (Lucy)
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park, that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said, "You need to stop messing with that white girl
She fuckin' with your head and got your heart in a tight curl" (cookie)
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish (Miss Hazy)
And Miss Hazy; older woman, mature, Black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is that she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

[Intro]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

[Verse]
There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
Like, "It's on me—put it on my tab, kid"
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
You'rе leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush thе mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him, "Get off it," and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
"To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain" — take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
"How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?"
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, "What you doing, G?
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!"
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MCs sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out — one, two, three — no bodies, please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
A whole string of jobs like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store

[Skit 1]
There, it is done
Now that the representative from South Africa has been
Mind programmed
All of the world leaders on earth are under my control
And when they meet tomorrow in special session
I, DOOM, shall be voted: Master of the World
My plan is foolproof, but just in case
And what about snow?

[Outro: Skit 2]
Now you keep your eyes open
When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)
Uh, ladies und gentlemen
I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern
That I must warn you, I, I
You must listen
Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over
(What a story, start snappin’)
DOOM, gosh, I wish I’d brought my autograph book
(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head
You’re weird
Why is everyone staring at us?
(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)
Relax masseur, just do your thing
(Get a good grip on my—)
What? Why, I’ll bend your read-out meter for ya, you little
(Hey, knock it off, Ben)
What’s the matter? (Oh, Ben)
You’re nothing but a chicken-head
(You overgrown granite-head) Hold it

[Verse]
Render unto Geedorah what is Geedorah's
Ten to one he sees ya through a beaker and a tweezers
Read the fine print and be like, "What's the big deal?"
Spun wheels of steel since broke wheel Big Wheel
Back when it was greasy S-curl, now it's easy dread
Had a rhyme on how they used to tease him 'bout his peasy head
Yes-yes-y'all to the beat, have it bald or Avacor
Have it your way, or grab his drawer, Jabberjaw
Since two tone Lee's, these new phonies is boney ho's
Lonely, like cheese and balogna only
I could've broke my "sacro-philly-ac"
Silly grind, Billy Jack, illy nine, milli black
Listen to it go "bang!" Through and through a Kangol
A strange combination of a king who teach slang flow
Two-thirds slow, one-third amazing
Wonder words, fine sponsor of this Thunderbird occasion
And have an iller rhyme, at least by Miller Time
Collect the skrilla, and geese with a killer dime
Met her out in Killa Queens, originally she from the Philippines
I love the way she fill her jeans
Still a teen, and made for strange bedfellows
Okay, so it's head to elbows for shell-toes
Uh-oh, heads up! There she blows
A whole load of Head & Shoulders, and who care where she goes
Let the music take control
Just don't let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
It's like putting fire to fake gold, it turn colors
And get duller than a bake roll with no butter
The shutter of a cake hole
Who break drakes 'til it get old and flake mold
Cornball, have 'em seeing white stars, I warned y'all
Like getting hit with a bottle of Mo' from Sean Paul
"He not white" ... Oh, he mad light though
Either which way, they not ready for the lightning show
They can't scandalize mine
You could ask a swine who can't stands when I shine
Geedorah the professor, add a question to the lessons
He suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
It's too stressing, did he stutter like rookie yes-men?
Or did he just bring the butter, like the cookie chessmen
This just in: they ain't even worth the worry
Lying on their first birth, and couldn't even hurt a Smurf-berry
Hear ye, hear ye! How dare ye
Go up against the king who do his thing tri-yearly?
They too carefree with their mouths around here
Off with his head, and display it at Town Square
On top a seven-feet spike, make sure it's on tight
In light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
Skull get smashed for weeks
'Til vulture beaks eats the last meat off the cheeks
Maybe then they'll know the right words to speak
Out loud, at home, in the world, or in the streets
There's no escape, just in case
All the kings' mens and 'em decides to go apes
The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
Even those that's Mr. Furley's size that earned the fate
Can all get burned at the stake
Send word to his closest kins, that for his sins
We claim his throne, his providence, and its citizens
In the name of King Geedorah!
Don't make him catch a seizure

[Outro: Samples]
"We regret that you have not yet complied with our order
We interpret this as a negative reply
We are prepared therefore to conquer the earth"
"We have stationed King Geedorah in the Western Hemisphere
Geedorah was always one of their weapons
And King Geedorah is completely controlled by our computers through magnetic waves"
"Are you a homo? (Like the others)
We help thousands of homos every month!"
"All I’m saying right…
Is in the old days right..
The women knew who the women were
The men knew who the men were
The women knew who the men were
And the men knew who the women were."
"I'm here to tell you that the future of your planet is at stake
I urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth"
"Now do you feel like telling me where your leader is?"

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
By the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop(pop)
In a instant get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Ho's get ripped off like Nicorette patch
In real life the real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle, dead up setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
The unemotional call me anti-social
On the run off thе gun death tally commercial
Death vallеy is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps G.M., MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin on my floor or delivery front door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers master yours
My disaster cause: Hell... in gas drawls
The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillins
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Dont make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin in my dealings (while I'm)
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen'
Holdin, foldin the pal
Known as massive-versatile
I’d like to big-em-up Monsta Isle

[Break: MF DOOM]
Uummm, Yeah
I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Mhm

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for, two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
Who every hooker hearda', next to malicious murda'
A track type vicious fulfillin the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O who predict ya last pause
I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls
Breakin glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret war wit' them Fantastic Four (invisible bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state
The ho better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas is froze like icicles (bag 'em up)
And baggin' bitches like nickels
Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though
I'ma split till I pronounce More hits than a ounce no doubt
About ta bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out

[Outro: MF DOOM]
And I like to give a shoutout to the brother Jet Jaguar
Megalon and King Geedorah
I call this joint right here Gas Drawls
In Hell with yours

[Intro: Jason Derulo]
Uh, Jason Derulo
Oh, yeah

Ooh, girl, we notice, your body the coldest

[Chorus]
What you say, is what you believe
Everybody wants a piece of me
I'm so alive, but I still can’t breathe
From the presence that surrounded me
Present, that's anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh
Anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Need a second, need a minute, need a moment
Coming up in front of you, it ain't easy
Running all over but the world still needs me
Gotta stay reloaded
Need a day, need a month, need a year off
’Cause I'm not tough when you don't miss me, feel anxiety

[Chorus]
What you say, is what you believe
Everybody wants a piece of mе
I'm so alive, but I still can't breathe
From thе presence that surrounded me
Present, that's anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh
Anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Need a second, need a minute, need a moment
Coming up in front of you, it ain't easy
Running all over but the world still needs me
Gotta stay reloaded
Need a day, need a month, need a year off
'Cause I’m not tough when you don’t miss me
(But do you miss me?), feel anxiety
Don't believe everything you see

[Chorus]
What you say, is what you believe
Everybody wants a piece of me
I’m so alive, but I still can't breathe
From the presence that surrounded me
Present, that's anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh
Anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh

[Verse]
Now what's the use? (What’s the use?)
We pop that booze (Pop that booze)
You see that model, got that bottle, now we lose (No, no, no)
Now who you choose? (Who you choose?)
I see you too (I see you too)
I got a penthouse out in Sunset, so come through, okay, girl
Holla if you down the road, 'cause I got the fire then I gotta roll
And I got the diamonds and they on the go
Hey, I'm off the Y and I'm about to blow, uh-uh
No more time for wasting, time ain't got for wasting time
(Don't waste time)
Yeah, I'ma keep that girl
I won't forget that girl, she know she makes me blind

[Chorus]
Anxiety
So lost in it (So lost in it), push it to the limit (Push it to the limit)
So lost in it, oh
Anxiety (Yeah, yeah)
So lost in it (So lost in it), push it to the limit (Push it to the limit)
So lost in it (So lost in it), oh (Push it to the limit)

[Post-Chorus]
Need a second, need a minute, need a moment
Coming up in front of you, it ain't easy
Running all over but the world still needs me
Gotta stay reloaded
Need a day, need a month, need a year off
'Cause I'm not tough when you don't miss me
(But do you miss me?), feel anxiety
Don't believe everything you see

[Chorus]
What you say, is what you believe
Everybody wants a piece of me
I'm so alive, but I still can't breathe
From the presence that surrounded me
Present, that's anxiety

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Whoa oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Ever since I met you, babe
I couldn't fight this feeling, oh no
I'm the type to give you everything I have
She’s priceless for real, oh whoa
You don’t ever have to do a thing
But give me all your love and affection, oh whoa
You have something going for yourself
That’s the type of girl for me

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Take you on a trip right by my side
To a special place where we belong (Ooh)
So many things that are on my mind
Can't wait to get you all alone (Ooh)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Hey girl, you're something out a magazinе
You're something off a movie screen
(Somеthing off a movie screen)
Hey girl, I need you, more than words could say
(Whoa, whoa, oh babe)
Hey girl (Hey babe), you’re something like a silhouette (Yeah)
What you see is what you get, oh
Hey girl (Girl), I need you, more than words could say (Whoa, whoa)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey girl, do I feel like everything in my life (My life)
Jump again and end with late night
I think I love you more than I love me (I really do)
You say you love me more, is that right? (Yeah)
I doubt it I change the thing that I can
If you could never mind the thing that I can't
If you appreciate the man that I am
And not remind me the things that I ain't
I can't just stand around and be fake (Nah)
'Cause of the type of people we hate (Haha)
It's a private estate, you wrapped around my heart
Can't believe I let you walk through these gates
Love seein' your tattoos and your toes out
From a presidential to a fold guy
You stuck with me, I'm fuckin' with you
Suck and whine, throwing down with you
I saw what I want, I took that (Took it)
Since then shawty a look bad (Never)
If them don't wanted you as much as I do (Heh)
If I would tell you to get to it bad (Shown up)
This is staying like me, girl (I see you, girl)
And my boo, you're a keeper, girl (You're a keeper, girl)
Smile every time I see you, girl (I see you, girl)
Hurts every time I leave a girl (Ay)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Take you on a trip right by my side
To a special place where we belong (Ooh)
So many things that are on my mind
Can’t wait to get you all alone (Ooh)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Hey girl, you're something out a magazine
You're something off a movie screen
(Something off a movie screen)
Hey girl, I need you, more than words could say

Hey girl (Hey babe), you’re something like a silhouette (Yeah)
What you see is what you get, oh

Hey girl (Hey babe), you’re something like a silhouette (Yeah)
What you see is what you get, oh
Hey girl (Girl), I need you, more than words could say (Whoa, whoa)
I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, well
That's all I'm living for, yeah

I didn't want to pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come, running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah!
I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild, ooo ooo ooo

I didn't want to pressure you, baby, no
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come, running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah!
I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah
She saw me walking down the streets
Of your fine city
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me
And said, "C'mere"
Now I don’t usually talk to strangers
But she looked so pretty
What can I lose
If I, uh, just give her a little ear?
"What's up little girl?"
"I ain't got time to play."
Baby didn’t say too much
She said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by suprise
I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes
And I said, "No, are u?"
Said to myself, said
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy
Little mixed up dame
She's just a victim of society
And all it's games."
Now wherе I come from
We don't let sociеty

Everybody say (work)
We're going to work all night
Everybody (let's work) that's right everybody, everybody (let's work)

[Verse 1]
I'm going down to Alphabet Street
I'm going to crown the first girl that I meet
I'm going to talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet
I'm going to drive my daddy's Thunderbird (My daddy's Thunderbird)
A white rad ride, '66 ('67) so glam it's absurd
I'm going to put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
But I guess tonight I'm just not, I'm just not in the mood
So if you don't mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would like to watch
We're going down, down, down, if that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better day
"Oh, I got a live one here!"

Get the funk up!

To make the devil go, go
"This town needs an enema!"
Hahahaha

[Verse 1]
Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side, the hunger satisfied

[Chorus]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
Oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Wе'll never know, we'll nеver know
What stands behind the door
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's worth dying for

[Chorus]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
Oh
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I’ll know if this is right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I feel you (Feel you) pumping through my veins, ha!
Am I into you, or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can’t tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Verse 2]
The room is full but all I see is
The way your еyes just blaze through me
Likе fire in the dark
We're like living art, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me, hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame? Yeah

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it’s the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we’re a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Bridge]
So come on, baby
Keep provoking me
Keep on roping me
Like a rodeo
Pull me close
Here we go, here we go, here we go yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame? Yeah

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
’Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe we’re a masterpiece
Sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)

[Chorus]
I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
'Cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

[Verse 1]
In my backpack
I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And yo is so weakin'
With anger and discontent
Some are seeking and searching like me, moi
I'm a peace-loving decoy
Ready for retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box six-under
Impulsive don't ask wild wonder
Orders given to me is
Strike and I'm thunder with lightning fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no dropping pressure

[Chorus]
I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
'Cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

[Verse 2]
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see you brake
They can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you flipped your soosa
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety days digit
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
Mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life
It seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert
With my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker with the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

[Chorus]
I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
'Cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

Coastin', cruisin', with a white girl from across town

You told me it wasn't over and that we'd be together soon
But was this before or after you told me to leave your room?
I used to think we'd make it far, it turned out that we are
It's such a shame that we weren't the same at all

They couldn't take that from me
I got slugs who want heat
They want grub, who want beef? (Uh)
They want love, they got me
Listen

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg, Merlyn Wood & A$AP Rocky]
Shit on your function, live from the dungeon (Woo, damn)
Don't know why you cuffin', my dick, she be toungin'
You ain't got drip like this, can't talk like this (Woo)
Safety pin on wrist, I put racks on my lil' bitch, uh
Speak of the truth, two K a tooth, oof
Maybach Jeep, huh, raise the roof
Know that you envy me, but I am hater-proof
Talkin' with Diddy, I made me a milli' in about a day or two
Woo, ayy, filled with lust
Wanted to hear what Hype Williams talkin' 'bout
Bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talking 'bout video treatments and such (Damn)
But I'm busy lovin' on the IG, smut, damn, fuck
I'm a G.O.A.T. in a Lamb' truck
Tell the video, "Pan up when you talk to me"
Godzilla, trilla nigga, rip apart your teeth (Coo-coo)
Side niggas in the pocket of my varsity (Damn)
They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & A$AP Rocky]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always coming in your dreams (Bankroll)
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always coming in your dreams

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood & Matt Champion]
Won't take off my armor now
Can't afford not to splurge on her
Had to break down the Berlin Wall
Just to come talk to ya
Who hurt ya? I'll break his jaw
Young, handsome, with major plans
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
The topic today be the wallet
My lady be spending, investing
Whatever you doing, I wallop
Now I get out departments
Why my jewelry looking like tuition to college?
Whatever you do, do not stop it
If you wanna salad all up in your pocket
I must be addicted to only the process
Don't say I'm too big for ya
Man, my head big, it's fallin' off
But I fit, no problem
Make it fit like nuts and bolts
One nut and I'm boltin' off
Your ex income minimum
Baby run with some bigger dons
Baby run with some bigger dons
I split the wave and they glisten like whoop-de-doo
Back of the truck with the stack like I'm Scooby-Doo
Wagging that tail like I'm chugging Don Julio
Bitch in the back and they staring like, "Who are you?"
I got the cash and it last 'cause I dash to the bag
My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like the light, ayy

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & A$AP Rocky]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always coming in your dreams (Bankroll)
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at a party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always coming in your dreams

[Verse]
Never ever could I ever imagine
All of this happening the way that it happened
I know I said I wouldn't give love a chance
But you're an exception
That's why it fucks me up whenever you fuck up
Because with everything you asking me, I never asked for none
And it scares me the way that you lie with no effort
Then lie in my bed and tell me that you meant it, you're sеlfish
My friends say I do it to myself and I do
'Cause, somеhow I always forgive you
And you say that you love me and swear that you do
But sometimes I have doubts and question if it's true

[Chorus]
But still, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one (Still, you're the only one)
You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, uh, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one (Still, you're the only one)

[Verse 1]
The timing is the essence, It's a miracle we stay strong
I'm lost inside the elements, this love is like a snow storm

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm seeing your rainbow but I'm trapped inside a cloud
(Let me twist your circle)
I'm waiting for sunlight to come through and melt me out
('Cause I'm losing control now)

[Chorus]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
The waves are getting wetter and we mentalize our heart burn
My skin is getting red, I see your eyes and you're not concerned

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm seeing your darkness while I float around your moon
(Let me twist your circle)
You're writing your words over the walls inside my tomb
(Got me under control now)

[Chorus]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, falling in love with you

[Bridge]
When I fall into your super love
'Cause I never seem to get enough
So give me all of your super love
I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, falling in love with you

[Chorus]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, falling in love with you

[Outro]
When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me

Die here in your arms, falling in love with you

[Intro]
Woah-oh

You know the time it is
It's time we have some make up sex

[Verse]
Let's fuck in the kitchen, I'm tryna make sure that you with it
You know that I get it
You got a spot and you know that I hit it
You got somebody new, you got somebody
And you know that that nigga, he just don't hit it
'Cause if he hit it the way that I hit it right now you just would not be with me
You gotta keep it a buck with yourself
Before I chase you, I'ma fuck with myself
Damn, I don't wan' fuck with myself
'Cause it's lonely when I fuck with myself
Low-key when I fuck with myself
All of these nights of spending alone
Whеn I get to endin' that pussy
You know you gon' low-key havе to throw me the belt
You told me last night when we fucked, this was the best head you ever got, don't lie
You told me last night when we fucked, this was the best sex you ever got, no, don't lie
I'm getting chills, you and your latest new nigga cannot be for real
You wanna blame us fuckin' on the liquor, but you know you wanted to fuck on your feels
Go spend your time in Texas
Now you just one of my exes
I ain't even 'bout to stress it
'Cause when I go find me somebody better, promise that it's gon' hurt
Yeah, it's gon' hurt
It's gon' fuckin' hurt
I promise that you gonna feel how I feel and that's hurt
I'm hurtin', babe
And I'm so ashamed

[Intro]
Come in

[Verse 1]
I know you went and found somebody new (Ooh, woah, woah)
When all my friends are showing me new pics of you (Oh, oh)
All on the 'Gram with yo' man
Smilin', holdin' hands like
He just do you so much better than I do (Ooh, woah, woah)
Knew this day would soon be comin'
Guess I didn't expect that it'd be this soon
I guess what I'm tryna to say is (Say, say, say, say, yeah)
I know this ain't right for the time, but

[Chorus]
Y'all don't look right together (Look right)
Y'all don't look right together (Look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (Look right)
Y'all don't look right together (Look right)
Y'all don't look right togethеr
You look like mine forevеr, mine forever

[Verse 2]
Know I sound like I'm hating when I'm being honest (Ooh, woah, woah)
Just tryna put my feelings somewhere I can't find them (Oh, oh)
'Cause them shits have me actin' scary
Feel like a knife is goin' through my chest and I can't seem to get it out
Look, when we argued, it was nothin' this bad
Everything you do, it seem to make me so sad
But it don't mean that we should not get time to reconvene
'Cause who you need is me and, plus y'all don't look right

[Chorus]
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together (Y'all don't look right)
Y'all don't look right together
You look like mine forever, mine forever

[Outro: Talkbox]
Show, ooh woah, woah
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Part 1]

[Verse]
I hope you find somebody more toxic
And y'all go through way more arguments than we did
Y’all go through way more arguments than needed
You better give him the same fuckin' treatment
I know it's just the intro and this shit get deep, but
I’ve got my reasons
I put my work in, it wasn't worth it
My stresses turned you to the person for somebody else
I made you worth it for somebody else
I endured all of your flaws 'til I broke through all the walls of your guard
Now you're perfect for somebody else
I'm ‘bout to call her, bruh, I ain't gon' lie
I know she's somewhere with a good guy, no
She’s out with a guy who push a pretty penny
Her friend just let me know, she said he gets more paper than me, yeah (Damn)
There goes my ego
This shit is weak though
My heart is cold, this shit is brick
My shit is Shaq at the free-throw
Tryna get you back with all these cheap hoes
And you don’t even peep though
I let you take 'til there was nothing left of me
I seen it all ’til there was nothing left to see
I know she would leave me, what you telling me?
‘Cause when it's said and done, all I got is these melodies
You wasn't there when I was selling CDs
Juggin' at the TD, I was making CiCi’s
Money comin' out, I'm watchin' it in 3D
You told me I'd be nothing, now I'm on the TV
Fast forward, couple years later, see me, yeah
Come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, bitch
Car futuristic, shit, it come with three seats
Took the last feedback, it don't come with TVs
I stopped wearin' Chrome Hearts and AMIRI jeans
Gettin' too much money and it's bustin' out the seams
Shawty, don't act like I didn't meet you on the scene
I only slept on you because you started sellin' dreams
Oh my God, I don't even know, I'm so ashamed right now

[Part 2]

[Intro]
She been fuckin' rich niggas since nineteen (Since nineteen)
No money inside her bags, just drugs and Maybelline (Maybelline)
Seems like money's got you doing anything
Anything, anything
Servin' looks, you deaded me all for the finer things
Fuck me good and then you tellin' me all kinda things
It's like money's got you doing different type of things
Honestly, like I don't know why I did that, but I did, yeah
Girl, I heard you fucked that nigga in some shit I bought you
It hurts to know that that's some different shit I taught you
You left me for someone that was icy
With all that ice, don't you forget you gotta

[Chorus]
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the ‘Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the ‘Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me, yeah

[Verse]
What it's hittin' for? I'm toxic, you know it (You know it)
Even your friends say I'm not shit, and you know it (You know it)
She hops in my double-R, she'd rather cry tears in the stars
And she knows them other guys in the double-R ain't like us
They ain't doing it like us
Movie is playin' and they ain't queuing it like us
Maybe I'm toxic, maybe I'm not shit
You went and found yourself another option
Liquor, I'm gon' sip
Sip until I get depressed in this bitch
Then I'ma call you right up on the flip
Fifty reasons why your nigga ain't shit
Fuck them niggas if I'm not at the top
I go crazy, I'ma make this shit hot
DM your nigga and blow up your spot
Fuck up the relationship that you've got
Fucked it up and now I'm calling you mine
There's no real intention of making you mine
I just don't wanna see you with no one else
Like I'm the only one allowed to move on
(I told you)
I'm a fuckboy for sayin' that shit, girl, I know it
I don't deserve you for playin' that like that, I know it (I know it)
But through these toxic eyes, I see potential
Took advantage of the fact you gotta

[Chorus]
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the ‘Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah
If it's on the ‘Gram, on the TV, yeah
Gonna see me, gonna see me

[Outro]
Want me to call, don't you? Don't you?
Every time that I sing, every time that I sing
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time that I see you, every time that I see you
Why don't you return my calls?
You trip 'bout, where I be
But you don't come and see me
No, you don't come and see me

[Part 1: Extravagant Bullshit]

[Verse]
Shawty, after all the fighting, the fucking's better (Damn)
You got your left one and your right in, all of your vendetta
You punched me in my fuckin' jaw, you ain't have to do that
You swung again and hit the wall, but I had to move back
I'm buying Plain Janes only for my main thing
She still got the nerve to argue, I guess that's the way of things
All she do is bitch at me like that's the way of sayin' things
Bought this bitch a hunnid bags like they don't do the same thing (Same thing)
Shit don't ever change, it don't ever change
Even when I try to change my ways, you gon' stay the same
Then you wanna pop up on me 'cause my feelings David Blaine
Got them disappearing niggas, listen up and hear this, nigga
How many of us bought this bitch a watch, and it ain't change shit? (Yes, I did)
How many of us bought this bitch a bag, and it ain't change shit? (I did)
How many of us bought this bitch a car, and it ain't change shit?
Man, it hurts to say, but some of y'all bitches ain't shit (Damn)
I might need some therapy (Therapy)
The last bitch I fucked with, lied and tried to publicly embarrass me (Yes, she did)
So this album will not be about her this time
'Cause all that lying she did, fucked with my real bitch
Big time, this the sixth time I done fucked up
Big lie, got my bitch cryin' in the tub, drunk
She just caught me in 4K getting fucked up
Two bitches going both ways like some nunchucks

[Part 2: Nunchucks]

[Intro]
Nunchucks, nunchucks
Nunchucks, nunchucks
Nunchucks, nunchucks
Nunchucks, nunchucks
Nunchucks, nunchucks
Nunchucks, nunchucks

[Chorus]
I got two different bitches go both ways like some nunchucks
They fuck me good, on hood, if you hatin', I give one fuck
She wanna stay with me, well, I'm gon' let her stay with me
I got two different bitches switchin' positions, it's up, up
And if it's up, you know that that shit can get stuck, stuck
Come drip on my chocolate, shawty, come show me what's up
I got two bitches going both ways like some, uh (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Like some, uh (Ooh)
Like some, uh (Damn)
Like some, uh

Like some, uh
Like some, uh (Damn)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I said, lil' bitch, I'm buggin'
Got two different women fuckin'
Don't leave home with your emotions
Girl, let's all get into something
I'm tryna fuck something so we can just quit discussion
I get the shit, but I, I get the shit bustin'
Call me up, up, uh
Houston, Atlanta, Vegas
Wherever you like to get naked, that's where I plan to take you
All 'round the telly, got you in lingerie masquerading
Say she a masochist, well, come give your master a kiss
I bought her a bag and then gave that shit to my other bitch
Look, you on some other shit, no, I do not fuck with this
Shawty, please, let me breathe, keep it G
Got me to my knees, pussy smell like summer's eve
I'ma fuck you both and leave like Jacquees

[Chorus]
I got two different bitches go both ways like some nunchucks
They fuck me good, on hood, if you hatin', I give one fuck
She wanna stay with me, well, I'm gon' let her stay with me
I got two different bitches switching positions, it's up, up
And if it's up, you know that shit can get stuck, stuck
Come drip on my chocolate, shawty, come show me what's up
I got two bitches going both ways like some, uh (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Like some, uh (Ooh)
Like some, uh (Damn)
Like some, uh

Like some, uh
Like some, uh (Damn)
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
You believe that I'd just up and forget that shit?
I mean at the start, I thought about letting this go
Adam and Eve, I know they wish they never did that shit
It was still in the garden, but some things we just have to let go
Joke's on me, I gave up all this pussy cat that's in my lap
No looking back, and watched you leave from me
But is the joke on me or you? 'Cause that new nigga that you got, he's not flea
He's not flea (He's not flea)
And not only that, he's not me
He's not me
You believe at times I mistaked what your worth is
I believe, all I did was try to show you purpose
We believe, ooh, we believe
If we would've met different times in life, then this shit would've been perfect
But it's imperfect, baby
And is it worth it, baby?
Calling me perfect, baby
And then just turning around and bringing me down like I'm worthless, baby
Then you got the nerve to snap at me when I bring it up to the surface, baby
I mean, the double standard, it get crazy
The double standard, it get wild
I wanted you to have my fuckin' baby
Now I'm standing with this crooked smile
Does that other nigga make you smile?
Do that other nigga make you crazy?
'Cause these other niggas, they be hating (Yeah, uh)
I heard another nigga got your body
I heard another nigga got your soul
I know another nigga got it sewed up (Uh)
It's only your body, shawty, it be scrollin'
Beat the pussy 'til it's swollen
Give a fuck who I o-ffend (Oh)
Sippin' Don P, got us open
If you're horny, bust it open
Baby, trust me, I'm chosen (Uh)
But I don't stress the odds
'Cause with all the odds against me, I still thought that I was better than we thought
And I don't question God
But God, why did you have to give her someone better than me?
Knife inside my heart and it keep stabbing
Embarrassed of the times that I was bragging
Through all the embarrassment, I want you back in, back in, back in
Oh, no (Uh, look)
I know I'm toxic
You know I'm toxic
Your momma know we toxic
She insist we stop this
But I insist that we hop on a jet, go to the tropics
And just switch the topic
'Cause you know all I want is you to see, see
'Cause all I want is you to see a half of me
And I know you'll see

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Just keepin' it real with you
Just come to the spot later, stop playin'
Nah, girl, stop fuckin' play
Yeah
Uh, look

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
When it feels good, but it don't mean nothing
That don't mean a thing to me (That don't)
When it feels good, but it don't mean nothing (Oh, yeah, no)
Baby, that's a no for me
What we supposed to be?
Making good love till the morning
Working and working some
Giving good head till the morning
Writing in cursive with my tongue
When it feels good, but it don't mean nothing
It can feel good, but it don't mean nothing (Yeah)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Nyce]
We both in the mood for sex and we about to get it on
I just wanna know before we fuck, girl, is the love as strong?
Once we get to fucking, it's all year now, bettеr fuck me long
Once we gеt to fucking, girl, it's on, it's on
This ain't time for playing, girl, it's on (It's on)
This ain't time for playing, girl, it's on (It's on)
You can't turn it off once it's on (It's on)
Ain't no time to play, that's what I'm on

[Verse 2: Nyce]
It's getting hot, and, girl, it's ready
And I can turn this into a movie if you let me
She's on top got me saying, "Aw, yeah" now
Oh, if you scared, tell me what you want
'Cause this ain't time for playing, girl (For playing, girl)
No, you my favorite, girl (My favorite, girl)
No, no, you my favorite
While we fuck under the sun
I'm just here to tell you, girl, it's on

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Nyce]
We both in the mood for sex and we about to get it on
I just wanna know before we fuck, girl, is the love as strong?
Once we get to fucking, it's all year now, better fuck me long
Once we get to fucking, girl, it's on, it's on
This ain't time for playing, girl, it's on (It's on)
This ain't time for playing, girl, it's on (It's on)
You can't turn it off once it's on (It's on)
Ain't no time to play, that's what I'm on

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
It's been the longest goodnight
Well, can I welcome you to heartbreak? (Heartbreak)
Can I welcome you to heartbreak? (Heartbreak)
'Cause, baby, you know I go against the grain for you
So many times (Oh, yeah)
Got my heart breaks, oh (Heartbreak)
Got my fucking heart race, yeah-yeah, oh

[Interlude: Tory Lanez]
A sucker, like a real sucker
That's, that's really how you was doin' me
A fucking sucker, you know what I'm sayin' like
Like you some, you some sort of big stepper
Like I'm a placemat, I'm a doormat
You supposed to walk over me to somethin', like
You must be out your fucking mind
Like, matter of fact, fuck that
This how we gonna do this
Just give me my fucking keys, give me my fu-
Nah, nah, nah, fuck that, give me my chain
Give me the ring I bought you, everything
I'm on all, all bitter time
All kind Franks, don't act, you too, shorty
Matter of fact, you know what, suck my dick

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
It's been the longest goodnight (Heartbreak)
Well, can I welcome you to heartbreak? (Heartbreak)
Can I welcome you to heartbreak? (Heartbreak)

[Verse 1]
Honestly, I’m embarrassed
I’ve been so fucking careless
Caught in my fucking ways
You should not have to wait
I’ve been so fucking selfish
Insecure ‘cause I’m jealous
I want nobody with ya
Still got my sneaky link ups
I know I’m wrong for that
Guess these are my confessions
I know I lied so many times that I believed my answers
I know I made you wait
You shouldn’t have to wait
Used to beg me to stay
You shouldn’t have to stay
You went and found an athlete
Now I hate fuckin’ athletes
I was too fuckin’ flashy
I couldn’t keep it classy
You found somebody wealthy
He gets more paper than me
Honestly, I’m embarrassed
Booked a one way to Paris

[Chorus]
‘Cause when it gets like this, I need distance
I’m on a twelve-hour flight with just my feelings
It can get like this in an instant
Soon as I get into thinkin’ that nigga done fucked you like I did
Like he sucked you like I did
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did
Nigga done fucked you like I did
Like he sucked you like I did
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did

[Post-Chorus]
Now all of a sudden
You don’t owe me nothing to tell me whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is

[Verse 2]
Depression, obsession is selfish
Somehow just drownin' in summer depression is helpin'
It really ain’t helping, no, it ain’t helpin', no, it ain’t helping' no
This shit ain’t healthy, this shit ain’t healthy, this isn’t healthy
Booked you a flight to come out to me, you didn’t take it
That was the moment I realized we wouldn’t make it
Ego was hurt so I went to the port and I booked me a ticket
Had to get missing, I had to get distant

[Interude]
It’s in my stomach, this fuckin’ hurts, fuck

[Chorus]
‘Cause when it gets like this, I need distance
I’m on a twelve-hour flight with just my feelings
It can get like this in an instant
Soon as I get into thinkin’ that nigga done fucked you like I did
Like he sucked you like I did
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did
Nigga done fucked you like I did
Like he sucked you like I did
Does he touch you like I did? Like I did

[Post-Chorus]
Now all of a sudden
You don’t owe me nothing to tell me whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is
Fuck whoever he is

[Intro]
It's like a miracle, a miracle, a miracle, a miracle

[Chorus]
Ain't no one else in here to flaunt it

[Chorus]
Ain't no one else in here to flaunt it

Bet you could talk to me
Baby

Oh
It's like a miracle, a miracle, a miracle, a miracle
Yeah
Oh, won't you talk to me?

[Verse 3]
Tonight, fuck me
Just don't be ashamed when you do it
Lover, just fuck me in light
Like you need instructions
You can beat the game if you do it (Oh)
Number one rule is I gotta fuck you
And you gotta be a freak 'cause you know I'm one too (Too)
Rule number two (Two)
Gotta keep it G, that's when I don't like to do
'Cause, shawty, what it mean is that I'll break up with you
'Cause if it's gon' be toxic, I'ma make sure that don't make up sex is good, oh, yeah
Rule number three (Three), you can't ever, ever love no nigga more than me
Not even your daddy, I'ma be your daddy
I'm the only one that make you happy, sadly
(See what I did there? Uh)
Rule number four (Four)
Leave me for somebody else and you can't fuck me no more
Rule number five (Five)

My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so, you know
That's a bit too hard to explain (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

[Bridge 1: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)

[Pre-Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish (Yeah)
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh) (Oh)
You know you got me hypnotized (Oh)
So be wise (Sí! Uh) and keep on (Sí! Uh)
Reading the signs of my body (Yeah)

[Bridge 2: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Yeah, oh, yeah, ladies, sí! (Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it! (Yeah)
En Barranquilla se baila así (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (Huh-uh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
It's the Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

[Outro: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
No fighting
No fighting
You’re mine

Somehow I always just take you back in
Hate when we fight but we here to the end
Make me think about the very first time
When we exchanged notes and layed up all night
Crazy that I’d thought I never know
That I’d find love in this generation of empty souls
Swear I thought I would never even come see this far
Cuz feelings sometimes will make me feel like Im dead and gone
But all that changеd when I met you
Knew at first glacе something was true
You was there chilling with your friends
Swear you looked so effortless
Dont Know if I walk up or ignore ya baby
You was glowin Like the moon
I was nervous I’d fall through was wrong baby
From ya demeanor It looked like I came on you too strong
You flash smile and then ask of my name and where Im from
Then you look me up and and down to see what time Im on
Whether I am just a typical
Or if sing a different song
Cuz you know that nobody perfect
Busy searching for something thats real
You don’t know in my my mind that your worth it baby
That is why I already feel

Chorus

I have never felt so strong about somebody
You are everything I need and more
Like a drug I can’t get you right out my body
When Im diving in deep your core

You my shawty, my boo thang forever baby
Imma show you off all to the world
When I look in your eyes I see heaven baby
You’re my Queen til the end do us part


You’re my queen til the end do us part

You’re mine

Verse 2

Lovely
Can I get your number
Can I just get something bout ya for me to remember
Promise I won’t waste ya time like other dudes do you love
Don’t know how it worked
But somehow we just started talking over the phone and then all of a sudden
One text turned to two then turn to FaceTiming from night til dawn
Moved from hanging out to when the first date will be on
First date turned to second then to many years just to ask
Will you be Vanessa and to you I’ll be Gigi’s Dad
You on my mind for 24 hours and 7 days
I spend 8 of them thinking how I can make you say
Oh baby, I love you
And always know that I love you too
Chorus

I have never felt so strong about somebody
You are everything I need and more
Like a drug I can’t get you right out my body
When Im diving in deep your core

You my shawty, my boo thang forever baby
Imma show you off all to the world
When I look in your  eyes I see heaven baby
You’re my Queen til the end do us part

Shooters with the hammer behind me it's not a blogger
Keep tweetin' you get followed like a Central Park jogger
I'm hard bodied like RoboCop armor

I make you look fly and dressy
You wear 2 but on you it look kinda messy
You don't stand a chance

Your chance is slimmer than a pants on Ryan Leslie
I'm duct taped

And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (Here)

Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna & Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Rihanna & Jeezy]
All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony (Young!)
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million (Young!)
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna & Jeezy]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)

[Spoken Intro]
Usher baby, uh-huh
See something 'bout this beat go
Just make you wanna, yeah
It just got me like
It's got me like.. ohh!

[Intro]
Listen homeboys, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse 1]
Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said: "Hey, you're kind of cute" I said: "Yes, I know, but...
By the way, sweetheart, what's your name?"
She said: "My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine"
I said: "My name is the Prince" and she said: "Why?"
I said: "Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!
But enough about me, yo, let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do"
I popped some trash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town, I wined her and dined her
She asked me 'did I like her?' I said: "Well... kinda"
All of a sudden, she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin'
So I shoved her away, I said: "You better stop buggin'!"
She got mad, looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out: "Rape!"
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin' through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death
I was arrested, charged with aggravated assault
(Hey, yo Clancy, we got him!) But it wasn't my fault!

[Chorus]
Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Verse 2]
I was in a bar one Friday night
Coolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight
I was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila
When this girl walked up, she said: "Hi, my name is Sheila"
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said: "Let's go"
20 minutes later, things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house, I said: "I'm with you, toots"
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back, I said: "Oh, your hands are cold!"
We went into her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I caressed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said "Baby, where are you?"
Her boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin
And said: "Boy, I'ma tear your butt limb from limb!"
I was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?
I just yelled: "Geronimo!" and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off, I had to break in my place
Because my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case
I was done, sneezin' and coughin'... (Aaa-choo!)
I hope this doesn't happen too often, but

[Chorus]
Nevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

[Spoken Interlude: DJ Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince]
Yo man, you think they see your point?
I don't know, I don't think they really get it, man...
I think you should give 'em another example!
Aight, give me a scratch, let's make it funky right here...

[Verse 3]
I got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year
It was my girlfriend Betty, I said: "Hello dear!
I was just about to call you
I got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert" (I'm wit' it)
"It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?" (Yeah)
"Aight, fine, see you then, Betty"
I combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth
Got funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif
Got to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet
Until Betty's mom said: "Betty's not ready yet!"
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35, she comes downstairs
And said: "I need a little longer to finish my hair"
At ten o'clock, we had been missed the show
She comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?
"Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!"
I was steamin' like a demon as I drove home

[Chorus]
But it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhyme
Just remember my rhymes
Take heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!

[Outro: DJ Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince]
Man, first your parents just don't understand...
I know, right, man...
Then you have these crazy nightmares...
Look, why me? Why me?...
What's next?
Not these girls man, but... you know how it is... can't live wit' 'em..
Can't live without 'em

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
I-I-I-I woke up this morning

They say love is a gamble and if so, baby I'm the Belagio I can't lose

You a treasure to me life with you is a pleasure to me
And I'm a make sure no man ever measure to me

[Verse 2: Jada]
Woke up this morning to invite and couldn't wait to write you
I licked your back and then kissed three little kids that look just like you
Love is magic, can’t explain and sometimes it just happens
Saw your picture your so silly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and
You know my heart you know my thoughts so ruffneck yet you're tender
The only person ever locked up safe was to surrender

[Chorus]
All my love (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh

[Verse: Will]
Yo, yo, mi amor, it's like a Picasso painted your aura
It's like Beethoven composed your vocal tones
Rodin inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man (uh)
Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

[Chorus]
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

Electric Boogaloo
You play Kelly, I'll be O-Zone
Travie Laz and Taio Cruz

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Now I know how to get down on the floor (Floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore ('Nore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (Hooked)
Come over herе and take a closer look (Look)

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Taio Cruz, (Travie McCoy)]
'Cause I can't gеt enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now (Ha, ha, let's go)

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (Thrill)
I got this high without takin' a pill (Pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (Sun)
I'm dancin' like I am the only one (One)

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
I got my feet in the air and my head on the ground
And the rest of my body somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'ma be up for a minute (Uh-huh)
Such a beautiful feeling, 'idn't it?
Yup, when your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

Higher off the ground

Used to be the only one looking out for me (Uh-uh)
You ain't blood but you family (Family)
Now you think nobody needs you (No, no, no, no)
Going straight to voicemail when I'm calling you (Oh-yeah)
Haven't heard from you, it's been a while and
Not talkin' about it won't solve your problems (Problems)

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, one foot out the door (Oh, oh)
You're losing hope, I see you letting go (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t need the pretty lights
No recognition for tonight
I, I just wanna live my life, oh
Calling out my fuckin’ name
I’m a human, yes I say
I’m the same way as I came, oh

[Chorus]
I want you to love me, I want you to love me

If I got you, you know that I don’t need

If I had no-nothing no more
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?
Against wrong, choose right and be standin up
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the carseat in right
People drivin all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me
Wait an see gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, trudat
Uh-uh-uh why you do dat?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can
Show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an
An I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame it it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove
You was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm
Tryin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nuthin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go wrong
But just in case
It's my place
To impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I
Just the two of us
Just me and you
I'm always here for you
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there
Whatever you need
Just call on me
Whatever you need
I'll be there anytime
You and I
True dat, true dat
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
You and I
For the rest of your life

[Verse 1]
(Bitch)
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch (Yeah)
I want the fade (I want the fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I need the fade, I need my-
We gotta fade
Give me my fade (Fade)
We gotta fade (Fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I, I need the fade, fade
Run me my fade, fade
I can't please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got 'em hot, I got 'em greased
Shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up

[Chorus]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house

[Verse 2]
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Woah, woah)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash
Detergent, internet urgent
Time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in the cope of state of manic camouflage
Like a sheep so we slide through the cancer, lies and deceit
Vibe like a Phantom, dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won

[Chorus]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house

[Verse 1]
I only say what I really mean
When I start talking to you in my sleep
Oh, I can be honest when I think it's a dream
I can make promises sober I'll never keep
And you can believe me as long as you want
There's nothing inside of here but blood and guts

[Verse 2]
When I hit the bottom, start pulling up floorboards
Whatever I get always need just a little bit more
So I'm catching a ride now to get on the first flight
You told me it scares you, the way that I was tonight

[Verse 3]
Oh, I miss when I was certain about every little thing
So scared of forgetting that I put it down in ink
Used to call upon the Spirit, now I think heaven lets it ring
Wanted so bad to be good, but there's no such thing

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental]

Sitting all alone again
Here I find myself alone again
But I don't know what it is
Do I push people away or am I, shy
Maybe I'm shy

Sitting all by myself
All I've got, is me and my good health
But I want more, something real
That'll feel like more than run of the mill
Run of the mill

Oooooooooo
Oooooooooo

Sitting all alone again
Here I find myself alone again
But I don't know, what it is
Do I push people away or am I shy?
Maybe I'm shy
Sitting all by myself
All I've got, is me and my good health
But I want more, something real
That'll feel like more than run of the mill

Oooooooooo
Oooooooooo
Woahhh

Too many opps, I don't know who to kill first
Young nigga rich, but you know that I still work
Fuckin' this bitch, then I'm hittin' her sister (Done)
Julio, we got liquor
Big Backwood, I ain't smokin' on swishers
He say that I hit, I don't even remember (Oh, yeah, ad)
I'm catchin' a opp and he get hit with a switcher
I walk out the store, they takin' my pictures
I'm sayin' a word, they comin' to get you
Look at my neck, it's froze like December
I came from the bottom, just me and my niggas
They free all my niggas, they out of the cell
I heard you be ridin' through the city with 12
Boom, I got the shell
I got that shit and it come out thе shelf
I'm fuckin' his bitch and I think that he mad
Masked up, bitch, I'm rеady to kick in your door
Boom, nigga, get on the floor
If the party ain't lit, nigga, I gotta go
I'ma air this bitch out if a nigga want smoke
She say she want throat, bitch, then put it in her throat
I'ma send some shots and then send a lil' more
Big Backwood, nigga smokin' gelato
Yeah, all of my opps, they be runnin', they hidin'
Jump on the jet and I land in Hawaii
Pop at the opps, nigga, you know how they fightin'
Send your location, you know that we slide
Copped a new baby, I need a new ride
Lookin' for red and they send 'em the time
Sneak diss on my name, now you gotta die

[Verse 1 Frank Ocean]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld

12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)

Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull

Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis

That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)

Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all
I see both sides like chanel, i see on both sides like chanel

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimmin' laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld

12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull

[Verse 2 Sose Paez]
Yeah yeah aye

Fighting and loving is just this life


Im sorry, im sorry said we all the same
I said we all the same, said we all the same yeah yeah, i said we all the same


Boy stop talking that bullshit

Girl why you fake you are trashing no

Energy going insane on my own
Fuck all the wars, we are in love

Bo! Been talking a lot

[Verse 1 Frank Ocean]
My guy pretty like a girl

Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull

Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)

2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis

That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)

Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all
I see both sides like chanel, i see on both sides like chanel

[Verse 3 Frank Ocean]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it drivin' itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Verse 1]
One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
One of many

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
And don't pretend, that i won't sit still, gonna show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Verse 2]
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to mе
I want you to myself
No, I won't be, won't be onе
Won't be one, one of many

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
And don't pretend, that i won't sit still, gonna show ya

(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Bridge]
(And gonna) Keep you close, next to me, I won't let you go
(You're gonna) Reminisce that you once met a girl like this

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
If I want ya, that kind of woman
And don't pretend, that i won't sit still, gonna show ya
That kind of woman
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer

[Intro segment]
Fellas – you feel like singing a chorus with me?
(The band cheer in agreement.)
There's enthusiasm for you. Hey look, I'll give you a rough idea how it goes. It starts off with me going like this: one, two, a-one, two, three, four...

(Harris' wobble board starts playing.)

And you come in in E, Paul
That's it. And then altogether, fellas...
That's nice, haha!

[Spoken song-intro section]
There's an old Australian stockman, lying, dying...
Ahh...
And he gets himself up onto one elbow
And he turns to his four mates who are gathered 'round
And he says:

[Verse 1]
Cut your hair once a year, boys
Cut your hair once a year
If it covers your ear you can't hear, boys
So cut your hair once a year
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
(You must do that "oooh!" bit...)
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)

[Spoken bridge]
Ha, ha, ha! Dear, oh dear... I've forgetten the words now
Take care of me, make sure, look out after me...
Keep goin'...
(Laughter)
(Oooh!)

(Paul McCartney:) Take care, look after me, 

[inaudible]

I'll go again...

[Verse 2]
Don't ill treat me pet dingo, Ringo
Don't ill treat me pet dingo!
(Sung in a Liverpudlian accent:)They can't understand your lingo, Ringo...
So don't ill treat me pet dingo
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

[Verse 3]
I think George's guitar's on the blink – I think
George's guitar's on the blink
It shouldn't go mm-nnga-mm-nnga, plink!
Hey, hey – that's really on the blink!
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down

[Verse 4]
Prop me up by the wall, Paul
Prop me up by the wall
I'll scream and cheer 'til I fall, Paul
If you'll prop me up by the wall...
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
(That's where it should be – there: "oooh!")
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)

[Verse 5]
Hey, keep the hits coming on John
Keep the hits coming on (oooh!)
At least 'til after I'm gone, John
Keep the hits coming on
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
(I got it!)
Tie me kangaroo down

Give us a bit of did-i-did-i-did-i...
That's it...

[Verse 6]
And with his very last gasp he says:
Tan me hide when death comes, chums
(Rolf coughs a few times) Oh dear...
Tan me hide when death comes
So we tanned his hide when he died, Clyde
And Ringo's got it on his drums!
All together now!

[Chorus]
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down (oooh!)
Tie me kangaroo down, sport
Tie me kangaroo down!

[Outro segment]
(Laughter)
What a phony bunch of laughter that was. What about messing up that ending after all the rehearsal we did? At least once
(John Lennon): You forgot the words didn't you Rolf?
At the beginning...

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, um
Hahaha, hahaha
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
It's eight-thirty in the morning
I wake up in my bed laying next to a naked woman whose name I forget
I live in a fictional unpredictable digital matrix
Lifted and faded, I been on vacation too long
I'm in the whip with the radio on
Catch my second wind, hurricane, tornado is strong
Most of you just don't understand it but you playing along
I'm at the crib rolling up with WrestleMania on
Tracy McGrady with the long ball
Every night is crazy, neighbors angry, so the cops called
Got you stuck, car stalled
Danger with the lightsaber, motherfucking Darth Maul
You playing hard ball, don't mean to alarm y'all with the freshness

[Chorus: Tay Walker & Mac Miller]
Fly me to the moon (Yeah)
Take mе over there
Fly mе to the moon
Take me over there
One step at a time
I just need something that will get me high
I wanna go up (Up, up, up)
Fly me to the moon
Won't you just fly me to the moon?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
It's eight-thirty in the morning
I used to want to be Jordan
Or Cassius Clay when he was knocking out Foreman
Maybe live in a building that got a doorman
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant
Yeah, history in the making
Bitter-sweet epiphanies (Get friendly with Satan)
Temptations too tempting
One man symphony, fresher than some Listerine
Been a beast, these rappers sweeter than a Krispy Kreme
Bars on guillotine, I'm a motherfucking wildebeest
Mr. Clean, catch me out in Italy
Obscenity, profanity, baby
Why you gotta be so shady?

[Chorus: Tay Walker]
One step at a time
I just need something that will get me high
I wanna go up
Fly me to the moon
Won't you just fly me to the moon? (Take me there)
Fly me to the moon with you
Fly me to the moon, yeah (Fly me)
Fly me to the moon with you (Just fly me)
Take me over there
Fly me to the moon (Just fly me)
Take me over there

[Outro: Tay Walker]
Just fly
Fly me
Just fly

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Holly Humberstone]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can’t make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1: Dave Bayley & Holly Humberstone, both]
Usually I put somethin’ on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, thе night has come, but

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Holly Humberstone]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Latе nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2: Dave Bayley]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin’ so lovin’, but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don’t wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Holly Humberstone]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin’ me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge: Dave Bayley & Holly Humberstone]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Holly Humberstone]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Peanut butter jelly sandwiches are made with love
In the shape of a heart
Driving twelve hours just to kiss my face
In my arms on my birthday, yeah

[Chorus]
This must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, hey
When they talk about love

[Verse 2]
Messed up hair and I don't mind
"Come here, baby" kisses are my favorite kind
Don’t forget to call when you wake up
A little еxtra sugar in my coffee cup

[Chorus]
Yeah, this must be what they mеan when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, hey
When they talk about love

[Bridge]
They must be talking about the way we look at me
Oh-oh
I bet that they were wishing they were you and me
Yeah

[Chorus]
This must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, hey
When they talk about
This must be what they mean when they talk about love
Hey, I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, yeah

[Break]
When they talk about love
When they talk about love
I finally get it
This must be what they mean, must be talking about us, yeah, hey
When they talk about love

[Outro]
Messed up hair and I don't mind
"Come here, baby" kisses are my favorite kind
Don't forget to call when you wake up
A little extra sugar in my coffee cup

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, you know it
Mmm, this the remix
Doja, rrr

[Chorus: Doja cat & Nicki minaj]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let u had i known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Uh)

[Verse 1: Nicki minaj]
Every time i take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spitten' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the Rams, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, i'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, i'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yеs, i'm ghetto, word to Geppetto
Plus i'm littlе, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now i'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but i made him more a fiend
Ever since i put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee

[Chorus: Doja cat & Makayla]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had i known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Doja cat]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why i got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beatin' round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating i have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus: Doja cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had i known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Post-Chorus: Nicki minaj]
Yeah, you know it

[Outro: Nicki minaj]
You coulda said so
Boy, you shoulda said so
Say so, say so
I got dressed just to sit in the house
People with the least always doin' the most
I'm countin' money while he suckin' my toes
Real nasty with them balls, all net, yeah, i'm gross
Why you talkin' 'bout who body fake?
With all them fillers in your face, you just full of hate
That real ass ain't keep your nigga home
Now you lookin' silly that's word to silicone

[Verse 1]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

[Chorus]
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

[Post-Chorus]
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes

[Verse 2]
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

[Chorus]
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

[Post-Chorus]
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

[Chorus]
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

[Post-Chorus]
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh

Everybody say hello to Space Cowboy please!
How you doin'? Oh, oh, oh
This song is called Egyptian Lover!

[Verse 1: Space Cowboy & Lady Gaga]
I see your boy, but he don't do it like me
He's not that type, I see it in your eyes
You need a freak, someone to keep a secret
A boy like me who knows what's on your mind
You make it hot, I see you looking at me
Stop wasting time and come with me tonight
Stop spending money on me, stop wasting time
If you're coming home with me you're running out of time

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Space Cowboy & Nadia Oh]
My Egyptian, my Egyptian lover
There is no other (There is no other)
My Egyptian lover, my Egyptian lover, my Egyptian lover
There is no other (There is no other)

Heaven, help me

JENESIS
Haha
What's up, everybody, it's the kid Mac Miller
You're now rockin' with the best DJ in the whole goddamn world
DJ Bonics, motherfucker
Shoutout JENESIS Magazine, much love, thumbs up
Uh
Let me put the pad down

[Chorus]
Let's get away, I'ma let you see
If you can stay, I'ma set you free
They know my name, and my face
Give me praise, give 'em dates
But these dreams are just make-believe
Why don't you see the world from my eyes? (Haha)
Can you see the world from my eyes? (We got somethin' right here, boy)
This is me, no lies, my life, no disguise (Look)
See the world from my eyes

[Verse 1]
It take a little bit of medicine to start the day
Spark the haze, take a shower, brush my teeth, wash my face
Ready to go out in the world all alone
As I 

[?] bitches blowin' up my phone
She a ho, so no, I ain't hittin' that
She wanna get with Mac just to see her friends react-ion
Say she love me 'cause I'm rappin'
Only care about the money, superstardom and the fashion
It's just me, it ain't black and white
Any muhfucker, any color, he ain't half as nice
They say I'm rappin' like JAY-Z or rappin' like Wiz
But you cryin' like a baby and you actin' like a kid
Hittin' parties, rollin' up into the crib
What it is? Shit, I'm just tryna live, do it big
I got Pittsburgh behind this
Why don't you take a little look through my eye-lids?

[Chorus]
Let's get away, I'ma let you see
If you can stay, I'ma set you free
They know my name, and my face
Give me praise, give 'em dates
But these dreams are just make-believe
Why don't you see the world from my eyes?
Can you see the world from my eyes?
This is me, no lies, my life, no disguise (Hey, hey)
See the world from my eyes (Hey, look, yeah, uh)

[Verse 2]
I learned quick that you can't trust no one
Mo' money, mo' problems, it's no fun
I live a life far away from the normal kid
Travel down the road to success and the purpose is
To get some money, cop my momma a Benz
I'm livin' the dream, but for all y'all, it's pretend, ha
A lotta women, lotta weed, and a lotta shows
If you ain't loyal to the goal, then you gotta go
It's Most Dope, thought you oughta know
That's my family, my peoples, my army, bro
See, my life may seem so "Wow" good
But I'm grindin' and missin' all my childhood
I keep a smile, can't show it in distress
A glass of Henny and a empty bag of cigarettes
I deal with problems my own way and most hate
Shouts to Jeffy, Jerm, Wizzle and Boabay
Those my mentors, showed me how to get the cash
And this money told me how to smack a stripper's ass, haha
That's my life, boy, I have a ball
Get your final drink in, it's last call

[Chorus]
Let's get away, I'ma let you see
If you can stay, I'ma set you free
They know my name, and my face
Give me praise, give 'em dates
But these dreams are just make-believe
Why don't you see the world from my eyes?
Can you see the world from my eyes?
This is me, no lies, my life, no disguise
See the world from my eyes

If you really got some pressure, nigga, say somethin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All my life I put love last like Faizon
Free all of my niggas locked up like Akon

[Verse 1]
I be on bullshit, I need revenge, gotta step on somethin' (Step)
She not talking pregnancy when she said she do baby bumps
Eighty different sticks up in my house, so that's like eighty drums
I been hanging 'round Bloods my whole life, so fuck it, make me one (Brrt)
Making two-four-five, going double profit
Yeah, Lil Boat, bitch, I'm known to make it catastrophic
By the way, every bitch a squirter just like how'd I work the faucet? (Damn)
I'm done with all these bitches, I got the gold, I'm off the market, yeah

[Verse 2]
We ain't never won shit before now
I ain't ever left my gun in the house
Nigga try some funny shit, it's going south (On God)
Say the wrong thing, my nigga runnin' in your mouth
Niggas shouldn't even speak on swag
I'm the quicker picker upper like a Bounty's ad
You niggas act like us, lil' boy, get it through your head
I'm not Jordan Carter, nigga, but I sip a whole lot of (Blatt)

All my life I put love last like Faizon
Free all of my niggas locked up like Akon

[Chorus]
She said she love me, I know it's a lie
So I pour me a cup, throw it up to the sky
But her jealousy, see it all in her eyes
But they envy me, I'm not here for the talk
They said that they love me, I know it's a lie
Yeah, I was down better, I was broke, oh my God
But they envy me, so I gotta be cautious
But that jealousy, it was never your time, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Shawty fell in love with this lifestyle
Heard she fell in love with the sights, no
Heard she for my love for the night, night
Still no talkin' bout it, supposed to pipe down

[Intro: Drake]
(Six)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out "YOLO," yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
I pray these niggas understand how passionate the tale is
To get you under my pressure
Richer
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count monеy all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Tеddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

[Break]
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
"The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino"
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)

[Outro]
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, you can say what you want but ain't been in my shoes (Uh-huh)
Don’t tell me how it feels, you don't know what I been through (Oh, oh, oh)
I've seen a lot of shit in my life, I ain’t never choose (I didn't)
I put the money over everything, I never lose (I never, I never ever)

[Chorus]
Sometimes in life you gotta do shit that you don't wanna do (You don't)
I learned that shit when I was young
And that's what helped me through (Helped me through)
I saw my closest people end up dead on the news (Okay)
She told me that my heart so cold (Yeah), yeah that's what hell will do (That's what hell will do)

[Verse]
Yeah I was forced into this lifestyle (Oh, oh), did what I had to do or it would have been lights out
I was at the lowest point of my life I was right down

[Open Verse]

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, "What if?", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

[Verse 3: SZA]
Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (Exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (All this ass)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

[Chorus: Doja Cat, SZA & Both]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh
Oh, darlin'

[Post-Chorus: SZA & Doja Cat]
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 3]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you're frozen
You're frozen

Yo, this one goes out to my boy 

[?]
On that hip-hop shit
Let's do it, Rec

[Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Listen, what's the matter when you know it all?
(What's the matter with ya?)
You wanna pull a Shawshank freedom from your brain's wall
So you tell a story, a story of exodus
When you skip the pain, and looked up for happiness
(Yeah, look, look, yo, look, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
First breath and I'm into this Earth
The doctor knew it was spiritual, a miracle birth
I learned to speak immediately, fiddle with words
Get on my nerves, materials I didn't deserve
And from the first time I could catch a breath
I'd lay in bed, writin' poems on my Etch-A-Sketch
I'd sеt my steps up, climbin', I was straight to the top
An exodus, madе for the mic, and makin' it rock, yeah
This hip-hop could be heard from six blocks
I was raisin' the roof and just breakin' it off
'Cause before that I could ever walk or stand
My mom was bustin' hip-hop through the sonogram
So it seems only right to just bump it up
Hit this dick of a planet with a nickel bag of funk, yeah
A nickel bag of funk, a nickel bag of funk
Hit this dick of a planet with just a nickel bag of funk

[Chorus: John Record]
What's the matter when you know it all?
(What's the matter with ya?)
You wanna pull the Shawshank freedom from your brain's wall
So you tell a story, a story of exodus
When you skip the pain, and looked up for happiness

[Post-Chorus: John Record & Mac Miller]
Start lookin' up
Start lookin' up (Yeah, look, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm lookin' up, my mind's above the clouds
For those who run they mouth, they ain't know what I'm about
What is now is the present, a gift, I'll leave it wrapped
My days are passin', my words are overlappin'
Hip-hop's a saga, get told with a lot a ganja
We sparked the marijuana, breathe deep
I'm not 

[?] God's offer 

[?] flowin' water
Grow that shit, roll that shit, smoke that shit
Saga continues, hip-hop is not an issue
I ain't got a tissue I could give you, ain't nobody with you
Battle mano a mano, no crowd, no audience
I'm not convinced that you have the confidence to talk some shit
I'm ominous, definition cadence, all-knowin'
I'm always kickin' it, spittin' whatever you call flow
I flow so much, my book erupts
My days are gone, I continue lookin' up

[Chorus: John Record]
What's the matter when you know it all?
(What's the matter with ya?)
You wanna pull a Shawshank freedom from your brain's wall
So you tell a story, a story of exodus
When you skip the pain, and looked up for happiness

[Post-Chorus: John Record]
Start lookin' up
Start lookin' up

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen
Some people lose everything
First to go is their mind
Responsibility
To me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time

I want to join a band
And play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation Give me the melody
That's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

[Chorus]
We're lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up!)
No turnin' back (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We're lost in music

[Outro]
We're lost in music

I put the baguettes in the front of the earrings in front of the

Let 'em come in the lobby, I'll kill 'em with violence

I put on my tribe, let's go, couple million and rise, let's go

I'm sippin' codeine and I keep it on rocks
I'm rockin' the rocks full of rocks
I'm parking the yacht by the lot

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Intro]
Haha (The what? The what? The what? The what?)
Y'all know what it is (The what? The what?)
The Jukebox (The what? The what?)
Uh

[Verse]
I come with lil' bit more swagger with 

[?] (Chyeah)
Haters put they lips up on my ass like I was Jadakiss (Uh-huh)
Looney like Goofy is (Goofy is), and spittin' Ludacris
Bars that can move a bitch from Hollywood to Budapest

[?] I'm stupid fresh, lookin' like a bar of soap (Bar of soap)
Spittin' writtens at these women and that's all she wrote (Aw, what's up, baby?)
Remarkable aim, I'm targetin' lames
Removin' parts of they brain with this logical slang
Awaken, always on my grind, sleep is callin' my name
But a couple extra innings always follow the game ('Cause, 'causе, 'cause)
It's 'cause I'm workin' overtimе, smokin' that potent, I'm
Glowin' with shine like in the mornin' when you open blinds
Hold the commotion, I'm holdin' dough and the flow
Like Coke on a stove, growin' my dough, rollin' with mo'
And we ain't speakin' business if it's over the phone
You might as well invite the po' to your home, dummy (Dummy)
For the money, better be smart (Be smart)
And you's a retard (Retard)
Givin' your girl a credit card's like a free mall
That'll get you MC Hammer'd, I'ma tell you twice
End up in reality shows like you Vanilla Ice (Haha)
I live a stellar life (Uh-huh)
Sellin' kryptonite to stupid lil' kids who like to smoke but never get that nice

[?] Have no fear, ladies and gentlemen of planet Earth, Mac is here

[Verse 1]
Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

[Verse 3]
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

[Bridge]
You said, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

[Outro]
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make surе you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to bе here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

[Outro]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?

[Verse 1]
I want to be wild and young
And not be afraid to lose
Cry on my own, me and my bottle
These are the things I choose

[Chorus]
But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see that all I wanna do
Is get a little wild, get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong, I'm young

[Verse 2]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I wanna fight and fall off the tables
Then wait to regret last night
My heavy heart pounds deep like a dagger
'Cause I'm not afraid to bite

[Chorus]
But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see that all I wanna do
Is get a little wild, get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong, I'm young

[Outro]
Get a little wild, get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong, I'm young

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds

[Verse 1]
Have it all, rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothin' to me anymore
But to you, they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be

Always me that pays the cost
I should never trust so easily
You lied to me, lie-lied to me
Then left with my heart 'round your chest (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My heart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How little I care, how little I care

[Chorus]

I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)

We're gonna turn Abbey Road into a gay bar right now
Let's go
(You're everything tonight)

[Verse 1]
Are you drunk enough
Not to judge what I'm doin'?
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined?
'Cause I'm ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, hmmm

[Chorus]
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I’m a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
’Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I’m way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you’re thinkin' I’m heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I’m just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

Ahhh

I'm way too good at goodbyes

[Intro: Jade Anouka]
This is where we belong
Stood in an empty space
The centre
You are my core
An oasis in the middle of a storm we created
This vessel, empty
Space filled with nothing but longing and hope
You left me with ache
But I am magic
You left me in pain
But in my oasis there is space to dream again
Oh, I have suffered to with those that I saw suffer
Not a hair perished, that may be true
But my mind perishes without the possibility of you

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
Keep thinkin' that I'm seein' water
You're playing tricks on me in the sun
See your shadow in the courtyard
Stays until the day is done
The desert don't end, the rain don't fall
And I can't pretend I don't want you all
'Cause I want you all
You all, you all, you all

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you)
My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (Free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (Emotions)
I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean)
I pray for your devotion (Devotion)
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Verse 2: Jade Anouka]
Stuck inside with me
The turn
But I need you
We do
This is a space for all
We yearn
Not for back to how it was
But for a future atypical and new
We've been closed for so long
Let's open the view

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you, oh, baby)
My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (Free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (Emotions)
I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean)
I pray for your devotion (Devotion)
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Give it up for Jade
Everyone
You're wonderful

[Verse 1]
I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me, how do you—)
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me, how do you—)

[Verse 2]
Oh, no, how did I managе to lose me?
I am not this despеrate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what I have done (Done)
Diallin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me how do you—)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)
Oh, love will keep you up tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (Oh)
All that fear and all that pressure (Oh)
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)

[Verse 1]
Think about your lips and the way they kiss
There's so much I really miss about you
Sitting on the beach, you were still in reach
And I haven't felt free without you

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, was tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

[Chorus]
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them therе for you, mmm

[Verse 2]
You've been on my mind every singlе night
I can't visualize life without you
I've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep
But there's something that I need to go through

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, was tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

[Chorus]
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
All those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
All those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you

[Verse 1]
Can't believe I still avoid the East Side
Even though I know that you don't live there now
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I can't stop my self on drivin' by your house

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somеbody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll nеver be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Verse 2]
Livin' out of suitcases in hotels
Drinking way too much and talking through the night
Really wish I didn't know you so well
Wouldn't be so hard to leave the past behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Bridge]
Mmm, mmm
No, I, I, I, I
I'm, I'm
Mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Intro: Mac Miller]
It's real late on a Saturday night
Take you on a ride real quick, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Let's take a stroll down the road of hip-hop in the past (Yup)
Don't miss a rap, need to listen when I'm in the class
Grab a (What?) pen and a pad (Yeah), and then I get mad
Hip-hop and I got history, we ended it bad
See, I was friends with her dad (What?)
The jazz, funky, soul shit
As I gave birth, I realized I can't control Ms. Needy (Nope)
I'm askin' all these MC's to feed me
'Cause hip-hop took my life and money, bitch is greedy

[Chorus: Mac Miller & John Record]
Why you after me?
And the game say, "Slow down, youngin," and you say
I gotta get away
Yeah, and then that man said to flow downtown, and you say
Fuck you, right?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I remember savin' quarters just to get a tape recorder
I'm abstract, see, I seem to run away from borders
I ain't tryna be a slave to order, I'm movin' forward
Mary Jane my girl, so I gotta make some paper for her
My name is sorta cheesy but I do mack easy
It's a quick-serve meal with all these rappers that they feed me
For energy, money makin', melody rich
Gettin' green like a bundle of some celery sticks
I'm losin' my mind, payin' for my studio time
Yeah, the white kid on the corner, dog, who knew he could rhyme?
They wonder what's influencin' my music that I make
My mind stay never lettin' time wait
I lie straight, and smoke heavily, got no memory
Words I wrote cleverly over these dope melodies
I'ma keep spittin' 'til I least broke seventy
And you could find me smokin' L's with the elderly

[Chorus: Mac Miller & John Record]
Why you after me?
And the game say, "Slow down, youngin," and you say
Yeah, and then that man said to flow downtown, and you say

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen (Haha)
Y'all know who I am (Yessir)
As y'all await The High Life (What?)
I bring you (What?)
Just a preview of what's comin' (Haha)
Some of the finest bars in the world (Haha)
They wonder who I am (Tell 'em, haha)

[Verse]
I am whatever you wish you was (Wish you was)
Listen up, 'cause I'm comin' with some different stuff (Different stuff)
Fuck, call it innovative, they call it switchin' up
Muhfuckers need to hop up off the dick and nuts (Uh-huh)
And you can blame on the way that I roll (I roll)
Or that the boy too high to control (Control)
Go on and hate it if you wanna (What?)
'Cause I keep gettin' hotter (Uh-huh)
Comin' right outta the soul
I make (I make) that good music, no Kanye (No Kanye)
See me bob my head walkin' down the hallway  (Walkin' down the hallway)
Just smilin', everything is all great (Haha)
It's in my hands, I'm goin' Allstate (What?)
But not a superstar, I'm just tryna move ya heart
Stressed out, ashes scattered all through the car
Kept goin' from the time that I started (Yup)
Haven't stopped to even use the stall (Nah)
But now I see my posters hangin' through the mall
Tryna get this paper done I got due tomorrow (Haha)
See, I'm not a rapper, how they usually are (Nah)
'Cause my music 

[?] (Yeah), I'm goin' stupid hard (Uh-huh)
I drive a Beamer (Drive a Beamer), it's my dad's though (Haha)
Roll around, bumpin' music like a asshole (Asshole)
But I got some bad hoes in the back row (What up?)
Some lil' groupies, get they number at the last show (Yessir)
A lot of people wonder what I rap for (Why?)
Try and diss me, I ain't spittin' back though (Hell nah)
I don't need to, what I gotta prove? (Nothin')
I ain't got the time, there's some stuff I gotta do (Yup)
I be kickin' rhymes, lunch table with the crew
Had a whole cafeteria like, "Ooh!"
Random dudes comin' up to say hello (What up?)
"When ya mixtape droppin'? When's ya next show?" (Pssh)
Well, I don't know, I just do this
This can be your life if you choose it

[Verse 1]
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl...
She thinks she's something in this world."
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, therе's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thundеr
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say "go"
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

[Bridge]
Go ahead and don't believe
Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Chorus]
No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop-

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own

[Hook: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I’m from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story – money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I’m, stickin’, to it (x8)

[Verse: R. Kelly]
Kells where you been?
In the kitchen, cookin bricks
Yea I know the haters missed me so I’m back up in this bitch
And I’m laughin all the way to the bank (ah ah ah ah)
Got yo chick all on my dick like (ah ah ah ah)
My story ain’t changed homie
At the date homie
I do this shit for the Chi homie
And I love a bad bitch that’ll wind for me
Get up in that pussy, make it cry for me
What do yall know about walking the streets?
Going 4 or 5 days without nothing to eat
To the foreign Ferraris, reclining the seats
To the top of thе world where the living is sweet
God damn, call mе Mr. 12Play
Fuck you 12 hunned ways
Realest nigga to the grave

[Hook: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I’m from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts

This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I’m, stickin’, to it (x8)

[Verse: Too $hort]
When I first came in the game
They said I couldn’t rap
I would never sell records with a mouth like that
But year after year
I got them platinum plaques
The first rapper of the bay stackin racks on racks
Now aks yo favorite rapper how he feels about Too $hort
I’ve been balling so long I need my own hood court
Got 2 songs with Pac, 3 songs with BIG
4 songs with Jay-Z, Pimp C and Tip
Aks the ATL
If I did these things
I helped pioneer the scene and bought that Cali green
That’s my story, I’m sticking to it
I’d never switch
And it wouldn’t be me if I didn’t say “bitch!”

[Hook: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I’m from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story – money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I’m, stickin’, to it (x8)

[Verse: Nipsey Hussle]
Yea, nah
I can tell you bout
No elevators, what the stairs is bout
No scared money, took the fearless route
Them 10 thousand dollars that yo years is bout
Still proud what I look at in the mirror bro
16, couple things, tryna mail em south
Wishin on a star, what the man’s about
Catches them cases and bailing out
And most of these niggas took the failure route
I had the nerve to believe in this world of doubt
The nerve to achieve, I prepared myself
When niggas plant seeds and they rarely sprout
And niggas had dreams what they really bout
The process nigga, rather chill on the couch
I was going hard on the measly slouts
I been payin dues, this is clearly clout
World on my shoulder, I can curl yo house
I done everything and I still got out
And what I went through, niggas woulda killed theyself
And when it don’t cross mind I reveal myself
Blood, sweat & tears what I spilled myself
Well fuck you nigga cuz I feel myself
Don’t co-sign, I was real myself
You gotta put me with niggas that done build theyself
Hussle

[Hook: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I’m from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story – money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I’m, stickin’, to it (x8)

[Intro]
Sour Hour
DJ Shef
Man, I hit the weed way too much, shit, let me get to the song
A lotta y'all probably know this
Had to put my own little twist on it
Ahem
Aight, Jerm, ya ready?

[Verse]
Uh
Well, it's the motherfuckin' M to the A-C, M to the I
Double-L, E-R, fallin' from the sky 'til I land
Crash into this planet, skippin' through the universe, I vanish
And disappear, wise beyond my years
Ridin' through the streets but too high to even steer, so I hover
Three hundred feet from the ground
And I don't plan on comin' down
You run around like a chicken with his head cut off
I'm havin' chickens, give me head, no special 

[?]
I'm on my pimp shit, swimmin' through 

[?]
Let a thick bitch give me brains, watch a chick-flick
Somethin' About Mary, nut in her hair
Her mom hear us, but I don't give a fuck if she there
Learned that life's a bitch, and nothin' is fair
So I focus on my money, get enough I can share
And get me drunk, I don't care, I pass the money to my team
'Cause they all be by my side while I'm huntin' for this dream
Nothin' what it seem in a dreamland
And I ain't growin' up, call me Peter Pan
Givin' you the news like C-SPAN
Tryna ball, ESPN, and
Haha, I'm way over my limit
Cracked a Dutchie down the middle, throw some haze in it
I'm gone, and I might be back to visit
Add a ho, subtract the clothes, Mac the mathematician, haha
So what the fun in that?
When my liver shriveled up and my lungs is black
But, livin' free, I ain't done with that
'Cause I'ma keep chiefin' 'til my lungs collapse, ayy
So what's the matter with that? Uh
What's the matter with that?
And everybody boyfriend is a sissy, so the bitches heard she kiss me
She wanna stick around like a hickey but I'm busy
Just makin' music, hittin' sticky 'cause it lift me
Bitch, I got more talents than the homie Mr. Ripley
As a youngin, knew that hip-hop was in me
At fifteen, dropped a mixtape and it was iffy
Worked to get better, took my time when I was sixteen
So now you say my name at any party and you in free
Still a youngin, in discussion like a grown man
Lil' munchkins got a hunch that I'm a gold ham
I'ma blow, damn, time to be my own man
Bunch of fine hoes chillin', feelin' up the whole van
I don't fuck 'em just 'cause they supportin' me, hell
It's no biggy, they just lookin' for a story to tell
No groupie gettin' glory, ain't doin' nothin' for me
That's why I never let 'em stay the morning
I just open up my eyes when I wake, and I bake
On my grind, stayin' scruffy, never shavin' my face
A lotta time on my hands, never takin' a break
'Cause Sheffy hit me up with some paper to make
I'ma take my time, grind until the day I die
My weed the flavor lime, gettin' high, chase the sky
You see the paper 

[?] shit
So please, keep your distance like an eighth grade dance, bitch

[Outro]
Hahaha, chyeah
See, man, sometimes I just like to
Just spit, haha
Crumblin' Erb and shit
Big Jerm, you can cut that, uh, right about... here

Stayin out nights with the ballers
If you a creep you get right with the crawlers (Hmmm)

You in the shorts they letting niggas dog ya {Oh}
And that's a fact
I took a rich nigga bitch then I passed her back
We just did a couple shots blew half a sack
Think about it all the time ‘cause her ass was fat {Yeah}
Got you open like a kid in the candy store
Or you stay away from it they just hand you more
They don't own that life, you'll understand me more
You just need to know that her pussy can’t be yours
SUCKA!

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby, show me something

And it's all for nothing (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me see)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

The days run on till we go back
This sorry place has shown me that
Although the sky is full of fire
The flames go higher and higher

[Chorus]
America, America
Where have I gone?
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
If you see Annie, tell her I will
By her windows on the hill
Water flowers on the sill
Till they grow higher and higher

[Chorus]
America, America
Where have I gone?
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home

[Verse 1]
Wake up, it's a Monday morning
No time left to say goodbye
Can't breathe and the lights are changing

[Chorus]
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
Headlights make it home by sundown
Feelin' that the day is through
Return back to where you come from

[Chorus]
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughin'
Oh no, oh no

[Verse]
Well, it's a mothеrfuckin' Mac comin' back with the A-team
Just waiting, sittin' in a daydream (What?), laying on a hammock
Tryna rеlax, goddammit
Not tryna hear your panic, antics
Am sicker than the chicken-pox when I rock (Rock)
Still spittin' everything, they hot, leave 'em shocked (Shocked)
Like they just seen a ghost or somethin'
The oldest youngin with a dope flow, it's nothin' (Haha)
I look pretty average, spit way above that
People holla when they see me, say, "What's up, Mac?" (What up?)
Young crap, I ain't tryna touch that
Dumbass cops here, fuck that, always wanna cuff Mac
Run tracks and I'm done fast (Done fast)
Got you right under my nose like a mustache
Y'all rodents, muskrats, stuck like a thumb tack
Foot tap, you could see me up where the funk at (Haha)
Take a little time, come and check the rhyme
And this just some lyrical exercise
Tryna stay in shape like a polygon, it's on
Hoes stay obsessed, always call me when I'm gone
"Can you come over?", "I'm busy, it's important"
"What could you be doin' at five in the mornin'?"
"Um, um, recordin', doin' shit for Class Clown"
"Well, who is that girl in the background?"
"Haha, you caught me, I guess you got me"
I just can't keep 'em off me, they somethin' like the paparazzi
Goin' for the kill like a kamikaze (Haha)
No clothes ever on her body, haha
Your whole team gotten on her probably
She always seem like she on the molly
But, hey, I'm just a boy, I'm sorry

[Outro]
What? What?

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong (Bang the gong)
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?" (Is it wrong?)
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear (I bear, bear)
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]

Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Make it real loud
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, t- (Put your hands up)

[Verse 1]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I lovе (I'll turn the lights out)

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

[Verse 2]
I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

[Outro: Flo Rida]

[Verse 1]
Once again, I'm slipping into my feminine ways
Pump creatine and skip leg day
Jump as four titans emerge from underground
Debating, "Would you rather be burnt or drowned?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Pump fists, drunk on the stench of fraternity
Haloed by memories of benching eternity
Head polished to a mirror for Athena
Goodbye, Nana A and stay strong, Nana Tina

[Chorus]
Before the America's Cup
It was sailors and junkies
Pescatores and bikies
Before the America's Cup
Never heard of methadone
Never called the shelter home
Never went to bed alone
Alan was a rolling stone
Uh-huh (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Once again, I'm slipping up to my hominid gait
Kiss soil, crack vertebrate
I'm cocksure as a man jumping off a cliff
Top-heavy head, cigarette and a quiff

[Pre-Chorus]
Slunk back drunk to the den of uncertainty
Crying a fantasy of bleeding maternity

[Chorus]
Before the America's Cup
It was sailors and junkies
Pescatores and bikies
Before the America's Cup
Never heard of methadone
Never called the shelter home
Never went to bed alone
Alan was a rolling stone
Uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tip-toe, going on some gospel
Oh oh, sea air, join a ship in Minsk
The way I see it, don't care in Tex
Ocean Network Express

[Outro]
Before the America's Cup
It was sailors and junkies
Pescatores and bikies
Before the America's Cup
Never heard of methadone
Never called the shelter home

Pescatores and bikies
Before the America's Cup
Never heard of methadone
Never called the shelter home
Before the America's Cup
It was sailors and junkies
Pescatores and bikies

Lyrics from Snippet

[...] generation to come
I gotta go get a home for my mom
Gold on me now, got me shining like a stone
They went with the star feeling 'fore I was born
Don't go with me

You got every nigga in the city fuckin' with you now
They ain't really with you, wanna take you down
I thought you held me down, thought I had somebody that could hold me down
Yeah, word get around
Heard you had another nigga in the town
Heard you let another nigga wear the crown
See you goin' up, I ain't goin' down, play around, uh
Niggas always talkin' 'bout the sound
Your man wanna be like me
Bitches always wanna fuck around
See you lookin' lonely
Gas, even I would pull up on me

Wildin', losing focus off of what I really want
They don't get me, I been working, grindin' all night long
I'm just fuckin' faded, feeling ghost, I'm fuckin' gone
I just get it, I don’t give a fuck, I ain’t got shit to lose
Now she coming back, 'cause she see me making all these moves (Uh-oh-oh)

With no hearts in the cards, but a full house
Keep tellin' me the music is too loud

Through with the bullshit, it ruin the mood
So it's deuces, onto the new shit, I move out
The movement is fluid, I moon bounce
Yeah, used to the clouds, up, up and away
Stay put, she's glued to the ground, loose
Yeah, circle tight like screws
And I don't want anything new 'cept money and a little good news
Runnin' on fumes, give me fuel, let me light my fuse
Get back, gimme, gimme room

[Intro: Mac Miller & Barry Manilow]
TreeJay presents Sour Hour
I just hit this weed, but uh, now it's like
The feelin' is gone and I must get it back right away
(Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ah damn, think I just put out my last blunt
Empty plastic bag, lookin' like I need to grab some bomb
'Cause this feelin' is gone
I'm comin' down off this high and the weekend is long
It's full of grind, so I need to get some shit to ease my mind
Call me Corona 'cause I gotta keep that lime gap pine like 

[?]
Without it, I'ma fall and break
Chingy with the sticky, my connect is just a call away
I grab the zip while we gotta smoke it all today
I should be chillin', coppin' shoes at the mall with cake
But I gotta keep workin' like an office space
Comin' after numbers, now they callin' me Deuteronomy
My weed is fuel, so I need that sour diеsel
Just called my dude, and in half an hour hе will hit me
Billy keep the flavors of the sticky
That do you like some acid, have you tripping
Yeah, you know I smoke it, ya mama probably smoke it
And I can guarantee Obama smoke it
Just hittin' L's with Michelle, shit, I think I'm sober now
Let me grab my cell and see what smokes around

[Interlude: Mac Miller, Bill The Kid & Barry Manilow]
Ayo, Bill
Yo, what's good, Mac?
Yeah, I need some weed, man, I'm out
Uh, alright, alright

The feelin' is gone and I must get it back right away
(Okay, okay, yeah, look)

[Verse 2: Bill The Kid]
I got that good weed sendin', hit this chronic smoke
Pounds to 

[?] so they send me, our closet fulls
Yeah, I'm honest, is four-forty-eight on the dot
You know I counted eighteen thou' for five of them
Been around 

[?] Swishers blowin' clouds of piff
Ounce of sour down, goin' in, you know what time it is
Thinkin' over lines, smokin', never too high to spit
Never doin' time 'cause we seem friendly in an environment
Ready to retire my early twenties, so I'm tryna spit
And get my workin' heavy so there's plenty more time to live
I can't lie, I'm livin' better, so I'll die with what I did
That's why I'm smokin' all the time with Mac Miller
So when he hits me, get my bitch up off me
Smokin' out the Civi' all night, never miss the party
Yeah, get her started on those spliffs 

[?] cigars for later
For that late-night Swisher with ya bitchy on me
And wake up to the next hit, early mornin' smokin'
Strap my Jordans, goin' to breakfast, blowin' smoke out like Vince, yeah

[Verse 1]
Chained
To the wall of our room
Yeah, you chained me like a dog in our room
I thought that's how it was
I thought that we were fine
Then the day was night
You were high
You were high when I was doomed and dying for
With no life, with no light

[Verse 2]
Tied to my bed
I was younger then
I had nothing to spend but time on you

[Refrain]
But it made me love, it made me love, it made me love more
It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more
It made me love
More

[Verse 3]
Do what you said, the words she said left out
Over into the sky where I'll soon fly
And she took the time to believe in, to believe in what she said

[Refrain]
Love more
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more
Love more
Love more (She made me love)
Love more (She made me love, she made me love)
Love more

On the computer, you come across rumors
And you come across a bunch of hatin'-ass losers
But net worth is the best worth (Yep)
Havin' boardroom meetings, no dress shirt
And when you on the road, kinda miss it like ya home
Don't worry, homie, all you do is Twitter from your phone
See these bloggers like radio DJ's
Get ready, this is hip-hop
Mixtape tracks, better play 'em on replay
My money gettin' taller than Chris Bosh
Sike, you know I'm on the Macintosh
'Cause I can't get cash from Jobs (Haha)

[Chorus]
I'm stuck at my computer, glued into my chair
On Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, this ain't fair (Haha)
House burnin' down but I don't seem to care
'Cause I'm stuck on the computer with a million things to share
I'm stuck at my computer, glued into my chair
On Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, this ain't fair
House burnin' down but I don't seem to care (Haha)
'Cause I'm stuck on the computer with a million things to share
(To share)

[Intro]
Well, fuck it

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do when your keyboard is fucked up?
And you got nothing else that you can do, and your shit is all fucked up
Bitch what the fuck you gonna do?
You gonna go to the store, buy another shit, bring that shit home, and fuck up it
Bitch you gonna pee on your keyboard, throw it at the wall whether...

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter bitch, that shit gonna break
Because they make it so that it breaks, so that you could spend more money when you buy another one
I don't give a fuck, i'm gonna play this shit until it turns to bubblegum
'Till it turns to motherfucking dust

[Chorus]
Ima, slam on that bitch, slam on that bitch
Slam, slam on that bitch
Ima slam on that bitch, 'till it turns to ass
I don't give a fuck, let me finish this song

Can't bring myself to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do?
I don't wanna feel blue

There are some who believe that I owe them something
But they're wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself
And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there...

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to privacy, but most of all
To innocence

And if you can do it better, then you're welcome to my fame
I'm not gonna waste my time correcting myths and rumors
You bеlieve what you want to beliеve
But I believe my sanity well

Say goodbye to privacy, but most of all
To innocence
To innocence
To innocence
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't need a reason to cry

Love everybody, bye

I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation

Until you watch the shadows cross the ceilin'

Come on home
Come on home
You don't have to be alone
Just come on home

Well, I can see that you can't win for tryin'
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Maria Taylor]
Come on home
Come on home
You don't have to be alone
Just come on home

[Verse 4: Phoebe Bridgers]
The moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'
I still love that picture of us walkin'
Just like that old house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wanted

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Maria Taylor]
Come on home
Come on home
No, you don't have to be alone
Just come on home
Come on home
No, you don't have to be alone
Come on home

[Verse 1: Phoebe Bridgers]
Day off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, with Jackson Browne]
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changеd my mind

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekеnd, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chemtrails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
You get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it
Twenty-five felt like flying

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, with Jackson Browne]
I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes, until it happened
Then I changed my mind

[Outro: Phoebe Bridgers & Jackson Browne]
Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
I'm a liar

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 1]
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 2]
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptinеss and memories
Of what we had bеfore
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy

You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away

Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer, it's a payment plan

[Verse 2]
There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money, and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

[Chorus]
Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name?

[Verse 3]
I asked you, "How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree."
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
You said, "What does that make me?"

[Verse 4]
I asked you, "How is playing drums?"
Said, "It's too much shit to carry"
"And what about the band?"
You said, "Thеy're all having babies"

Do you feel ashamed
Whеn you hear my name?

Anyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (Timber)
Face down, booty up (Timber)
That's thе way we like the what (Timbеr)
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will (Timber)

Where Lagan stream sings lullaby
There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eye
The night is on her hair
And like a love-sick lennan-shee
She has my heart in thrall
Nor life I owe nor liberty
For love is lord of all

And often when the beetle's horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling lorn
And thru the dorring peep
There on thy cricket's singing stone
She spares the bogwood fire
And hums in sad sweet undertone
The songs of heart's desire

Her welcome, like her love for me
Is from her heart within
Her warm kiss is felicity
That knows no taint of sin
And when I stir my soot to go
'Tis leaving love and light
To feel the wind of longing blow
From out the dark of night

[Verse 1]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone likе you
Like you, like you
Like you, likе you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you

[Post-Chorus]
Send your location, come through
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Send your location, come through (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Send your location, come through (Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm) (Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a hoe know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you (Like you, like you)

[Chorus]
Like you (Real life ways), like you (End these games though)
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you (Keep my cool)
Like you (With my dude), like you (In my coop)

[Outro]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like–?
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)
When winter comes
And food is scarce
We'll warn our toes
To stay indoors

When summer's gone
We'll fly away
And find the sun
When winter comes

Must fix the fence by the acre plot
Two young foxes have been nosing around
The lambs and the chickens won't feel safe until it's done

I must dig a drain by the carrot patch
The whole crop spoils if it gets too damp
And where will we be with an empty store
When winter comes?

When winter comes
And food is scarcе
We'll warn our toes
To stay indoors
When summеr's gone
We'll fly away
And find the sun
When winter comes

I must find the time to plant some trees
In the meadow where the river flows
In time to come they'll make good shade for some poor soul

When winter comes
And food is scarce
We'll warn our toes
To stay indoors

When summer's gone
We'll fly away
And find the sun
When winter comes

And find the sun
When winter comes

[Verse 1]
I know there must be other ways of feelin' free
But this is what I wanna do, who I wanna be
Every time I try, I feel like I can fly
But I know that I could die trying

[Chorus]
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can see my body through windows in my hair
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air

[Verse 2]
I know nobody's dancing here but us dragonflies
We're the only ones awake, we own the skies
Every time I try, I feel like I can fly
But I know that I could die trying

[Chorus]
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can see my body through windows in my hair
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can see my body through windows in my hair
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can see my body through windows in my hair
Hey
Oh
Oh hey
Oh
Oh hey

When you love someone so much
You feel your heart's gonna burst
The feeling goes from best to worst
You feel your heart is gonna burst
Oh

Here in my heart
I feel a deep devotion
It almost hurts
It's such a deep emotion
Emotion

Hey

The deep, deep pain of feeling
Oh
Oh hey
The deep, deep pain of feeling
Now every time it rains
It sometimes gets too much
You know I feel the pain
When I feel your loving touch

Emotion
Burns an ocean of love
You got that hot emotion
Burns an ocean of love
Ocean of love
Ocean of love
Emotion
Oh
Ocean of love
Ocean of love
Emotion

So immеnse the thrill of living
How does it feel?
So intеnse the joy of giving
How does it feel?
So immense the thrill of living
How does it feel?

The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain
Burns an ocean of love
The deep, deep pain of feeling

The deep, deep pain of feeling
Emotion

Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away

So intense the joy of giving
How does it feel?
So immense the thrill of living
How does it feel?
So intense the joy of giving
How does it feel?
So immense the thrill of living
How does it feel?
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away

[Verse 1]
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husbands and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow
Chasing tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Many choices to make
Many chains to unravel (Unravel)
Every path that we take
Makes it harder to travel
Laughter turned to sorrow
Doesn't get me down
Chasing tomorrow
Chasing tomorrow

[Bridge]
When tomorrow comes around
You'll be looking at the future (Future, future)
So keep your feet upon the ground
And get ready to run (Run)

[Verse 3]
Now hear me, mothers and men
Hear me, sisters and brothers (And brothers)
Teach your children and then
They can pass it to others
Some of them may borrow
Tales you handed down (Down)
Chasing tomorrow
Chasing tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Hear me, women and wives (Wives)
Hear me, husband and lovers (Lovers)
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down (Down)
Chasing tomorrow

[Outro]
Get ready to run
Chasing tomorrow
Get ready to run

[Intro: SoGone SoFlexy]
Shit, I was just talking 'bout
Just, that grind, the trenches, just
You know what I'm sayin', just all that
I mean, you-you don't get the vibe of it?

[Verse 1: SoGone SoFlexy]
Feels good to get this shit out the mud, nigga
Made it from hard times, it's still love for the slums, nigga
We rob niggas just because, nigga
And I'll serve you anything, but nothin' less than a dub, nigga
And how it feel to be a dub, nigga?
I'm tryna be a better man but nothin' less than a thug, nigga
I kill shit, just check my background (Bah)
This murder gang shit my campground
Check my résumé or ask 'round (Yeah)
We just simply never back down (Nah)
I caught a charge, now I'm back out
I bet this carbon blow his back out
Gettin' money, that's a fact now (Merlyn)
Bitches, they don't know how to act now (Merlyn)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
The poor more polite, but thе flow not nice (No)
Watch for your wife, I might take hеr out your life (You know)
She wet my white tee, now it's like a wet wipe (Wet it)
Respect my Tribe, I'm a dog like Phife (Get it?)
You love me like a check, but my name not Nike (Get it?)
Bitch, my number not a lottery
I'm like, "Don't even talk to me" (Stop)
Honestly, wouldn't fly a Melbourne chick to Sydney, no (Go Merlyn,  Go Merlyn)
All of these bars bought chains, prison industries (Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn)
True, America did my people foul, then give me shot for free (Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn)
While I watch Washington's wooden teeth in her booty cheeks
Kings of last century, was living like peasantry
I don't even like sleep, time is the only luxury

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sendin' a fuck you to you all
I'ma ship it, laminate it, got this shit straight off the lot
We ain't renting no AVIS
Got the neighbors going crazy
It's me, Bari, and Flexy
I can see through your bullshit, like your face was made of plexi' (Haha)
I could fuck around and get to soundin' like I'm whinin' man
Only crybaby is the one inside the buggy, man
Who, I'm the bogeyman
You, never sleep again
Nightmares, it's fright-filled the moment Freddy tuck you in
Stack my money higher than the foam atop a tidal wave
Lonely like the point guard at the key, got the isolate
Light it up, light it up, we bring the light show
Who the hell invited all they friends?
Fuck if I know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
They at your window (Them boy calling for you)
They at your window (Them boy coming for you)
They at your window (You better not tell no lies)
They at your window (You know them boys outside)
They at your window (Them boy calling for you)
They at your window (Them boy coming for you)
They at your window (You better not tell no lies)
And they ain't coming to play
You should not tell no lies

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
My pen could be a fortune teller or an ATM
It's got intentions of its own, I can't even pretend
Every moment is a fight nobody can defend
The circumstances should've never been there to begin
I watch the clocks melt as the Devil dances
The chances are slim to none that you could understand this
Lost language we incantin', pain campin'
Amongst the stillborn raindrops is where I'm standin'
I wake up breakin' up an eighth just to function
Rather be in neutral than continue to get sunken
All my niggas made it out the motherfuckin' dungeon
Tank has been on E, but I gotta keep runnin'
What you finna lean on when our system is crumbling?
Everybody's reaching but they really end up fumbling when they touchdown
Y'all don't appreciate in value like a bust down
My shit authentic, they can never get enough now

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
They at your window (Them boy calling for you)
They at your window (Them boy coming for you)
They at your window (You better not tell no lies)
And they ain't coming to play
You should not tell no lies

[Verse 5: Joba]
I can see the eye upon me when I close mine
Drug-induced comatosis leaking through me blind
The body is the temple, I invite spirits
We crack riddles and giggle behind closed blinds
Born to bleed, the brave and free
Got needs they gotsta feed, I breathe to see defeat
Fuck police and authority
Never means nothing, mind-fucking myself to sleep
Had to take it to the streets
Capitalistic greed plague all society like COVID-19
Those dirty hands that feed don't buy it
Government officials, don't give a fuck about the children
What do you believe?
Nothing's ever what it seems 'til you can't deny it
Flashpoints and flashbangs dictate defiance
History stuck on repeat in the loop of sirens
Terrorizing, always lying
Goddamn tyrants
Don't play with knives, kid

[Bridge: Ryan Beatty]
I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love you and they don't know you
I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love you and they don't owe you shit

[Interlude: Imondre Goss & Kevin Abstract]
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Yeah, nigga
We back up in this thing (Road)
Sometimes it's like, all or nothin' (Road)
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like

[Verse 6: bearface]
Just pick me up in the four-door
I'll bless the beat with smoke and rain ash like Mordor
The warlord's comin', check the lamb for the slaughter
The envy so green it should be flying a saucer, yeah
And when the pressure is on, they gone
Ghost ride whippin' not your friends no more, so long
Snake sneakin' I'm feeling like I'm missin'
But never that I'm still here bitch, so God's winnin'
Lord willing (Lord willing)
There's no ceiling (No ceiling)
They all pussy (All pussy)
Get out your feelings (Get out your feelings)
Can try and run it up but baby I'm chillin' (Uh-huh)
I make my money, then dip, stay killin'
Stay killin', stay killin', stay killin'

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Why you always start prayin' when that trouble come around?
(Why you always start prayin' when that trouble come around?)
There them boys go again
The Roadrunner

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Hahaha
Yeah (Right?)
La, la-la-la-la (Uh-huh), la-la-la-la (Mac Miller)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Uh, Teressa LaGamba)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Back again)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus: Teressa LaGamba & Mac Miller]
Been away for a little too long (Haha)
Goin' on and on and on (What?)
Why don't you stay now? (Stay)
Just laid out, go on and on and on and on and on (Uh-huh)
Been away for a little too long
Keep goin' on and on and on (Uh)
Why don't you stay now? (I like the feel of this one right here)
Just laid out, go on and on and on and on and on (What?)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I remember back then (What?), when the meal was a Lunchable
Equipped with some uncrustables, and hats were adjustable
Doin' what I love to do, music I'm in love with you (Uh-huh)
Nothin' new, hustle move, tryna make a buck or two ('Sup?)
Grab a ho off the list, got a bunch to choose
They just some fuckables, but some really in love with you (Haha)
Blowin' up my phone, why you buggin', boo?
Just wait at home, I'ma come to you
'Causе it's work now, pleasure after
This thе only thing that matters, clever rappers' heads will shatter
Guaranteed, I want it badder than anyone
Doin' it, movin' it with a purpose here (Here)
This my muhfuckin' year, that's for certain, yeah
If you doubtin', boy, I'm finna blow (Finna blow)
And, if you didn't, now you finna know (Finna know)
Ill flow, rockin' Levi's, sittin' low, sippin' somethin' with your ho
Hittin' on her tippy toes, have her singin' opera
High notes, Figaro (Haha)
Drunk as hell off this liquor, but I'm in control
So, to my opponents: How you wanna do this?
Blood, sweat and tears in this music, I've been through it
No Jay-Z workin' on these blueprints (Uh-huh)
Try and get my shit, gettin' too rich (Too rich)
And these haters in my ear like a Q-tip (Bitch)
The sound of pennies on the ground like The Cool Kids (Haha)
Music got a substance like a drug do
Chemical reaction, speakers kickin' like kung fu (What?)
So what you up to? Sittin' at the crib?
Turn your system up and come and kick it with the kid (Haha)

[Chorus: Teressa LaGamba]
Been away for a little too long
Keep goin' on and on and on
Why don't you stay now?
Just laid out, go on and on and on and on and on
Been away for a little too long
Keep goin' on and on and on
Why don't you stay now?
Just laid out, go on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Relax your mind, come and sit around
I've been high since the mornin', haven't hit the ground (Ground)
'Cause I had big dreams as a little child (What?)
And I'm well on my way here to live 'em now
Different styles intertwined like lemon and lime
Sit down, then I recline, I'm one of a kind, irreplaceable (What?)
Time, I'ma take it slow (What?), grind, I'ma make my dough
Try just to break the mold (Haha)
I know I ain't old, fa'sho I'm wise
With my eyes on the prize, never waitin' in the line (Nah)
'Cause it's no compromise, youngin who be on the rise
Keep my family on my side, haters tend to multiply
It ain't my fault that I've been headin' up the ladder
You fall down, shatter, and turn into disaster (Yeah)
I move faster, lose a few bastards (Bastards)
The new chapter, who these new rappers? (Rappers)

[?] backwards
The real tend to scare these fool actors (Haha)
So if you got somethin' to say, better cough it now
'Cause Mac's the only youngin that they talkin' about

[Chorus: Teressa LaGamba & Mac Miller]
Been away for a little too long (Uh-huh)
Goin' on and on and on (Yeah)
Why don't you stay now? (Stay)
Just laid out (Lay), go on and on and on and on and on
Been away for a little too long (Go 'head)
Goin' on and on and on (Uh-huh)
Why don't you stay now?
Just laid out, go on and on and on and on and on

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Been away for a little too long
Keep goin' on and on and on
Why don't you stay now?
Just laid out, go on and on and on and on and on
Haha, hahaha, chyeah

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Drop]
Sleeping and cocaine
Sleeping and cocaine

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somеbody else
As long as you swear you won't bе pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

[Drop]
Sleeping and cocaine
Sleeping and cocaine

[Verse 1]
I was living on the hill
By the water tower and hiking trails
And when the big one hit I'd have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Oh baby, it’s time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five-foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

[Verse 2]
These L.A. phonies and their bullshit bands
That sound like dollar signs and Amy Grant
So reads the pull quote from my last cover piecе
Entitled "The Oldest Man in Folk Rock Spеaks”
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them ‘bout the time that they don't have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

[Verse 3]
A few things the songwriter needs
Arrows of love, a mask of tragedy
But if you want ecstasy or birth control
Just run the tap until the water's cold
Anything else you can get online
A creation myth or a .45
You’re going to need one or the other to survive
Where only the armed or the funny make it out alive

[Verse 4]
Mara taunts me 'neath the tree
She's like, "Oh great, that's just what we all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously."
She's not far off, the strange thing is
That's pretty much what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to play the G
But the role of Oedipus was a total breeze

[Verse 5]
Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews
Just believably a little north of God's own truth
"He's a national treasure now, and here’s the proof
In the form of his major label debut"
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
I swear I’ll never do this, but is it okay?
Don't want to be that guy but it’s my birthday
If everything ends with a photo then I'm on my way

[Interlude]
Oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh

[Verse 6]
I watched my old gods all collapse
Were way more violent than my cartoon past
It's like my father said before he croaked:
"Son, you're killing me, and that’s all folks."
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling is getting bought?
At some point you just can't control
What people use your fake name for

[Verse 7]
So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there's always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn't use
Nonetheless, I've been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and getting by
Until I figured, if I'm here then I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlight
Maya, the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

[Verse 8]
2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming, teenage rosebuds, dirty talk
And I'm merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I'm beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them
Some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe
Plays as they all jump ship, "I used to like this guy
This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die"

[Interlude]
Oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh, oh-hoh

[Verse 9]
My first memory of music's from
The time at JCPenney's with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming, "Someone help my son!"
I relive it most times the radio's on
That "tell me lies, sweet little white lies" song
That's when I first saw the comedy won't stop for
Even little boys dying in department stores

[Verse 10]
So we leave town in total silence
New Year's Day, it's 6 o'clock AM
I've never seen Sunset this abandoned
Reminds me predictably of the world's end
It'll be good to get more space
God knows what all these suckers paid
I can stop drinking and you can write your script
But what we both think now is...

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Unstable

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber & The Kid LAROI]
Sometimes I think I overthink (Think I)
And I start to feel anxiety (Anxie—)
There were times I couldn't even breathe (Mmm)
But you never once abandoned me (No, you never, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, with The Kid LAROI]
I tried to scare you, scare you away
Showed you the door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged
Never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
White knuckles tryna hold my sanity (Hold my)
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (Never know)
But you're the one I call for security (Oh, baby)
These memories have been toxic (Oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (Oh)
Through everything, you been my rock
I think you're the only thing I didn't get wrong
Oh, I know God was listening
Every night when I would pray
You're an angel watchin' over me (Oh)
All I need

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, with The Kid LAROI]
I tried to scare you, scare you away
Showed you the door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged
Never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable

[Verse 1]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

[Verse 2]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na
More than life (Oh)

[Chorus]
So if I can't get close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Ba-ba-da, ba-da
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
She's a stranger to the night shift
The type of girl you only dream about
I was lost under the lights, yeah (Yeah)
An angel in the flames, she pulled me out

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
I'ma tell her in every kind of way (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you

(Ba-ba-da, ba-da)
I would die for you (Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba)

[Verse 2: Dominic Fike]
She's a danger to the mindset
Displaced and stretched it out in every way
Crossin' every line, yeah
T-T-Touch base until you find the chemistry
And I know this ain't rocket science
And I never leave the house
Without checkin' on you first
And begin to wonder

[Pre-Chorus: Dominic Fike, with Justin Bieber]
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
I'ma tell her in every kind of way (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die
Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you (I would die for you)
Yeah, I would die for you (I would die for you, baby)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Yeah-yeah
Yeah
I would die for you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I bought a castle in France and it's the same one
I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

[Refrain: Justin Bieber & Burna Boy]
I need to be loved by you (Oh)
I need to bе loved by you (Need to)
I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to)
I need to bе loved by you

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
I remember when we started datin'
The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is an every day ting, baby
You and me in different places
Textin' and messagin' and talkin' crazy
When I'm with you, I feel like it's a daydream
That's how I know that you would always be my baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I walk a thousand miles, I've opened every door
It's not enough, it's still your love I'm always lookin' for
It's just the way I'm wired, whether I'm wrong or right
I've only got one thing on my mind

[Refrain: Justin Bieber & Burna Boy]
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to, need to)
I need to be loved by you (You)
I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to, need to)
I need to be loved by you

[Verse 1]
Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God
And I'm so damn grateful 'cause you make up for the things I'm not
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you)
In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy lettin' go
Eight billion people, we just lookin' for a hand to hold
Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to (Hold on to)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's okay, it's okay
We all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong
'Cause of you at the end of the day

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defend you likе an army (Gon' defend you like an army)
And nеver let go (Never let go)
Yeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)
I'll be the shoulder you cry on

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody needs some-
Everybody needs somebody

[Verse 2]
Every time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star
It's the way you light up every room just bein' who you are
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you, oh woah)
Look, before I met you, I never believed in magic
But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
I know (Yeah, yeah) that you know (Yeah, yeah)
What we got, it don't come easy

[Pre-Chorus]
It's okay, it's okay
We all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong
'Cause of you at the end of the day

Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone

Everybody needs somebody

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
By myself sometimes, to give my mind some space
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts when I push your love away
I hate myself
I wanna tell you lies, so your heart won't break
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that I made my fair share of mistakes

You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away (Yeah)
You were there for me when I was actin' selfish

[Spoken Words: Martin Luther King Jr.]
I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will bе criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somеbody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well, you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justice

[Intro: Kanye West & Playboi Carti]
What? Yeah

Tattoo in my face is the mark of truth
Gotta watch what you say when they market you (Huh)
I already predicted this (I already predicted this, huh)
Y'all only witnessed it (Y'all only witnessed it)
Look, got a couple old friends that I'm not really clickin' with
I know they pray that we settle our differences

They in they feelings, I'm not really feelin' it
And I know some members that gave back they membership

Look, I act like I care, but I don't really care

You gotta move different when you in the industry, woo, yeah

If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em "sorry," they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

[Outro: Kanye West]
Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-A-Adam could never be bla-a-ack
'Cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, rib
I've laid this island sun a thousand times
I'm on it, but I'm going strange
This island's chills and shell cover me
With winded rock and skies I've yet to see

I tried, I even sent in friends
They did it as a favor, 'cause I'm not that way
I am the autumn and the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes

I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin', yeah, we're movin'

This island's sun I've laid a thousand times
Fortune me, fortune me
Of all of my mistakes I think I lent you late
Now every set pеrcent seems to come my way

But I've nеver seen a starlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I am the autumn and the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'

I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'

Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Verse 1]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your lеvel
You're so far away
You're pouring your hеart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing

Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing

Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You pull up in a foreign
You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (Front seat)
When we touch, I think we skip a beat (Beep, beep, beep)
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (Let me see)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
There’s beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss, I'm not used to this
There's nothin’ I won't give
Don't like makin' promises, just remember this

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you arе
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for

You'rе the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you different
Just the way you are

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
No matter how different, you’re beautiful
I can’t make this up, no, baby, ain't no need to beat your face in
Fenty, want you on the cover, undercovers ain’t no rubbers
On this planet, I'll treat you like a mother, let's make babies

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss
I’m not used to this
There's nothin' I won't give
Don't like makin' promises
Just remember this

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different

[Verse 3: BEAM]

Even when the fire burnin', I need you fi di light
It's a different night with you right by my side
You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright

Dem goosebumps, dem goosebumps, the truth hurt and you know
A real ting we feel this time (Oh)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different

And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

[Chorus]
Say my name

And you'll scream our names aloud
And we won't eat and we won't sleep
We'll drag bodies from the ground

We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

And we will never be afraid again

[Instrumental outro]
After all the fights and cries
You finally step back so we got tied
No more endless nights and
Suddenly everything shines

Next day I wake-up and have cereal for breakfast
Then I realize something's missing
Maybe I'm wrong but what I need is your love

Oh what I need, what I always needed
All I need is your love, your love, oh oh
But don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give
Oh but indeed I need your love

Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go and look at somеbody else
What can make it worthwhilе
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Oh what I need, what I always needed
All I need is your love, your love, oh oh
But don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give
Oh but indeed I need your love

[Verse 1]
Beautiful lies, beautiful face
Gave you forgiveness just so I could stay
Beautiful lies, heaven could wait for you
Twisting me round, twisting at you
Twenty-one songs and they're all about you
I'm gon' forget, heaven could wait for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Roses bloom when you touch my body
Try my best to make you adore me
Every night was a different story
Wish I could stop wasting my love on you

[Chorus]
I wish, wish that I could break your heart
Shatter it up like broken glass
A hundred little pieces and a hundred little stars
I wish that I could break your heart, your hеart
I wish that I could break your heart
Shatter it up likе broken glass
A hundred little pieces and a hundred little stars
I wish that I could break your heart, your heart

[Post-Chorus]
I wish that I could break your heart, your heart
I wish that I could break, wish that I could break your heart
I wish that I could break your heart, your heart

[Verse 2]
Tears on my skin, pumps to the sky
I go to parties just to feel alive
Hoping you're there, waiting 'til 4 A.M
Drive through the night, starting at stars
Roll down the window, it feels something more
Hollywood hurts, driving and I can't forget

[Chorus]
I wish, wish that I could break your heart
Shatter it up like broken glass
A hundred little pieces and a hundred little stars
I wish that I could break your heart, your heart
I wish that I could break your heart
Shatter it up like broken glass
A hundred little pieces and a hundred little stars
I wish that I could break your heart, your heart

[Post-Chorus]
I wish that I could break your heart, your heart
I wish that I could break, wish that I could break your heart
I wish that I could break your heart
I wish that I could break, wish that I could break your heart
I wish that I could break your heart
I wish that I could break, wish that I could break your heart

[Bridge]
I wish I could break your heart, baby
I wish I could break your heart, baby
I wish I could break it to million pieces, baby
I wish I could break your heart, baby
I wish I could break your heart, baby
I wish I could break your heart
I wish I could break your heart, baby, oh

[Outro]
Light it up time, falling apart for you
Ooh
Yeah, light it up time, falling apart for you

[Verse 1]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead

[Verse 2]
You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today

[Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river

[Verse 3]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Outro]
Thank you

Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus: Young Thug]
And that's murder, murder case and murder case, murder case
Murder case after murder case on murder
Black and white 

[?] brand new G Wagon
Nigga, wagon, wagon, 

[?], brr, shut up
Murdered your mama, then murdered your sister
Then murdered your brother, then murdered your nigga
Leave the whole city mad about 

[?]
I fucked around and knocked the 

[?] off your 

[?]

[Verse: Reese LAFLARE]
Fucked around and strapped a dick on a Glock
'Bout to bend her, roll over and fuck her, lеt's get it
Stack up my blue faces, hunchos and bеnjis
Fresh out the 

[?] let's handle slatt business
Yeah, they pop a nigga for the wrong business
Yeah, hop out in Prada, my linens

[Intro: Charles Bukowski]
Born like this, into this
As the chalk faces smile, as Mrs. Death laughs
As political landscapes dissolve
As the oily fish spit out their oily prey
We are born like this, into this
Into hospitals which are so expensive that it's cheaper to die
Into lawyers who charged so much, it's cheaper to plead guilty
Into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed
Into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes
Born into this, walking and living through this
Dying because of this
Castrated, debauched, disinherited, because of this
The fingers reach toward an unresponsive God
The fingers reach for the bottle, the pill, the powder
We are born into this sorrowful deadliness
There will be open and unpunished murder in the streets
It will be guns and roving mobs, land will be useless
Food will become a diminishing return
Nuclear power will be taken over by the many
Explosions will continually shape the earth
Radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
The rotting bodies of men and animals stink in the dark wind
And there will be the most beautiful silence never heard
Born out of that, the sun hidden there
Awaiting the next chapter

[Verse 1: DOOM]
DOOM from the realm of El Kulum, smelly gel fume
Separating cell womb to Melle Mel, boom
Revelations in Braille, respiration inhale, view
Nations fail and shaking of a snake tail make due
Blazing swords trace the haze, praise the Lord
Saving Grace, lace your broad, she say she bored
A crazy straw, ink and stale dry paraffin
Candy corn crap rappers pale by comparison
A bad samaritan averaging above average men
Rancid rants having rambling savages scavenging
For scraps, perhaps roadkill, if that
Gift of gab, and he flowed ill, chromе stiff hat
Known for writing lightning tight lines, chiefin'
Beefin', being off deep еnds, divine bright shines even
Dimes quiet as mimes by design mighty fine
Slight rewind, tightly bind, blind lead blind
Need mines now that was this is then, listenin'
To sizzlin' officialtons whisperin', "Him again"
Metal Face Finster playing with the dirty money
Sinister, don't know what he saying but the words be funny
Major vet spaded through the vest with a bayonet
Save your breath, gave a F, pay your debt, they forget
Make her sweat bullets, crime pays no benefits
Then it gets wilder with more childisher degenerates

[Interlude]
Three thousand years ago, Moses said:
"Every human being is responsible for his actions
Or thy being is still a beast, not yet human!"

[Verse 2: DOOM]
You ought to let your uncle flow, my motorcycle trunkfuls
From two-one two-one, lose crumbs to chunks in bundles
Hands down, better than what your mans used to get
Standing around from where the translucent looses spit
Missing wheel, you don't listen, you're a feel-head
Sitting in the kitchen pissing, twitching, kissing steel lead
Crime pays no dental nor medical
Unless you catch retirement, county, state or federal
You heard like roaring waters in a seashell
If a tree fell, you couldn't tell from three cell
Be real careful, they tell him by the earful
Kids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible
Word is bond, fix your clothes, put a shirt on
Pants sagging back when you used to meant you had a skirt on
Squirts posing as thuggers and hustlers
El Eloh closer then y'alls ball huggers and jugglers
Motherfuckers!

[Outro]
DOOM is transmitting a message to you
Super fools
I need to use more power

[Verse 1]
Why the hell would you run this game?
Both my hands are tied
Afraid of thinking I dug my own grave
Fuck around with this
Strange and elusive, too afraid to lose it
I don't mind this pain
Most niggas want you for your candy
They'll never know just how long it takes
I wave my own pride
And put it all on the line

[Chorus]
There I go, volunteering punishment
Self inflicted pain, sickness over used
Way over used
Here I stay, hey, time to time
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through

[Verse 2]
A little while longer
A bit more time
Why would you run thеse thoughts across my mind?
Please, rеlieve me
As cool as I remain
There's a point in which I'll lose my self restraint
Say, love, most niggas would've left you lonely
I fancy throwing it all away
I see it to my own demise
How much longer will I let it ride?

[Chorus]
There I go, volunteering punishment
Self inflicted pain, sickness over used
Will I let it ride? (Here I stay)
Here I stay, time to time
It must be what you put me through (yeah, time to time)
It must be what you put me through

[Outro]
Hey it must be (here I stay time to time)
It must be what you put me through
It must be what you put me through

They got your back no matter what 'til the end (Oh yeah)
Ain't got no breaks but gotta whole lotta bend
Every broken heart can mend
You better believe it..

[Verse 4: Liv Warfield and Prince]
Why is life always a mystery? (Mystery)
It will be whatever it will be (It will be)
It all depends on what you think you see
You?
I don't know, but me
I think it's gonna be...

[Chorus: Prince & Liv Warfield]
Hot summer
Hot summer (Hot summer)

Welcome to America
Where you can fail at your job
Get fired, rehired
And get a seven-hundred billion dollar tip
(Come on in, sit right down, and fill up your pockets, yeah)
Mass media, information overload
Welcome to America

Distracted by the features of the iPhone

There is no (Could it be?), arguing (Our free will?)

Get down on your knees, hit me

Welcome to America
Welcome to the big show

Anything just to keep her free from the

Said they couldn't teach what they did not know (Nothing)
That's when she lost her virginity
And now she's pimpin' every bottle (Bottle)
From New York to L.A. (L.A.)
Ask her why she do bad things
She says it's always been that way (Always been that way)
Jump back, Jack, you might be next if they try to cut mama's cake

And ask her what the deal is, this is what she say

If you ain't livin' right, you know you're
Born to die
Better watch out
Get ya, get ya so high, so high
You know everybody's getting (So high)
I gotta get my hustle on

She wants six streets in Oakland
Clear down to the 'Frisco Bay
Far as she concerned, crime does pay
Ask her when, she say from the first day
Watch you bend your knees to get back to the truth
Of who we are before we go astray (Before we go astray)
Ask her what the deal is (What the deal, daddy?)
This is what she'll say

Born to die, born to die
If you ain't livin' right, you're sure to

One, two

She called me first
No rendezvous
This sounds like drama
Now whatchu gon do?

[Chorus]
The record
Check the record now

She tried to tell me ("I tried to tell you")
As though I cared
She said you missed her
And now she's scared
You can't mislead 'em
Even though she's young
She wants her freedom
She wants to run

[Chorus]
Mm, it's about, it's about
The rеcord
Let's check the rеcord now
Check, check the record

[Interlude]
We take her places
She needs new faces
Out of the choir
She plays with fire

[Verse 3]
She'll never be a mama
If she stay wit you
This sounds like drama
But whatchu gonna do?
(Whatchu gonna do?)
If it makes her happy
Can it be that bad?
Like Sheryl said
It might be the most favorite mistake I've ever had

[Chorus]
Let's check the record
See what it say
Seem like your girlfriend
(What?)
Was in my bed

[Outro]
I don't think so
I don't think so
You know what?
You better check, check, check

It's about, it's about
The record now
Ooh
Yeah

Son of slave master
Keepin' it goin'

[Chorus: Prince & Shelby J]
How much do you want
For that real dope beat?
("How much? Possibilities")
Another A&R Man
("He can put it on ya")
Lyin' through their teeth
("I wanna see it")
Son of a slave master
Meet and greet
("You see what I'm lookin' for?")
There goes the publishing
("Let's just see it")
And you're back on the street
Back on the street

[Verse 2: Shelby J.]
Twenty-five thousand is like selling it free
Seems like a lot next to poverty
How much you really want
For all them beats?

[Refrain: Shelby J.]
Son of slave master
Keepin' it goin'
Goin', goin', goin'
Mmm

[Chorus: Prince & Shelby J.]
Uh-huh
All the Gates of Henry

Betcha if you had ur way
You'd turn back the hourglass (Oh)
What an A-S-S (Haha...)

[Refrain: Shelby J.]
Son of slave master
Keepin' it goin'
Goin', goin', goin'

[Verse 3: Shelby J.]
Hey
Don't come to the party
Unless you bring somebody (Hey!)
Somebody that wants to dance
Somebody that wants to make
Sweet romance
We still got mad love for ya
Even though really don't know ya

[Outro: Prince & Shelby J.]
Ooh
Black on black crime
Abel and Cain
You would think high yellow would be ashamed
Oh
In the twenty-first century it's still about greed and fame
I'm about to, about to go insane
Insane
Somebody call 911 and leave his name
Son of a
Son of a
Son of a slave master
Son of a
Son of a
Son of a slave master
(Master)

You know
Yeah, my hustle is strong

[Intro: Prince]
Uh, uh
Check it, one, two, uh

[Verse 1: Prince]
I hitched a train (mmhmm) between here and St. Paul
Had no idea (no) had to sleep in a pig stall (Dirty, dirty)
Once I got home, the dirt that covered me
Nothing like the disappointment that you would never see

[Chorus: Prince]
Same page but a different book
So much more in common if you'd only look
There's only one God (One God), whatever name He took
Only matters when it comes to war
What are we, what are we, what are we fighting for?

[Interlude: Prince]
Breathe
Let it breathe

[Verse 2: Prince]
New kids on the block
Tryin' to make they bed
(Mmm) Here come another rock (Here come y'all) upside their head (Oops)
There go the missiles headed for the 'hood (Oh Lord)
Trigger another car bomb did nobody no good

[Chorus: Prince]
But we're on the same page but a different book
So much more in common if you'd only look (Only look)
There's only one God (One God), whatever name He took (Whatever)
Only matters when it comes to war
What are we, what are we, what are we fighting for?

[Interlude: Prince]
Alright, listen y'all
We're about to let this thing just groove
Mm, move
C'mon

[Bridge: Shelby J.]
Chapter, verse, which came first?
Thinkin' too slow while they snatch your purse
Faith, love, good deeds, practicing what you preach
Between you and me, TV ain't reality
That's right, I said it, it's said
Buy this, cop that, all up in yo' head
Twenty-four hour news, that ain't right, huh
Them suckers got you daydreamin' at midnight (Hey)
Huh

[Verse 3: Prince]
Galatians Chapter 3 says
The law was as good as dead
Have faith in the life, death, and resurrection of the second Adam instead
Would bring our souls' salvation
If there's works in the faith we choose
But if you're all alone throwin' stones
Who do you think's gonna lose, who do you think's gonna lose?

[Chorus: Prince]
Same page (Oh) but a different book
So much more in common (hey) if you'd only look (Only look, y'all)
One God (Yes it is), whatever name He took (Tell 'em)
Only matters when it comes to war
What are we, what are we, what are we fighting for? (Oh)
Same page, different book
Same page, different book
Same page, different book
Only matters when it comes to war
What are we, what are we, what are we fighting for?

[Outro: Prince]
Same page, different book
Watch out for the sinister minister
They out there y'all
Uh
Same page (Looka here), different book
You better off chillin' 'til the world ends, mm
What are we, what are we, what are we fighting for?

Ooh, yeah, she make it clap

Told her, "Drop it down", 'cause I like that
After I hit then I'll bе right back
I walk in the club and whip out the racks
I'm blowin' on gas, she doin' hеr dance
She makin' it clap, I might have the heart attack
I walk in the club and I'm makin' it rain with them stacks
She drop it to the ground, she know that it fat

[Verse 1]
Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know

[Chorus]
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby

We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what (What), no mattеr what (What)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah, no matter what

[Verse 2]
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (Ever wanted)

[Pre-Chorus]
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know (Yeah)

[Chorus]

But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come

It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah (Yeah), no matter what

[Bridge]
Lookin' in your eyes
Can't believe you're mine
It's beyond an obsession, all of my attention
Nothing can compare to you (To you)
What did I do right? (Do right)
To hold you every night (Every night)
It's beyond an obsession, all of my attention
Nothing can compare to you

[Chorus]
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when the golden days are done (Yeah, ayy)

[Outro]
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when the golden days are done
No matter what, no matter what (Yeah, yeah)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah, no matter what

:
Enough
So Much
I’ll disappear
I cannot lie
All I got to do is wondering why when all I can do is sigh
Chorus 1:
It’s just too much for me It’s just too much for me It’s just too much for me cause I just can’t take it Enough, Enough
Enough is Enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
Verse 2:
You are a ghost from hell
And my worst nightmare
Your stories everywhere
This ain’t no truth or dare
All I got to do is wondering why for you there’s no need to cry
Pre-Chorus:
Please tell me why won't you just let me be
Chorus 2:
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, Enough
Enough is Enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
Oh no, Oh no
But I just can’t take it, just can’t take it
Spoken Bridge:
You stole my soul and ruined my reputation
You changed the mind of a whole new generation
You came to me when you were no-body
So I gave you my hand but all you took was my money. You wanted more, you wanted fame
When it didn’t work out, you were calling my name
It’s a shame
Now so many believe these stories about me
But the truth about you, the world never sees
Chorus 3:
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, Enough
Enough is Enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, Enough
Enough is Enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
It’s going down baby
It’s your sensation, manipulation
Cause I just can’t take it
Being alone, gotta stop being alone
You believed in me, gotta stop being alone. I’m alone, I’m alone
It’s just too much for me!

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

[Verse 1]
You say you gotta break away
That look in your eyes is making me nervous
Your smile
Your trying so hard not to feel helpless
When you first put it on me
I was hooked undeniably
But if you take that away from me
I won't know how to breathe

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

[Verse 2]
Every time I lose myself in your hands
I close my eyes, don't ever wanna be found again
And now you gotta leave me here
When I just got so addicted
To that sweet feeling

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

[Bridge]
Here's what I'm going through when you're gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
Talking all night to my stupid pillow
Covering in my bed like an armadillo
Waiting for that call it makes me crave for your voice
When I get you on the phone oh I want you boy
Whenever we talk the more I feel incomplete
You just can't get what I need

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
Tell me have you ever felt
Like you start fallin' down
But the sun is gonna shine again

Tell me have you ever felt
Like you've been left alone
But you know deep down you're wrong

Tell me have you ever felt
A little unsure
But then again secure

Tell me have you ever felt
Like you've been left alone
But you know deep down you're wrong
Ain't no rеason to

Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Have you evеr felt
Like givin' up but you know you love him way too much
Oh, have you ever, ever felt
Like you can't lift up your head
But you know if you can't
You can't see your man

Oh, have you ever, ever felt
Oh, I wonder have you ever felt

Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)

Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)

Somethin', somethin'
Hey
Somethin' goin' down
Hey, yea, yea

Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
Ain't no reason to
(No, no, no)
(Lyrics from supposed snippet)
What about the girl you left in Nashville, the one who still loves you?
I hope you come to find you were all I had in mind
You were everything I loved about Nashville

[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got mе like nobody

[Post-Chorus]
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-pokеr face (Oh, it's good)
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

[Verse 2]
I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Want you to know, oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
He's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

[Interlude]
Do you ever play hard to get?
(Yes) Yes
And if you don't you should

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love youk iss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous
I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous, so marvelous

[Outro]
Can't read my, can't read my
He can't read my poker face
Now you clap with me?
Ah-p-p-p-p-poker, he can't read my poker
Ah-p-p-p-p-poker, he can't read my poker
Ah-p-p-p-p-poker face

[Hook: B.o.B]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code
My back then couldn't get dro, cause back then I was this broke
That's why I got so many hustles, Bruh man from thе fifth floor
What would you do in the middle of the wintеr
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove, no doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing
Feel with my y'all, I'm this close
Spent my whole life chasin' chips, where's Nabisco?
My past memories, I miss those
Hey, all I can say is you get what you wish for
Hook: B.o.B]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
And I'm still here with a black whip full of strange clouds
And I'm still here with the same team, nigga stay down
Still here for the east side, ain't a thing change but the bank account
Hands high when I come 'round cause I'm killin this shit nigga, hands down
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad
With the soul of a soldier but even still I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like "Oh God! "
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk
But I always knew I'd go far like a gas truck with no park
So no applause, hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song
Hook: B.o.B]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

[Verse 1]
In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures
Of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

[Bridge]
I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new
I'll walk it through with you to guide me

[Verse 2]
In this world where many, many play at love
But hardly ever stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad there is you

[Outro]
More than evеr, I'm glad there is you, you
You wrapped around me
You wrapped around me
You wrapped around me
Oh!

[Verse 1]
I ain't talking junk
But I know what you want
And I ain't gotta do nothing extra just to get ya
Give me my respect
If you get no sex
I'll still have you boy (wrapped around me)
I got you wrapped around
Like surround sound
I'm no pigeon picking and I'm not finger licking
I'm your numero uno
And I bet that you know
I'd still have you boy (wrapped around me)

[Chorus]
Listen to me oh
I know I'm not perfect and all
You know that I know
There's no denying cause I got ya (wrapped around me)
Listen to me oh
I know I'm not perfect and all
You know that I know
There's no denying cause I got ya (wrapped around me)

[Verse 2]
I'm just talking slick
That's the way it goes
And you can throw your freaks out like a demo
I'm the special one
Easy to see
Boy I know I got ya (Wrapped around me)
That's why you buy me things
Treat me like a queen
Got my pinky ring flooded
Call me ice cream
I'm the chick that you pick
And I know you never leave cause I got ya (wrapped Around me)

[Chorus]
Listen to me oh
I know I'm not perfect and all
You know that I know
There's no denying cause I got ya (wrapped around me)
Listen to me oh
I know I'm not perfect and all
You know that I know
There's no denying cause I got ya (wrapped around me)

But I ain't trippin' cause you're (wrapped around me)

[Chorus]
Listen to me oh
I know I'm not perfect and all
You know that I know
There's no denying cause I got ya (wrapped around me)
Listen to me oh
I know I'm not perfect and all
You know that I know
There's no denying cause I got ya (wrapped around me)

[Verse 1: Cardigan]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus 1: Cardigan]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
'Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 2: Cardigan]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-if's
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain 1: Cardigan]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
And you'd come back to me

[Verse 3: August]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus 2: August]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge: August & Willow]
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 4: Willow]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
And now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus 3: Willow]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro: Willow]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been livin' without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
' Bout my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

[Hook 1: The Weeknd & Kanye West]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
When I'm on, an' we gon' light thе light up
Help me out when I'm goin' down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, bеfore I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

[Hook 2: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

[Hook 2: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up

[Part ll: Fall Out Of Heaven]

[Intro: Bon Iver, The-Dream & Kanye West]
What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
(There's no proof)
Those aren’t clouds
Those are the way down
Ain't no love in the playground
(Now I'm speaking truly loud)
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
Ain't no love in the playground
(Waiting by your phone)
That's a long way
And as, no one wants to fall out of heaven
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, woosh
Ballin' money, 

[?], woos, woos, woos
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign
Pop's 

[?] when you had me on
I could’ve duck when you had me on

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but

[mumbling]
And if you ever don't than get at me, at me

[mumbling]
We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week

[Hook 2: The-Dream]
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Kanye West & Young Thug]
See through the night
And forget all of your past
Throw that
Throw that away
Metro Boomin wants some more nigga

[Intro]
*Crowd cheering*

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I woke up, thankful that I woke up
The bread just got broke up
We at the fuckin' door, so what's the hold up?
I slowed up, 'cause, really, I'm in no rush
Came back to Earth a little, wasn't tryna go nuts
We still some motherfuckin' kids when we grow up
I love this shit more than Kel love drinkin' orange soda
Now I see the mornings and the afternoons
The world looks smaller from a castle view
It's Most Dope, that's the crew
Me and Tree dreamt about this all from Penn Avenue
When we was grabbin' quarters for some Newports and a Mountain Dew
I dropped a album, dude, really dropped a album
Had that shit inside of stores, I'm doin' numbers on a tour
This shit is still a dream
They either is or isn't feelin' me
But all around the world, the kids be rockin' Mac Miller tees
The devil tryna deal with me, but I don't wanna hear it
I'm the father and the son, and its fuckin' holy spirit
These are lyrics for the mind, a little food for thought
Who'da thought that we would be here? Everybody shocked
You see, Q never had a problem callin' out hits
I was always havin' problems, prolly a-bout a bitch

[Chorus 1]
And I pray to God we make it
Hold this shit close, it's sacred
This life is so outrageous
Just hold on, we ain't close to done

[Verse 2]
You see, I've been up, I've been down
I get through this binge now
The man since I've been out, everybody's friend now
I'm sick of these trends now, I've seen what they end like
They say I need help, go see what yourself like
I'm nervous, I'm anxious, the hurtin'
The pain is so much, I can't take it, take off in a spaceship
I love this, I hate it, I need a vacation
They say, "Where your next shit? The people been waitin'"
I'm stressin' 'bout exes and things I've neglected
I just want the best for everyone that's present, so
I think it's time to let it go, yeah

[Chorus 2]
They all wonder where we go from here
Everybody wonder where we go from here
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Tell me when the road is clear, yeah

[Outro]

Starlight
I need you
All night
Come on dance with me
Come on dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
I'm one of the greatest, ain't no debatin' on it
I'm still levitated, I'm heavily medicated
Ironic I gave 'em love and they end up hatin' on me
She told me she love me and she been waitin'
Been fightin' hard for your love and I'm runnin' thin on my patience
Needed someone to hug, even took it back to the basics
You see what you got me out here doin'?
Mighta threw me off, but can't nobody stop the movement
Uh-uh, let's go
Left foot, right foot, levitatin'
Pop star, Dua Lipa with DaBaby
I had to lace my shoes for all the blessings I was chasin'
If I ever slip, I'll fall into a better situation
So catch up, go put some cheese on it
Get out and get your bread up
They always leave when you fall, but you run together
Weight of the world on my shoulders, I kept my head up
So baby, stand up, 'cause, girl, you

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & DaBaby]
You want me (Hey), I want you, baby (Hey)
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Surface, will it suffice?
The clay grows dry, but you keep your borders guarded
And the heights of which you own
Feed me rhinestones
Bowing into the void

[Chorus]
A way to get sun when your heart's not open
A way to get sun when your heart's not open

[Verse 2]
Ghosts, hidden eggshell
No rebel yell, comfort in vacant waters
And I awake, purging of fear
A task that you wear
Dormant valiance, it falls

[Chorus]
A way to get sun when your heart's not open, ah-ah
A way to get sun when your heart's not open, ooh
A way to get sun when your heart's not open
A way to get sun when your heart's not open, woah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

[Intro]
Hoah, hoah
Hoah, hoah

[Verse 1]
If I were a leopard slug I would reach out with the
Blue rose of ours, wrapping myself around you
High up in the tree tops, we could get lost in our lust, ooh, us
If I were a sea horse I'd only dance around you
Underneath the green water, I could fill you up
You could be my daddy-o, we could get lost in our lust, oh, us

[Chorus]
Oh, all I wanna do, ah
And it's all, all I wanna do
Oh, all I wanna do, ah, oh
And it's all, all I wanna do

[Bridge]
Close to your molecules
Close to your molecules

[Verse 2]
If I were a hummingbird your wings would beat like thunder
Orbit in a flight display, as if to gently say
"Kiss the flowers, ultraviolet"
We could get lost or we could find it, alive with
Electrons in the air on fire, lightning kissing metal
Whisper to the tiny hairs, battery on my tongue
Meteor that greets Sahara, we could get lost in static power, ours

[Chorus]
Oh, all I wanna do, ah
And it's all, all I wanna do
Oh, all I wanna do, ah, oh
All, all I wanna do

[Outro]
Close to your molecules
Close to your molecules, I wanna be (Be, ah, ah)
Close to your molecules
Close to your molecules, I wanna be (Be, be)
Close to your molecules (Be)
Close to your molecules, I wanna be (Be)
Close to your molecules
Close to your molecules, I wanna be

Do you light up at a fire, or the sight of an iPhone
Tea light candles, orange and yellow
I don't want you to burn, I don't want you to burn, no
I don't want you to burn, no
Do you light up at a fire or the sight of an iPhone
Tea light candles, orange and yellow
I don't want you to burn, I don't want you to burn, no
I don't want you to burn, no

We go far and we go gentle

Draw into the sky, drink me with your eyes
Breath on the ground, work the land now
As it falls, as it falls around (Wooh)

Safe in my hand or
Stepping Razor
To belong, to belong never
Cradle of venom
Tongue tied, watch it now
As it falls, as it falls around

[Chorus]
All the words we don't say, all the words we don't say
All the words we don't say, all the words we don't, all the words we don't

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh, ahh la la ahh, ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

Draw in to the sky, drink me with your eyes
Breath on the ground, work the land now
As it falls, as it falls around

[Bridge]
All the words that we don't say, yeah (Wooh)
All the words that we don't say, yeah

[Chorus]
All the words we don't say (Say), all the words we don't say (Say)

All the words we don't say (Say), all the words we don't say (Say)

All the words we don't say (Say), all the words we don't say (Say)
All the words we don't say (Say), all the words we don't, all the words we don't

[Chorus]
Rose water, pour a little over me, over me, ah
Rose water, pour a little over me, over me, ah oh
All over me, yeah, hey

All of my heart, all of my heart
It wants to hold you (It wants to hold you)
All of my heart, all of my heart
All of my heart

[Chorus]
Rose water, pour a little over me, over me, ah
Rosе water, pour a little over mе, over me, ah oh
All over me, yeah, yey
All over me, yeah, yey
All over me, yeah, yey
All over me, yeah, yey

[Verse 2]
My Hayati, leopard pearl
In the arms of my lover
I draw your outline with scent of amber
My Hayati, leopard pearl
In the arms of my lover, got to kiss the fire flower
More valiant as the walls of Petra

[Outro]
All of my heart, it wants to hold you
All of my heart, all of my heart
All of my heart, it wants to hold you
All of my heart, all of my heart

[Verse 1]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
Feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be anywhere but here
I don't wanna be anywhere but here, mm

[Verse 2]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
Feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be anywhere but here
I don't wanna be anywhere but here, mm

[Verse 3]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
Feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be anywhere but here
I don't wanna be anywhere but here

[Outro]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, I got a red room

[Verse 1]
No, I can't keep on breaking apart
Grow like waratah
He said I always take it too far
Sharp like cobra arch

Maybe if I was hard and not so
"I got a little bit, you got a little bit, we can get over it"
Or maybe if I was hard and not so emotional

[Chorus]
If I had a little, yeah, eh
If I had a little, ah, yeah, eh
If I had a little, ah, ah, ah
If I had a little, ah, ah
If I had a little

[Verse 2]
We need your love and not deadly nightshade
Wait
Wait for the cards to fall into place
Blame it on the sun, turn your face (Oh)

[Chorus]
If I had a little, aoh, ah
If I had a little, aoh, ah
If I had a little, ah, ah ah
If I had a little
If I had a little

[Bridge]
Maybe if I was hard and not so
"I got a little bit, you got a little bit, we can get over it"
Or maybe if I was hard and not so emotional
Maybe if I was hard and not so
"I got a little bit, you got a little bit, we can get over it"
Or maybe if I was hard and not so emotional

[Outro]
If I had a little
If I had a little

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Belong to love, please don't bury us unless we're seeds
Learn to forgive, you know very well it's not easy
It's so simple to read without living in its meaning

[Chorus 1]
Breathe, slow down, stand for something if not anything
Breathe, slow down, we could get closer without the yearning

Please believe me, please believe me when I say
Someday it will be okay
Please believe me, please believe me when I say
That I know, that I know
We will get over, only if we wanna
That I know it, that I know
We could get over, only if we wanna
Please believe me, please believe me when I say
Someday it will be okay

[Verse 2]
Who are they when they meet?
Stone or lavender?
Before the word is ever uttered
Was your leap deeper?
Show her clover and wildflowers when the soul is tired and needing
Do not grieve the idle time or all the moments that are ever-leaving

[Chorus 2]
Take me far away from myself
Rest, don't rest like everyone else
I don't wanna be small, I wanna be full of life
We can weave all things together and be alright, ooh

Please believe me, please believe me when I say
I know that I know we could get over, only if we wanna
That I know, that I know we will get over, only if we wanna
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
We will get over, only if we wanna
That I know, that I know we will get over, only if we wanna

[Outro]
Please believe me, please believe me when I say
Someday it will be okay

[Intro]
Duh-duh, you, duh-duh, you
Duh-duh, you, duh-duh, you

[Verse 1]
Not a speck of dust on chrysanthemum (Duh-duh, you)
Feather on the breath of the mother tongue
Awake in full bloom with the sleeping sun
Pomegranate jewel between lip and thumb

[Chorus]
We are only, love and longing
We are only, love and longing
Duh-duh, you
Duh-duh, you
Duh-duh, you, duh

[Verse 2]
It's all clearer beyond fawn and weather
Hands and cheek and flowers pressed together
When the sea and sky are one like mirror
When the wind and river are old lovers

[Chorus]
We are only, love and longing
We are only, love and longing, ah
You could get through to the blood and marrow
You, you could get through to the blood and marrow
Deeper than a cinder in snow
You could get through to the blood and marrow
Deeper than a cinder in snow
You could get through to the blood and marrow

[Verse 3]
And silently
Bathe the body in silence
Bathe the body in silence
And let it eat you alive

[Bridge]
You could get through to the blood and marrow
Deeper than a cinder in snow
You could get through to the blood and marrow
Deeper than a cinder in snow
You could get through to the blood and marrow

[Outro]
Not a speck of dust on chrysanthemum

[Intro]
Baby, if you're feeling lonely
And if you really want me
I'm yours

[Verse 1]
I can't hold back
Something's on my mind
You had a love for a boy
But I'm real this time
Don't let your fears of your past broken heart
Interfere with our lovin'
It's real from the start

[Chorus]
Baby, if you're feeling lonely
And you really want me
I'm yours
Baby, you just gotta call me
I'll be here forever
I'm yours

[Verse 2]
No matter how near or far
Call on me
Whenever you're down I'll be your helping hand
In your time of need
Cause the thought of you brings happiness to my life
Boy I'm right here
My message is clear
You're always on my mind

[Intro]
Yeah, that's cool
And I take a whole chunk of it, some of it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I done came down, bumpin’ Flexy
Niggas all around me lookin' sexy
Locked in the crib, smokin' on some shit
Got a nigga seein’ stars, that's just how a nigga live
These prayers seem like they're goin' nowhere these days
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Turn me up, I'm trying to get in tune with the DJ
Yеah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yеah, yeah

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Beamer?
Young rich nigga steppin' in the arena
Baby girl a dreamer, give me brain like Eureka
I'm absorbin' everything around me now, amoeba
You know I’m that nigga, did you get amnesia?
Spinnin’ in San Marcos, shout out Pauline with the pizza
I'm the diarrhea, fold ’em like tortilla
Stayin' on my toes, baby, ballin' ballerina
Who you think you talking to? I got no idea
TV on paprika, smokin' anesthesia
Hit ’em with the cleaner, young street sweeper
Sound gettin' meaner while a nigga gettin' greener

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Easy with the teeth before you choke on this dick (Ha)
Michiko Malandro on the run, smoke off the lips (Straight off the lips)
I ain't sayin' no names since they cut me a check (Cut me a check)
Baby up in Villa and I love the whole set
Let it sit on me (Let it sit)
Got that glitter on me (Got that glitter)
Oh, your thick lil' thighs got a grip on me (Got a grip)
Watch you ride on me (Ha)
Lil' bitch slide on me (Slide)
Pullin' out, then bust it open, let her shimmy on me
Push it, push it, push it just like this
Shake it, shake it, shake it out the dress

[Verse 4: Joba]
Weed going straight to my head
Meet me on the bed
Kick off my kicks
She fiend for the dick
Spit on the tip
Spit in her mouth
Cum on the couch
I don't give a fuck
Take you to the steam room, rinse off the nut
Bitch, we goin' nuts, bitch 'bout to bust
Me and all my dogs stayin' up
Sleep is for the weak, so I tweak goin' dumb

[Refrain: Joba]
You know I get— get—
You know I get down
Y— you know I get— get—
You know I get down
Y— you know I get— get—
You know I get down
Y— you know

[Verse 5: Bearface]
Smack that when she playin' Buju in the motherfucking hatchback
How you throwin' all that ass expectin' me to catch that?
Knew you tryna tell me with that Tennessee accent
This a crazy story, wait a minute, let me backtrack
She just told me grip up on her shoulders, make her back crack
Said her pussy water, I'm a dog and I'ma lap that
Heard me hit that high note, I kiss on her and she match that
She said, "Why you talkin', boy? I'm sick of all the backchat"

[Verse 6: Merlyn Wood, Bearface, & Both]
Does your man even exist? Lil' bitch, I ain't seen him yet
Tear that ass up, make your man do the renovate
Slim thick and she finna hit like a cigarette
Take you where you want like my Glock if you take the stick
¿Señorita, qué lo qué? (¿Qué lo qué?)
Ooh, lil' mami, wish I knew what you said (I wish I knew)
She Boriqua with the braids
I guess she a genius way she do it with the brain, woah
Throw it 'til you're tappin' out, throw it 'til your back blow out
Throw it like you Tarzan, this big dick you swingin' on
Ass ripple like avalanche, dancin', I'm skiin' on it
Hit my cup slow to this, drop it low to this
No, I don't miss the bitch, 'cause I don't miss, bitch
Hit my cup slow to this, drop it low to this
No, I don't miss the bitch, 'cause I don't miss, bitch

[Refrain: Joba]
You know I get— get—
You know I get down
Y— you know (Down)
You know I get down
Y— you know I get down
You know I get down
Y— you know (Down)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Lettin' my hair down

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Pull up on four-fours, that's how it goes
I need the stars to hеlp a nigga find his way back home
Just was like, "I'm ready to hit a lick on that store"
Lick the chest and it's the rest, history do unfold
History lose control (Control), history lose control (Control)
Knock my way like bowling pin, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah
So pull up on four-fours like that raging bull was askin' you
And if the money stay the same, then I'm gon' change my attitude

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent
Jeremiah, weepin' prophets, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
See me out, by the way, I'll be out late
Summertime in the back, goin' sideways
Pack it up, stack it up by the driveway
You do you all the time, I don't mind it

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood & Matt Champion]
What I'm smokin' (Smoke), put account in a coma (Go)
Hot and black like Folgers, she got me off this mornin'
If your shawty your shawty, why she do my chores for me? (Tell me why)
Heels over her head, her sole ends up on the ceiling (Oh my)
Try me, shit fit in my jeans, don't need Balmain
Talkin', all you do is talkin', be honest (Oh my)
Lil' bitch makin' love, then askin' for a hundred
College to Coachella, this work and vacation (You gotta go)
'Cause the time you stop the party is the time we clock in (Ayy, let's go)
I was in the booth 'til six in the mornin'

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty, Ryan Beatty]
Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent
Jeremiah, weepin' prophets, yeah, yeah
Eat my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lettin' my hair down

Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent
Jeremiah, weepin' prophets, yeah, yeah
Eat my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Big boat in this bitch, nigga (Masi)

[Chorus]
Keep all my trusty bad hoes in the back (Slatt)
Wanna give more bitches one hunnid’ racks (Yeah)

Bet on my bullshit, I run with the pack

Fergus on ten, robbing the man (Muah)
Thirty thousand on decor in the den
Parked the Maybach on the block on the west end (Skrrt)
Been a long time since I slicked out the weston (Yeah)
Check my complexion, I’m black as the street
I don’t get checked, walkin’ in with the heat
Got a 488, I'ma

Step in real hard and the socks fitted
All that kee-keeing gon’ get yo lil’ mouth knitted, sown up
Still the same nigga, just grown up (Yeah)

[Verse]
Niggas say they gone do it but ain’t showin’ up
Who’s talking that shit, nigga, own up (Who?)
I spent four million dollars on jewelry (Yeah)
And for folks to be saying I’m broke, man that shit is foolery
I think they want me to get on the coonery (On god)
Stop sledging on niggas, I’m flexin' (On god)
Who the fuck askin’ these niggas up
Who the fuck treatin’ them like the X-Man (Who the fuck?)
In my crib don’t say fuck on the estcy (What the fuck?)
You want smoke, where I’m at you can find me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I will be myself
Until it's time
For me to fly

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Be yourself
Be yourself

Be yourself
Be yourself

Be yourself
Be yourself

Be yourself...
I just want to take you there
He don't got to know where
Does he touch you here like this?
Let me take the friction from your lips

And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'mma give you girl, what you feel
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

I got everything you want from me
I do everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby leave them high heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're looking down at me, I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty watch me knock your boots off
And I'mma love you girl, the way you need
Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon' stop us
And I'mma give you girl, what you feel
I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
In the center of the silence
Violent thoughts are thrown through the thick smoke
And flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes, it's someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've bеgun to run an endless race
But I nеver looked back when I begin it
I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Sometimes, you've got no control of where you go
Taking down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost that you wanna hide your face
You don't recognize the place you're in
Sometimes, the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes, the night doesn't turn to day
But sometimes, the light's so bright, it burns through the night
And keeps the darkness at bay (Run away)

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it
I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough, you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them with me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Follow the link in the chain without a name
Seal the light and the darkened days remains
Taken away from the place you've been trapped
Break all you know, then bring it all back

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it
I know that this is the sun behind the rain
Even though, sometimes, I feel I can't stand another minute
May've begun to run an endless race
But I never looked back when I begin it

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough, you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them along with me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She can't hide, no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguise behind the lies
And at night, she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Mark Wakefield]
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(I'm too weak to facе me!) She can only fool hersеlf

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he can't hold the reigns
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Mark Wakefield]
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) He can only fool himself

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed Media slang bangin' in your boombox
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killin' me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility

I heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for yеars

But now, they're getting randomly mixеd and matched up
All after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You wanna be an MC? You've gotta study the skill

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mark Wakefield]
So, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally, you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit)
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40 (Top 40)

And your record company is completely missin' it
All the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate
So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with wack shit
And get smacked with verbal backflips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MC's to establish this
You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic, leave that to the experienced

[Break: Mike Shinoda]
Using the waves of sound
The true master paralyzes his opponents
Leaving him vulnerable to attack

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up! Step up!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
After years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
We here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
And the question must be asked…

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

[Outro]
Mix Media
Step up the microphone
And you do it like this
And you do it like…
Step up the microphone

And you do it like this

Step up the microphone
And you do it like this
Mix Media
Step Up the microphone
And you do it like this

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is how it's done, going for the title and crown
Renowned emcees surround as the beat breaks down
Into elements, bobbing of those the Buddha blessed
Finesse the M-I-C, the way it ought to be finessed, yes

Yes, am I the one to keep you on your toes?
Most definitely in my B-boy pose
It's the Electric Boogaloo with a slight twist
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this:

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Emcees dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic
Now it's like, "Sit! Stay!"
Cobra Kai flystyles, I'm kicking
Sticking emcees real quick 'cause times ticking
At the drop of a tenpence, I let loose the venom
Sending a shot of verbal heat up in them
The ending is done, grab your family and run
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun

Record industry rule four thousand eighty-one:
Question my intentions and your whole world is done
Like Forrest, you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn
Full Metal Jacket, fully auto-rhyme pattern

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Mark Wakefield]
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving

Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving
Sticking, rock your whole clique and I'm wicked
Moving, booming of our tunes and you're grooving

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Now I see what I have, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move
Now I see what I had, I want you
Be with me, or stick and move

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Every day, reminded how much I hate it
Weighed it against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with the gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rather not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
This part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
Part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Intro: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the thread to the needle, middle-to-end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then, with the еyes tightly shut
Lookin' through the rust, and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
Pours itsеlf upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
A window then grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small, black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothin' stops in this land of the chain
When brains lose, not knowin' they were part of the game
And then, the insides grow, but the box stays the same
In shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Outro: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies keep piling up

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
A certified chemist with a bachelor in beats
And break a beaker on your brain
And turn your mind to minced meats
Stethoscope is headphones to the heart of CD’s
Hundred three BPM equals ninety degrees
Celsius, adjust your ventilator to ten (Ten)
Inject the fluid flow into the hearts of men
Through IV’s, in search for a sample of hits
And make the Frankenstein of funk out of musical bits

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I’m turning off my head
I’m going through these changes
I want you to be here
I’m turning off my hеad
I’m going through these changes
I want you to bе here

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Laboratories stores from the def-
You're not ready for the comedown, it'll turn it all upside down
When it's all over, I'll call you for company, that's your medicine
I'll be trying to come back to me, she needs me more than you do
I'll be happy for you, whether I'm there, whether you're not
Whether we're anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere

Always lonely in a crowd
I don't always mean to talk so loud
Tell thе fishes, I say "hello"
I'll make somе wishes and burn them in the snow
I don't need a place in your happiness, for me to feel happy for you
I just want to see you smile, whenever I can
Whenever you let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in

Always lonely in a crowd
I don't always mean to talk so loud
Tell the fishes, I say "hello"
I'll make some wishes and burn them in the snow

[Verse 1]
"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, aaaaaah)

[Verse 2]
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
Yawning, rubbed the sleep away and
Very sane he seemed to me

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
'Til you come
(Waiting so long, aaaaaah)

[Outro]
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Waiting so long aaaaaah
Waiting so long, I've been waiting
Waiting so long, I've been waiting
Waiting so long, I've been waiting
Waiting so long, I've been waiting

[Spoken]
Hello!
Let's go back into the recess of time
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I was not there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
Made my way back home
I searched for form and land
Years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely star
Of all the millions here
We must have died alonе
A long, long time ago
Who knows, not me
We nеver lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world, yeah

(extended live instrumentals/guitar solo)

Who knows, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Oh no; not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold ...
The world

[spoken: Thank you
Thanks very much that was it, written in 1968 ...]
Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again
I shake!
And stare at the sun
Til my eyes burn
I shake!
At the mothers brutal vermin
I shake!
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine

I shake!
(Turn and turn again)
(Turn and turn again)
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw!
Is a tightening atrocity
I shake!
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell
The need?
To have seen it all
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction
As beauty
I shake!
Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again
Yeah, I shake!
Turn and turn again
I shake!

[Piano solo]
I shake!

[Piano solo]
I shake!

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day, call it a day

Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day, call it a day

Research has pierced

1,2,3; 1,2,3 .. ]

Hallo Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette
So stationary
You're released but your custody calls

And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free?

Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me

Bye-bye love
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye love
Yeah ...
This chaos is killing me

Now Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning (uh-huh)
For the finger points at me

(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell (toll the bell)
Pay the private eye (aw yeah)
(All's well) All's well
20th century dies
Yow
Yow

And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
But I fear my days are numbered
Lord, get me out of here
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell (toll the bell)
Pay the private eye
Pay the private eye
(All's well) All's well
20th century dies (yo)

That's your shadow on my wall
This is what I could've been

Wheels are turning and turning
As the Twentieth Century dies
If I had not met Ramona
If time had not stood still
If I had not ripped the fabric
If I'd only paid my bill

(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell (toll the bell)
Pay the private eye
Pay the private eye
(All's well) All's well
This 20th century dies, ya

This is my food
This is my bunk with two sheets

[Outro Choruses]
Toll the bell

(thank you)
Oh!
Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen
(yeah)

Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
Can't you see
Otherwise me

Such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you
Ooh-hoo

Now baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen
Uh-oh, listen
Don't look at your carpet
I drew something awful on it
Can't you see?
It was me
Such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you
Oh you're a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you
This is a song from '92; recent stuff ...

When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoos
Streaking cathedral spires

They say
They say
They say
He’s got two gods
They say
He's got no eyes
They say
He was born again
They say
Look at him climb
They say 'jump’
They say 'jump'
Oh-ho yeah, yeah
They say
He's got two gods
They say
He has no fear
They say
He has no eyes
They say
He has no mouth
They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'jump'
They say ’jump’
Watch out!
Watch out!

They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend, don’t listen to the crowd

They say 'jump'
Got to believe somebody

They say 'jump’
Got to believe somebody
They say 'jump'
Got to believe somebody

They say 'jump'
Got to believe somebody

They say 'jump'
Yeah, jump!
Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real-life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire I guess the season is on
So you train by shadowboxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still, you push, still, you push your luck
A broken-nosed mogul are you one of the new wave boys
Same old thing in brand new drag comes sweeping into view
As ugly as a teenage millionaire pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside and say
"Well, David, what shall i do? They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no no they can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
The word is that hunted one is not there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
I miss you he really had to go well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife
Another piece of teenage wildlife, another piece of teenage wild
Wild
Wild
Wild
Oh this is no nice and old fashioned
Coming out and doing the encore ...

I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm the space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
I'm bustin' up my brains for the words

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space-face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Don't fake it, baby
Lay the real thing on me
Y'know the church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Don't fake it, baby
Make me know you really care
Makе me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric еye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space-face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
Oh ...

[Instrumental break with piano and guitar solos]

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space-face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space-face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
Freak out
Oh
Brrr-ah!
Oh yeah
Freak out
All out!
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah

Ah-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-ooh-oh
Ah ah ooh ooh

Oh-oh-ah-oh-oh, oh, oh
Prick - prick you

[Verse 1]
White boys falling on the fires of night

Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way

I'd rather be inside you

[Chorus]

All the little fragile champion boys

Drifting from the answer
Then, guns

[Chorus]
Tell the truth yeah yeah

Even if you disagree
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes

Toys, toys, little black toys

Even if you disagree
Thank you, I love y'all
Indulge us here, participation, hey?
We're doing one of the songs which is gonna be the next single
We're gonna make a video, right now, once
And the next single is gonna be "Space Boy"
And here it is:

Yeah!

Hallo Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette
So stationary
You're released, but your custody calls

And I want to be free
Don't you wanna be free

Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days
But Moon dust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me
(woo-hoo)
Byе-bye love (ya)
Bye-byе love (woo-hoo)
Bye-bye love (woo-hoo!)
Bye-bye love (woo-hoo)
Yeah

This chaos is killing me

Hallo Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette:
So stationary
You're released, but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free

Do you like girls or boys
Yeah, it's confusing these days
But moon dust will cover you, cover you

But this chaos is killing me

Bye-bye love
Bye-bye love (woo-hoo, yeah)
Bye-bye love
Bye-bye love
Goodbye, space boy

[Piano solo]

This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me

Bye-bye love

Bye-bye love

Good time, love (oh yeah!)
Sweet sweet love
Goodbye Spaceboy
Bye-bye love (woo, yeah)

Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you
Moon dust will cover you!
"What’ll it be now, Mr. Mole?"
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
"Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones"

[Chorus]
Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you dry

[Verse 2]
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo

[Chorus]
Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you dry

[Verse 3]
"Wanna play cheat now?" says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold

[Chorus]
Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you dry

[Outro]
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you

[Verse 1]
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Verse 2]
Truth be told
I've been there, I'vе done this all before
I takе your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Bridge]
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows, now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Chorus]
My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
“You know who I am”, he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
“It's time we should be going”

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger
Driven by the night
Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger
Read it in my voice
Til you come
(Waiting so long, ahh, ahh)

[Guitar solo]

No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
'Til you comе
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger
Feel it in my voice
'Til you comе

[Outro]
Waiting so long, ahh, ahh
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so
Waiting so long, ahh, ahh

Take it!

[Instrumental, guitar and piano emphasized]
Now
Not tomorrow
Or yesterday
Not tomorrow

It happens today
The damage today
The crazed in the hot zone
They beat on the outside
I'll stand by you

Now
Not tomorrow
Or yesterday
Not tomorrow

It happens today
The crazed in the hot zone
The mental and diva's hands
To the music outside
To the music outside
The music outside

[Guitar solo]

It's happening now
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening

Now
Not tomorrow
Or yesterday
Not tomorrow

The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside

Outside
Outside
Outside
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are

Put a peephole in my brain
Two new Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Guitar solo]

Andy died and Andy tired
Andy take a little cruise
Tie him up and send him out --
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of mе and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
Jolly boring thing to do

Andy Warhol looks a scrеam
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all-all-all

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all-all-all

Can't tell them apart at all
Can't tell them apart at all
Can't tell them apart at all
Can't tell them apart at all

Can't tell them apart
Tell them apart
Tell them apart
At all
Can't tell them apart
Tell them apart
Tell them apart
At all

Tell them apart
Tell them apart
Tell them apart
Tell them apart

Tell them apart
Tell them apart
Tell them apart
Now baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen

I drew something awful on it
Can't you see

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, let me touch you
Oh, no-oh

[Extended guitar solo]

Ooh
Ow!

Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen
Don't look at your carpet

Can't you see
It was me!

Such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh, let me touch you

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh let me touch you

Thank you

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm back like I never left
In this motherfucker spitting rhymes 'til my last breath
Snoop Dogg in the building, yes, y'all
Line 'em up, barber shop, fade 'em all
I'm watching the game from the halls of fame
I'm balling, mayne, I boss up back in this thang
Believe me, bro, you wanna stick around and see the show
See me go, Snoop Dogg, CEO
Proceed to capitalize, I'm back with my guys, slapping the five
Making more hits to slap in your trunk
They know this is gangsta funk
Take your risk and get what you want
Fuck with this, I figured he won't
Figured they lying, I'm a cold muthafucka, it's getting chilly
I didn't really wanna fuck him up and slap him silly
So I ran that bitch-ass nigga up out the city

[Chorus]
Back up in the motherfucker, tell me how you feel now (How you feel now, oh)
Either you're fake or you're plastic, it's hard to keep it real now (What? So real)
How many niggas you shot, how much money you got
And do you really post up on the block?
Not ordinary, it may vary
I get my means by any means necessary

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm on my shit, only boss niggas that I'm with
Still no talking from my bitch
Slick nigga but don't slip
You don't wanna be on the wrong side of that four-fifth
Don Dada, want a lotta
Niggas wanna fuck around with that gun shotta
Ambitions of a rider
Machiavelli tip, sitting back, let it rip
I'm on a private island, million on a trip
Level up, niggas don't move 'til I tell 'em what it is
I'm 'bout to blow this whole label up, ya dig?
I got a plan to change up the game, it's big
Listen close and follow me
I'm 'bout to tell you how it's 'bout to be
Check the game and the pedigree
I'm the same nigga from the Beach
With more knowledge and more game, the best weed
Real talk, nigga, preach

[Chorus]
Back up in the motherfucker, tell me how you feel now (We back, we back, we back)
Either you're fake or you're plastic, it's hard to keep it real now (Fake-ass nigga)
How my niggas you shot, how much money you got
And do you really post up on the block?
Not ordinary, it may vary
I get my means by any means necessary

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Rick Rock
Snoop Dogg, haha, CEO
(Once again back, it's the incredible)
That's right y'all, that nigga is the CE— (Death Row, what a nigga know?)
(Once again back, it's the incredible)
The what? The CEO (Death Row, what a nigga know?)
(Once again back, it's the incredible)
Yeah, nigga (Death Row, what a nigga know?)
(Once again back, it's the incredible)
Now let it ride (Death Row, what a nigga know?)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Snippet: Billie Eilish & Billie Eilish, FINNEAS]
I hate myself
Maybe that's the reason I love you, you
I know you too well
But you say it so good, hmm
We go, you're mine, baby, mine
Starstruck, and blind
Now, I know where you might find
Too sweet
Put it together and go
It's all that I want, someone, to make me

[Verse]
I-I-I thought I found the answer to it (To it)
Eternal happiness tonight (Hey)
But it was just another blip in my heart
Sometimes I think of calling you up
To make myself look bad again
But now I'm bringing flowers to your front door
Last night I had a dream, we started dating now you're pissing me off
I know it's not l-l-love (Yeah)
It's not something I want
I'm not attracted to you, like I was
Back at the start (Back at the start)
Back at the start

[Outro]
You're in my head, so I can't now forget you
You're in my head, so I can't, so I can't now
You're in my head, so I can't now forget you
You're in my head, so I can't now forget you

[Chorus]
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good, good, good
That's never gonna change
Never gonna change

[Drop]

[Chorus]
We're not meant to
We're not meant to be
We'rе not meant to be, that's nevеr gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good, good, good
That's never gonna change
Never gonna change

[Verse: PinkPantheress & Fat Joe]
I don't think my mom or my dad think it's funny (Funny)
That I'm spending all their money (Money)
I know I can't afford it, wish they would just (Check it, hey)
Back when I was young I'd ask and I'd get it
No matter how hard I'd cry
What I wanted they would buy (Yeah)
You can't buy my trust
When you haven't got the love (Yeah)
And when time costs too much
Then you'll end up in a rush
You can spend everything
Long as you'll spend time with me (You'll spend time with me)
As long as you'll spend time with me (Hey)

[Outro: Fat Joe]
(I'm meeting the real queen...)

[Verse 1]
You're leavin' early and you're comin' in late
The bed you left me has already been made
You're makin' promises and then break 'em all
Somebody's 'bout to get a wake-up call

[Chorus]
I ain't your hotel, motel, holiday-inn
Ain't got no HBO, no pool or swim
Yeah, you're checkin' out as soon as you're checkin' in
Damn, if I'm ever gonna do it again
I ain't your hotel
Your kiss an' no tell

[Verse 2]
I've kept these curtains closed as tight as I can, but
Somehow the truths will always find their way in
Mini-bar's empty and the ice is all gone
Might bе hungover but I ain't hangin' on, but

[Chorus]
I ain't your hotel, motel, holiday-inn
Ain't got no HBO, no pool or swim
Yеah, you're checkin' out as soon as you're checkin' in
Damn, if I'm ever gonna do it again
I ain't your hotel
Your kiss an' no tell

[Bridge]
I'm not your dirty little secret
You only love me when you need it
The last time, was the last time
The lights are burnt out on my vacancies sign

[Chorus]
I ain't your hotel, motel, holiday-inn
Ain't got no HBO, no pool or swim
Yeah, you're checkin' out as soon as you're checkin' in
Damn, if I'm ever gonna do it again
I ain't your hotel, motel, holiday-inn
Ain't got no HBO, no pool or swim
Yeah, you're checkin' out as soon as you're checkin' in
Damn, if I'm ever gonna do it again
I ain't your hotel
Your kiss an' no tell

[Outro]
Ooo
Ooo

[Intro]
What's it take to call your brother?
Just to say you miss him and you wish you could spend time
What's so serious that you can't just pick up the phone?
Let him know you love him and that he's been on your mind
Tell him that you need your brother
Ask him how he's doing and say you been doing fine
If it comes a point where you just don't know what to say
While you still have him on the line, just say...

[Chorus]
We'll be, brothers forever
What happens to one of us, happens to us together
And we'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever
So you know, you know, you know, you know

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (High, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for, fire)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (I'm on fire)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar]
It's a secret society
Oh yes, It's drugs (Oh yes, It's drugs)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl Riri now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna, Rihanna]
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby
Snippet

[Chorus]
Said lil' mama got that ass tat' on each side
When I pull up, make her legs do the peace sign
Fuck me good and then I
Has it started or is it already over?
The way you looked at me made me want to believe
That there's something

Take me to bed and do the things that we said we wouldn't do
But what can you do when it's too hard not to

It's heavy and it's light as air
You know it, I've seen how you stare
You're giving me something rare
Oh, how it's been fueling my flare
How beautiful to really care

Lie down on that bed of clouds, I wanna come down from spinning round
Standing too close to fire, wanna play it cool but also wanna get higher
I'll be there for you whatever you wanna do
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, let's do it right this time

It's heavy and it's light as air
You know it, I've seen how you stare
You're giving me something rare
Oh, how it's been fueling my flare
How beautiful to really care
You didn't teach me, I taught myself through you
You didn't heal me, but I healed from the things that you do
We didn't want each other, baby, we wanted something so much more
To feel the rarest of feelings that which opens all doors
Don't shut them all too quickly, there might not always be more
I'll spread your love so thickly so I can reminisce some more

Even if we're done for
Even if it's really sore
I'll take it all, take it all, take it all

Sometimes it feels like I could give it all up to be held by you
But that's not all the time, no, not all the time

Only when I can't breathe
Only when I wanna believe
Only when it's late at night
Only when I don't feel right
Only when I touch my body
Only when I'm feeling naughty
Only when you're far away, far away, far away
Only when I can't breathe
Only when I wanna believe
Only when it's late at night
Only when I don't feel right
Only when I touch my body
Only when I'm feeling naughty
Only when you're far away, far away, far away
I dance with myself, like there is nobody else in the world
I fall to the floor and I fill the whole room with salty tears
I swim out of the window and into the night
I am smiling, I am screaming, I am glowing from inside
Do I dare to feel this feeling?

Oh how you looked at me like you'd forgotten why we're here
Where we're going, what it all means
It might all mean nothing, but you mean something to me

I squeeze a little tighter and suddenly, I'm holding my own body
There's an empty space whеre you once offerеd yourself to me

My mom knows I'll be alright, but she'll be glad I'm home
She's always casting spells for me
Keeping guard for me, working hard for me

I swim out of the window and into the night
I am smiling, I am screaming, I am glowing from inside
Do I dare to feel this feeling?
Sweet talking my way through another funny day
I'm not here in the first place, I've been replaced
Haven't quite met this new self of mine, tell me it'll all be fine
Tell me I don't need to say the lines

I'm fine getting stoned alone, with all of this time
Maybe I'll finally be mine

Dressing myself for the day, like I'm on my way to the grand parade
I catch my eye in the mirror and smile back at myself
Openеd up some boxes that are fillеd with pieces of me
All of those years trying to squeeze into boxes that didn't fit all of me

I realize what it all means when I'm looking into mother's eyes
I'm looking into mother's eyes

I'm sitting in the corner of my mind
I don't mean to sit here so much of the time
Tears rolling, I'm shaking, but I'm fine
I'll be running into you all the time
I want you, but I don't want you to be mine
I want you, but I don't want you to be mine
Feels like the paradox of my life
Feels like I'll get there one step at a time
We've been balancing on the finest line
Loving you's the cure and the crime
Loving you's the cure and the crime
The words are there, they're knocking at our teeth
I'm feeling bare and hot head to feet
I've got nowhere to go and no one to meet

I see it now, I see my heart beat
I see it now, I see what I need
To be sitting in the corner of my mind
To be sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Sitting in the corner of my mind
Be brutally honest, be brutally honest to me
With my whole world as your witness, lay it all on me
I don't want you to hold back any little thing
I'm ready to have my heart broken

I'll blow wind in your sails, I'll even walk you to the door
But please tell me what you really think, what you really think
I think I need your words to feel like daggers in this love
For only then could I give up the hope in my heart
For each time that I try to put out my hope
A little flame lingers and I'm back on your door
So be brutally honest to me, baby, I know you can
It'll help me to get out whilе I still can

How to get out of love
How to get out of lovе
How to get out of love
How to get out of love

I'll blow wind in your sails, I'll even walk you to the door
But please tell me what you really think what your really think
Of me, of me
How to get out of love
How to get out of love
How to get out of love
As if it wasn't hard enough

I guess I'm just a little drunk on a tiny piece of hope
And I wonder if it'll ever really go away
When you were dreaming I looked in, I saw everything
I saw fresh new grass, that's growing, it's growing
You've got a big, big heart, it's showing, it's showing
I never knew you like that, it's something quite special
I'm addicted to getting on your level
Never wanted to make it all blue
I just wanted to get into bed
I'm walking through the sweet sweet memories, I keep for nights
When I can't sleep, I remember all the times we loved
I remember all the places we could only go, just you and I
Lovers by night, but when the day came, we were back to the same
I'm a lover, I feel it now
I'm a lover, just never knew how
But now I got there, I'm a lover
So let me love you, whatever the weather
Mm, you're trouble
Mm, it's trouble, but it bubbles right over
And makes me feel over the moon
You make me feel over the moon
You making me feel over the moon
You make me feel over the moon
I'm a lover, I feel it now
I'm a lover, just never knew how
But now I got there, I'm a lover
So let me love you
Wake up, I'm right here
Been howling at you dear
A volcano erupted and the stars fell one by one
And finally I'm done right and it's a kite trapped in my mind
But I don't mind
I think of your hands on my body and they feel nice
Just one more night
And there's love pouring out my eyes and onto your plate
We've got it mighty fine, whenever we like
There's a velvet kind of mood
And the pleasure's like pudding and I'm winning and I'm sinning
Take a page from my dream that I'm living, I'm spinning
Thе world it keeps on turning
The world it keeps on turning
So tender, I'm еnded
Surrendered to you
So tender, I'm ended
Surrendered to you
I ache for you, but it doesn't paint me blue
I can't help thinking about all of the perks of loving you
Even if I have to hold this love alone until it passes through
I keep thinking about all of the work I had to do
But it all fades away to nothing when I think of you

I'm sick with love, it's got me where it hurts
Got struck from above, if only these things worked
If only these things worked

I can't help thinking about all of the perks of loving you
Even if I have to hold this love alone until it passes through
I keep thinking about all of the work I had to do
But it all fades away to nothing when I think of you
Yeah, it all fades away to nothing when I think of you

Would it be alright if we sat side by side and didn't say a single word?
Just let ourselves drown in the sweet sunny silence
And maybe we'd just know why it can't be so

I can't help thinking about all of the perks of loving you
Even if I have to hold this love alone until it passes through
I keep thinking about all of the work I had to do
But it all fades away to nothing when I think of you
Yeah, it all fades away to nothing when I think of you
It just fits so good, it just works so right
It just fits so good, it just works so right
Like you could never hold me tight, tight enough, yeah
Like you could never hold me tight, tight enough, yeah
It just fits so good, it just works so right
Like you could never hold me tight, ight enough, yeah

I ache for you
I ache for you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Head spinnin' like revolvin' doors
Jaws droppin', watch 'em hit the floor
Ain't even fair, no point in keepin' score
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
One, two, three, I'ma show you how you can count on me
Talk is cheap, so I'ma let all my actions speak, yeah
Centerfold, baby, goin' vogue, crazy
Rock and roll, you're my rollin' stone, baby

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice (Oh-oh)
How you don't go nowhere without going unnoticed (Oh-oh)
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Head spinnin' like revolvin' doors

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Hey, mami, that's my baby
That's my best friend (That's my best friend)
I hear you callin', see you ringing from your left hand (Brr-brr)
Locked it down when you wanted, that hopeless romance (Uh)
This happened so fast, I love it when we slow dance
You can break it down, you don't need a pole
I'm so proud of you, I bust you down in rose gold
Don't be ashamed, girl, I messed around, you messed up too
It all changed when you took my name and went insane, mmm

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Lil Uzi Vert]
Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice
How you don't go nowhere without going unnoticed
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused (Focused)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Lil Uzi Vert]
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go (Yeah)
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
There she go, lookin' like a shinin' star now (Woah)
I'm takin' time out just to figure out your heart now (Woah)
I'm feelin' different every time I hear your heart pound (That sound)
Automatic lovin' when we make them car sounds
I'ma beep-beep, go fast, I can't park 'round (Yeah)
Nobody that don't respect late-night talks and all sounds (Ayy, ayy)
That's from the Skybounds, I'm a good guy now (Huh, what?)
I'm no dog, no, no, I am no hound (No hounds)
Your beauty brighter than the light, like what is dark now? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
From dedication, I can't lie, it made you smart now (Yeah)
I took my shot and yeah, I missed, but got the rebound (Yeah)
Diamond so-so cool, got you high now (Ayy)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Lil Uzi Vert]
(There she go) Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Ayy, woah)
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go (Ayy)
Hands in the air, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go (Damn, uh)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Every day, reminded how much I hate it
Weighed it against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with the gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones arе
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rathеr not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
This part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
Part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One, then multiplies 'til you can taste the sun
And burned by the sky you try to take it from
But if it falls, there's no place to run
Crumbling down, it's so unreal
They're dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again, to places you've been
And bending your will 'til it breaks you, within
And still, they fill their eyes
With the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad with the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my drеaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you'rе heartless, take apart this
In the darkness, but I know that I've tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I've looked down the line
And what's there is not what ought to be
Held back by the battles they fought for me
Calling me to be part of their property
And now, I see that I get no chance
I get no break
Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And as the tightrope within slowly starts to thin
I can only hope that they close their eyes
To the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad to the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness, but I know that I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 1: Jake]
Got a big head but I used to think you were pretty cool
Shot weddings just to get yourself into a new apartment
Threw a tiki party in '18
Got fucked up and smoked cigs on the porch for hours
Made friends with a few friends of yours
I wouldn't talk to them if it was any other situation
Heard your partner's got the hots for Dave
Cool, you love her but you should probably just rethink that
You should probably just rethink that

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Rock a winter pair of flip flops
Dropped my drink at the Japanese drugstore
What's the first rule of fight club?
Sipping gin at the Vali-Hi Drive-in, oh

[Chorus: Jake]
Thank god for all the Christian mothers
I've been busy sweating undеr the covers of lovers
I'da been you if I wasn't anothеr
Hot shot with the camera is filming my sex tape
I'm probably gonna win at Sundance
Get big just to reinvent myself
Meet up in our hometown, slow down
Hot shot with the camera is filming my sex tape

[Post-Chorus]
Is filming my sex tape
Would you film my sex tape?

[Verse 2: Jake]
Sorry, dude, but the skate park's full
Used to cut your teeth with the family
It was real when you drove me back from the bar
Got real weird when you made a move on my sister
You made friends with a few friends of mine
You wouldn't talk to them if it was any other situation
Heard you've been getting by all right
Wish you the best and I genuinely mean that
I'm sorry about the diss track, but I genuinely mean that

[Chorus: Jake]
And thank god for all the Christian mothers
I've been busy sweating under the covers of lovers
I'da been you if I wasn't another
Hot shot with the camera is filming my sex tape
Probably gonna win at Sundance
Get big just to reinvent myself
Meet up in our hometown, slow down
Hot shot with the camera is filming my sex tape

[Outro: Whistler, Jake & Joseph Carl Hays]
And thank god for all the Christian mothers (Is filming my sex tape)
I've been busy sweating under the covers of lovers (Would you film my sex tape?)
I'da been you if I wasn't another (I'd film your sex tape)
Hot shot with the camera is filming my sex tape (I'd film your sex tape)
Probably gonna win at Sundance (I would)
Get big just to reinvent myself
Meet up in our hometown, slow down
Hot shot with the camera is filming my sex tape
(Ah, fuck!)

[Verse 1]
Oh, darlin', there's not much that you can say
To stop me from fallin' in like I am
Oh, darlin', even waves can't wash away
Our names in the sand, never could, never can

[Pre-Chorus]
You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know you're the one

[Chorus]
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I lеarned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Somе people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime

[Verse 2]
Oh, darlin', there's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darlin', I would walk that broken road
Time and time again if it led me to your hello

[Pre-Chorus]
You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know you're the one

[Chorus]
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime

[Outro]
Baby, you are a lifetime

Plan a motherfuckin’ wedding (Damn papa)
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring, put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you’re a one in a million
There ain't no man–

And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

[Chorus]
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

[Riff]
Send your location, come through
Send your location, come through

[Outro]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Verse]
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your levеl
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting likе I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

[Riff]
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Like you, ooh
Send your location, come through

[Bridge]
Rare breed, 'paring, scary
Found him, ho know, sharing
Parents, Paris, wedding
Marry, merry, ready

[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Riff]
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life (Keep my cool)
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day (Real life made for each other)

[Outro]
Why can't I find no one like you?
Why can't I find no one like you?

[Verse 1]
You can force it but it will not come
You can force it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying...

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

[Verse 2]
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it – you can break all the rules
All of the rules!
But still...

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken
Everyone is, everything is...

[Outro]
Why can't you forget?
Why can't we forget?
Why can't you forget?

"Thanks..."
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is winding low
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesomе, I could cry

[Intro]
Pickin’ cherries, cream and peaches
Problems vary, it tastes sweeter when it goes down, down

[Chorus]
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down, down
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down, down
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)

[Verse 1]
I got this thing about it
Oh boy I had to sing about it
They say this apple don’t fall far from the tree
Gotta tell me not to think about it, hey

[Verse 1]
All summer we hung round'
On the streets of our hometown
Dreamed about us getting close
Dressing in your wedding clothes
All summer it went on
We got Kings of Leon on
Got me in a tripped-out haze
Busy hours turned into days, we were (oh)

[Chorus]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
I got drunk and took too much
Love is a lethal drug

[Verse 2]
All summer we belong to the way we let it on
Feeling slowly sinking in, lying back and watching heaven spin
In my head the parrot saw
Biomorphic thick in the stars
I don't know what else to win
Just give mе one, give me onе more hit (oh)

[Chorus]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
Fell down and picked it up
Love is a lethal star
I just can't give you up, but you're coursing through my blood
I just couldn't get enough, love is a lethal drug
Love is a lethal drug

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Just went up in smoke 

[?]
Are we in love with another dose?
I soar when my body floats
Love in a lethal dose
Love in a lethal dose, yeah
Love in a lethal dose

[Intro: Charli XCX]
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
I ain't got it

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I don't know why I got a tendency to run away
Don't know why I'm always pushing for a sweet escape
Even though I feel so close, I just can't control how I feel
And I gotta be free, need to breathe

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
But sometimes I need all night, all day
We could fall in love in new shapes
New shapes
And when the morning comes
I'm sorry, I stayed
Tell you honestly, I can't change, can't change

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

[Verse 2: Christine and the Queens]
What if I created places for you to let go?
What if you wanted to watch because we both know?
That now we are so close
We don't have to fight how we feel
When the lights and the skins arе cold

[Pre-Chorus: Christine and the Queens]
I surrender to it all night, all day (All night, baby)
Then wе fall in love in new shapes (New shapes, baby)
New shapes
Then the morning comes all misty, we fade (Misty, baby)
'Cause we fell in love in new shapes (What?)
In new shapes, oh

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Christine and the Queens]
What you want
I ain't got it (Got it)
What you want (We could go on)
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

[Bridge: Caroline Polachek]
Thinkin' of me, but you're stuck on the west side again
Maybe we're meant for another dimension, babe
Deep in the dark of your brain like a star in space
You call it art, but you pulled on my heart
And you twisted it into a new shape
Yeah, I'm dive bar-ing again and again
Trying to get up close to you
Fucked if I know how it's gonna end
But honestly, life would be better if I never
Met you in the first place

[Chorus: Charli XCX, Christine and the Queens & Caroline Polachek]
What you want (Oh)
I ain't got it (Yeah)
What you want (I ain't got it)
What you want
I ain't got it (Charli, Caroline, Chris)
What you want (What you want, what you want)
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want (Ah-ha, ha, yeah)
What you want
I ain't got it (I ain't got it, baby)
I ain't got it

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead wеight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spicе Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, baby; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Intro]
May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a White person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her butt worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
We ain't nothing but mammals -- well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other rappers open like antelopes
But if we can kill animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

[Hook x2]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do; so he sucks and so do you
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
This woman put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download an audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you made the whole world garbage to me
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups,]all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

[Hook x2]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
Every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go

[Hook]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Damn it, let’s all stand up

[Chorus 2x]
Back in the building, took the elevator
We made it to top and the creator
Back on the scene, checking up on the dream
Everybody out here being a human being

[Verse 1]
Tryna get the feels, tryna get the bills
I get you when you hustle gold
Silver spoons, wishes and booze
Dig at me if I pray to God
I'm the bad, I'm the good, I'm the ugly
In society, a variety
If you want tea then I got plenty
Expressing, pressing reality
I got moves, I'm moving all the time
I got moves, I'm moving all the time
I got moves, I'm moving all the time
I got moves, making moves all the time
I just keep it moving
People, are you ready?
I just keep it moving

[Chorus 2x]
Back in the building, took the elevator
We made it to top and the creator
Back on the scene, checking up on the dream
Everybody out here being a human being

[Verse 2]
Freedom of speech, what the schools teach
M.I.A be preaching now, world town reach
Dark skin on beach, I don't use no bleach
Driving in the street, and my BM goes screech
Rendez-vouz in Greece, they wanna get a piece
A modern day 

[Tolstoy] I give them War & Peace
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six
Why you gotta fuck with me just to be a bih?
Sita and Bhagwan 50/50 mix
Mystic, gangsta you should take a trip
World Town intelligence, here for justice
If you try to break me, you better practice

[Chorus 2x]
Back in the building, took the elevator
We made it to top and the creator
Back on the scene, checking up on the dream
Everybody out here being a human being

Yeah, uh, I'm out here still, oh, yeah
They call my phone, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay, yeah, wait a, yeah, uh

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I'm out here still, you cannot live how I live
You cannot feel what I feel
Told lil' shawty to chill, she sayin' that she love me
No, she love these one hundred bills
I'm out here still, so I do not know how to feel
Bitch, the fuck how you feel?
And that's the death of me, yeah, if it's more than it's meant to be, yeah

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, fifteen runnin' the race on my own
And that's why shawty keep callin' my phone
Beggin', oh, beggin' on me to come over
Can not trust none of these gangs 'cause they on one
My mother beggin' me to come home
It's been a while since I slept sober
Nowadays I just wanna be alone
It's been a while since my mouth is sober
They tell me I deal with the pain so well
Soon as I win I say nothing, I won't tell
I told lil' shawty come through to the hotel
They just won't numb the pain forever, oh well
Feelin' with demons, emotions in my mind
It's nothing new, I had it my whole life
My biggest enemy was me the whole time
I realize that the world is all mine

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I'm out here still, you cannot live how I live
You cannot feel what I feel
Told lil' shawty to chill, she sayin' that she love me
No, she love these one hundred bills
I'm out here still, so I do not know how to feel
Bitch, the fuck how you feel?
And that's to the death of me, yeah, if it's more than it's meant to be, yeah

[Verse 2: LB Spiffy]
Babygirl it wasn't meant to be
All of these bitches wanna come get next to me
Me and LAROI cooking up the recipe
We want them bad bitches up in Tennessee
We couldn't turn, sippin' off the Hennessy
I got nothin' fit for me, so just let me be
I'm in my zone, when I be in my remedy
I just might link up that thot up in Kennedy
Uh, uh, I just wanna hit through my nose, yeah
Couple bitches that be callin' my phone
But they just wan' come and smoke on my dope, yeah
I do not care what my ex bitch told you

I don't even gotta sip on no wine
'Cause I make her whine like she my controller, she my controller

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Told lil' shawty to chill, she sayin' that she love me
No, she love these one hundred bills
I'm out here still, so I do not know how to feel
Bitch, the fuck how you feel?
And that's to the death of me, yeah, if it's more than it's meant to be, yeah
I'm out here still, you cannot live how I live
You cannot feel what I feel
Told lil' shawty to chill, she sayin' that she love me
No, she love these one hundred bills
I'm out here still, so I do not know how to feel
Bitch, the fuck how you feel?
And that's the death of me, yeah, if it's more than it's meant to be, yeah

[Verse 1]
No one ever saw me cry
Until I left the party the other night
Do you remember all the things that you said to me?
That came out of his mouth automatically

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm so used to saying
"I’m fine"
And then something that you did to hurt me worse, it comes to me
Despite (Those times)
One day I just wanna hear you say
"I like you"

[Chorus]
What's stopping you? (Hey)
Ah, what's stopping you?
What’s stopping you?
Ah, what's stopping you?

[Verse 2]
Wish I could go back to lying beside you on the bed
Why'd you, oh, why'd you break it off? (What's stopping you?)
I lie here thinking 'bout every bad mistake I've madе
Why'd you, oh, why’d you break it off?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I’m so used to saying
"I'm fine"
And thеn something that you did to hurt me worse, it comes to me
Despite (Those times)
One day I just wanna hear you say
"I like you"

[Chorus]
What’s stopping you? (Hey)
What's stopping you?
Ah, what's stopping you?
(Why'd you, oh, why’d you break it off?)
What's stopping you?
(What's stopping you?)
(Why'd you, oh, why'd you break it off?)

[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?

[Verse 1]
You cut the cord and you let me go
Clean break, so professional
When I mouth, I'm the last to know
Saying, “It's not me, it's you”
Textbook how you're actin' out
I knew you would come around
Tables turned, oh, it's funny how, baby
It's not me, it's you

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
Be a great man, leave your ego at the door
Tell me what you're really, really comin' herе for
What you gon' do for that la-la-la?

[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hеy, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?

[Verse 2]
How you likin' the way it feels?
My hand on the steering wheel
No, I never got ya so revealed
I play your game so well
Can't say that I blame ya now
If I was you, I'd be breaking down
Tables turned, got me laughing how
I play your game so well

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
Be a great man, leave your ego at the door
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
What you gon' do for that la-la-la?

[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?

[Bridge]
You must take me for a fool
(Baby, get on your knees and beg me for it)
It's fun to mess with you
(Baby, get on your knees and beg me for it)

[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it

[Intro]
I'm a zoo girl
Straight out the Wild Wild East
I’m good, bad, I'm the ugly
I'm a do-gal
Make a dream come true
Wrap an arm round you like a bangal
Keep it hot, keep it humble
Hums to the jungle
Causing a rumble
See me in the rubble of a Hubble telescope
Bringing scope to these heavens (brrrr!)

[Verse 2]
In my own space
My own fucking race
An alien bringing unity in your face
Tell me about your life
Tell me about your wife
Tell me about your trouble and strife
Tell me why you cry, tell me why you lie
Things you’vе tried and how you stay fly
I'll be therе, not cold like ice
I done already paid that price

[Pre-Chorus]
Ola everybody
Even at the ones that fight me
And everybody is a

[Verse 2]
This time I'm gonna have way more bite
Put a voice to the mic, make a beat real tight
I still got fight, I still got vision
I still got sight, my brain's still bright
Running on full or running on a track
Running like a tiger, I'm bringing stuff back
Earn that credit when thing go brat
I’m that bitch and that’s that fact
If you want the sauce then I got it on tap
Don't be messing with my blessing when I got it like that
A mind full of traps that’s set for the packs
Clearer than snakes that's hidden in the hatch
Wild Wild East, North, South and West
If you need a rider than ya looking at the best (best, best, best)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ola everybody
Even loving the ones that fight me
And everybody is a

Calling a rebel down to the floor

[Chorus]
Out of the jungle, into the street
Manifest that best life, turn up the heat
Tight is this beat, and nature and weed
Staying up all night, we got what you need
Sneakers and speakers, mountains and skaters
Riding the wave, we extreme surfers
Facing ourselves, living life with a purpose
If we get it wrong, then God only help us

[Hook]
All of them boys, and all of them girls
All of the diamonds, all of them pearls
All of the animals, all of the birds
All of the beings in all of the worlds
All of the timе I'm flipping the norm
Riding the thunder, riding thе storm
Staying on top and staying on form
Staying in tuned and staying informed

[Bridge]
Let's not make humanity too dumb
A rock star I be dialing up outcome
A mystic gangster, I just wanna have fun
If I take you places then I think you should comе

[Refrain]
Out of the jungle, into the street
Out of the jungle, into the street
Out of the jungle, into the street
Staying up all night, we got what you need
Facing ourselves living life with a purpose
Facing ourselves living life with a purpose
Facing ourselves living life with a purpose
If we get it wrong, then God only help us

[Hook]
All of them boys and all of them girls
All of the diamonds, all of them pearls
All of the animals, all of the birds
All of the beings in all of the worlds
All of the time we're taking it home
Lighting the cone and lighting the dome
Staying strong and making it grown
Taking a turn to turning it on

[Bridge]
Let's not make humanity too dumb
A rock star I be dialing up outcome
A mystic gangster, I just wanna have fun
If I take you places then I think you should come
All the time I'm flipping the norm, it's on
Riding the thunder, riding the storm, it's on
Staying on top and staying on form
Staying in tuned and staying informed

[Chorus]
Out of the jungle into the street
Manifest that best life, turn up the heat
Tight is this beat and nature and weed
Staying up all night, we got what you need
Sneakers and speakers mountains and skaters
Riding the wave we extreme surfers
Facing ourselves living life with a purpose
If we get it wrong, then God only help us

Part I - No More Parties

[Intro]
I can tell, yeah
Mmm, it's us

[Verse]
I can tell niggas jelly by the way they look
Pray to God my Glock don't jam, Lord knows I don't hook
Pull up and I made ya look
Pockets full of Oregon ducks
Click on smart shooters, stick on him while readin' books
Free my nigga out the cell, he is not a crook
He just got some crooked ways, but I think they shook
Why they wanna hate me? Prolly 'cause I made ten million as a baby
No new friends, no
Same ones that I been with
2020 been shit, huh, I'll advance it
We don't do no mm- public transit
When I throw the tangent, mm
Pussy niggas sayin' shit, same shit that got yo' mans hit
I can't stand it, really with some rich bandits
Put like fifty thousand inside some toast and madе a sandwich
Call my phone like a sex ho, if it's 'bout thе cream just like Maxo
Caught lookin' like that and get yo' back broke
Fine as a motherfucker was
Skip the games, baby, can I fuck?
I walk around with these racks on me (Yeah)
Stick and my Ricks, we gon' tax homie, yeah
I just want some mouth, don't try to latch on me
I don't wear Amiri's, Carhartt slacks on me
Why these niggas still poor?
It's 2021, we can all score, for real
Part II - Beat Box

[Intro]
It's us
Damn E, this shit exclusive
Us

[Verse]
Thuggin' in my Reeboks
Ten milli', big Glocks, huh
In a big truck, fuck around, make your ears pop
Fuck with me, gang'll do some' to you, make your tears drop
Hit 'em off, Wafi only boy, I don't Sears shop
Fuck around, might move to Michigan and get my peers hot
Trustworthy, uh, I think not, we'll wipe snot
Three lines, gon' make it look like wine in a clear pot
Ride around with the same weapon, ain't get deer shot
No rearviews in my life, leave that shit behind me
I was only eighteen years old when Kanye tried to sign me
Niggas gangsters online 'til you see 'em named Mahatma Gandhi
Better tell my bitch, "Let's get a bitch that's tatted like Kehlani"
If she tell me yes, I'll let you know the when and where's to find me
Niggas already thinkin' that they wildin', steady tryna guide me
Finna blind me, standin' in my way, they need to get behind me
Every day I ride with a rocket just like my first name Johnny
White diamonds got more colors than a Murakami
Bitch thought I was Japanese, I folded just like origami
Used to sleep in front of Shoney's, now I got an eighty-inch Sony
Rich as hell, used to be broke, fucked up, eatin' bologna
Niggas not like us, we get to the money
How the fuck we wipe his nose and we still left it runnin'?
How you fly with nothin' to your name? Man, you niggas bummin'
'Member tryna get kids to game, they ain't listen to me

[Outro]
Oh well
It's us

[Verse 1]
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes opеn, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' vеry loose pants, yeah
Buried a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower

[Hook 1]
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

[Verse 2]
By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

[Verse 3]
Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin MAC-11s with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya
(I can't hear ya)
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya
Shit

[Verse 4]
The Magic Johnson of the game
These lames don't want to play with me
Smile on your face, but I really know you hatin' me
I know you mad, cause I'm sick, and it's plain to see
It's me

[Hook 2]
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Nutmeg, sweet sweet Nutmeg
On the 25th I'm cover you with
My nutmeg, ooh, my sweet brown nutmeg
Girl, don't make me beg
I want to nog your egg, yes I do

Girl, I'm going to rock you like a cradle
You lick the nutmeg off my ladle
It's pure, it's refined
And it's ready to grind

It's my nutmeg, you need my nutmeg
I'll sprinkle your Christmas cream with my spice supreme

What about allspice?
You know it leaves me cold as ice
Cinnamon?
Don't even think of putting that stuff in
Cardamom?
That won't let me drop my love bomb
No cocoa, no cloves, no vanilla, no mace
The only residue I want you wiping off your face is my nutmeg
Ooh ooh ooh, nutmeg
You'll be happy that you ate it, yes you will
So just grab my seed and grate it
It's my nutmeg, my nutmeg
Na na na na na na na, nutmeg, ooh my nutmeg

[Verse 1]
Let's sit around and drink some saké
Then we can argue 'bout the same things
Talk about neighbors on our front porch
I wonder if they know we're moving
Hope they don't know my landlord personally
'Cause I never told him you moved in with me
But fuck him, he kept my money

[Verse 2]
I think your sisters are so pretty
Got drunk and they forgot they met me
I made her laugh one time at dinner
She said I'm funny and then I thanked her
But I know I'm funny haha

[Verse 3]
We go through phases when we're over ours
Right now we both wanna be rockstars
Got you a bass last year on your birthday
The same one the guy from Linkin Park plays
But you look better with it anyways

[Verse 1]
You came here to welcome me
To what is the end
You said if we weren't in love
We'd still be best friends
We both tell the same jokes
Over and over
Wonder if we'll get married
Before my brother

[Chorus]
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me

[Verse 2]
I like your songs even though
They're not about me
Sometimes I'm scared to show my dad
'Cause you're always cussing

[Chorus]
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to me

[Instrumental]

Won't you tell me you love me?
Won't you tell me you love me?
Won't you tell me you want me?
Am I running in the right direction
Count everything, I won't be mine
Is this a hard day for perfection
And am I gonna get it right

It feels like a breath
But I'm scared of no one met myself
I'm falling of a hill
Is this my cry for help

I feel it coming
But I stand my ground
Find ahead of
Where my heart's still bound

Hold my head of
As the tears go down
Am I wrong here
I'm gonna stand my ground

(any?) love's (incarceration??)
Being alone just passes time
Is this a wasted education
Am I destined for a life of crime
It feels like a breath
But I'm scared of no one met myself
I'm falling of a hill
Is this my cry for help

I feel it coming
But I stand my ground
Find ahead of
Where my heart's still bound

Hold my head of
As the tears go down
Am I wrong here
I'm gonna stand my ground
Stand, stand, stand, stand my ground
Stand, stand, stand, stand my ground

I've learned I've heard from my (sins/sounds??)
I've tried
I'm prisoned and now I'm me

I feel it coming
But I stand my ground
Find ahead of
Where my heart's still bound
Hold my head up
As the tears go down
Am I wrong here

I'm gonna stand my ground
Stand, stand, stand my ground
Stand, stand, stand my ground
Stand, stand, stand my ground
Stand, stand
I'm gonna stand my ground
Dear summer
Yeah, suffix people, you know, you, you
You already, yeah, come on
Kickin rocks on the block tellin all the old g's
I be coming for your spot when your not looking
Hot cooking momma got it on the kitchen table
I thank god we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when good grades came through

Then the cooked k's came through
Some soft some stepped on but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights thought I hеard
Niggas coming thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreaming, then I wokе, the junkies was still feenin
N I had coke so I had hope u may say that is wrong
But I ain't talkin to ya child I'm talkin to this song

I'm just doing the walk down memory lane
If I crash just pick up my brain
And yes, my nikkas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do then I'm the nikka u blame
So I shoot first anyway
And I would do the honors anyday
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the state like I whip through the a
Show ya ass how to take 4 and get 8
And it don't take 4 nikkas to get straight
The only hot boy even off this plate
Young weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the innerstate
Stop working with that thinner weight
Get ya breaks fixed
Stop playin, cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon be empty
When the stomachs get empty anythings tempting

Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kid's sake
Hurricane wipe the south like a earthquake
We tryna save face but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate, we on our way pussies
Relocate
Ya'll know us, when you see us put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up

It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good nikka, think about the hood nikka...
The people who ain't, never had shit, ain't gon neva have shit
Bullshit cause they still gon try to manage
Nikkas doin anything
Like god gon understand them
But please understand us, nikkas with money lost mansions
Nikkas with nothing lost families
Lives lost in traffic, water up to the attic
There goes the stashes
But a nikka got passion
Even though the bounce back seeming like magic
Shit, but call me sick freak
Watch how I turn one k to a hundred g's
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze

Summer please know I live for ya
Throw on the wifebeater, let back the lid for ya
A few years I prolly hear from ya
But now I'm here for ya
I know nikkas that shed a tear for ya
Behind bars tryna get to ya
They prolly never see ya
It's that real talk if you ever heard it homie

Shit hurt so much might have to hurt ya homie
No commercial no frontin no curve on it
No cut, tell life so what
The drought's in not only white slowed up
The weed slowed up we can't even roll up
Fuck, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what, how we getting on
Where he sittin at, what he sittin on
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world comin' and my city the proof
There, and this is after disaster, this ain't rap dis a recap
Stepping off the g4 still strapped

Bust ya head in the air that's a skycap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollas
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon eat, then everyone eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reach

And I'm a get death through these balls, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even, when everything paused
I proceeded
I'm a leader, meet the son of jacida
Fuck the world not the people, there

[Verse]
I can see it in your eyes, you angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Oh Katy, oh Noah, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? (I did)
Yeah, I made it (Oh)
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, huh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, huh-huh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, huh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Take a shot for me

[Intro]
I haven't been waiting for this my whole life
I’ve been preparing
GRAMMYs, welcome to Planet Her
Day to night to morning
Keep with me in the moment
Didn't even notice
Got to keep me fo—

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you (Fell in love)
You ain’t coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I’ll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
(Before I leave you dry)

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I’d let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn’t even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say s—
Oh, ah, ay, (why) why don't you say s—
(Hey, hey, why don't you), yeah, say so

[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this
He ain’t ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my a—
(Why you actin' like you shy?)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them — hating I have you with me
All of my — sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty

[Chorus]
Day to niiight (to morning, keep with me in the moment)
(I'd let you had I known it), why don't you say sooo?
(Didn't) even notice, no punches left to roll with
You focused, (you got to keep me focused); you want it? Saaaay
Day to night to morning (Why don't you say?), keep with me in the moment (Why don't you say?)
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
(Day to niiight) Didn't even notice, (To morning) no punches left to roll with
(You known it) You got to keep me focused; (You want it saaaaay) you want it? Say so

[Chorus: Joba]
A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I know my sweat like cologne; see, this house ain't like home
If I could swallow my pride, would you admit when you wrong?
I know it's easy to just skip it, flippin' out, and you gone
Maybe I wouldn't be so testy when you came for my glow
Got dinner on the kitchen table, make sure everyone know
I made my Sunday mornings feel like Friday nights
I feel like Boobie Miles under these Friday lights
Ready to pounce on any pussy-ass bitch come for my life (Pussy ass bitch)
I'm tired of validation
I'm tired of wonderin' what the fuck I gotta do to save you
You been in this shit for years, I can't be your savior
Had a speech with Satan; on my knees, I'm prayin'
Everything I say breakin' into—

[Chorus: Joba]
A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

[Verse 2: Joba]
I stay runnin' from somethin' I can't see
True colors blinding, fuck away from me
Gunnin' for somethin' I don't need
I lead two lives, find me
Who's to blame? Who's to say I leave?
Forced to change, forced to face my seed
Break a bit, breakin' in, timely
Good on my own, but I been feelin' alone
I gotta go, don't ask why
Watch the dominoes and the time fly
Either way, it goes, scribble out of line
Get the picture? Different from when I met you

[Chorus: Joba]
A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

[Bridge: Joba]
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

[Chorus: Joba & Matt Champion]
A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration (Pussy ass bitch)
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

[Verse: bearface]
Dear Lord
Lord, will You come down and help out my brother? Oh
So please Lord
He needs You more, oh
I want You to let him know that he's still loved (Still loved)
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight (Where do I go now?)
So God bless you love
Heal him with Your light
Oh, prayin' all the time to You
Show him to the light
Ooh, ooh, oh, hold him in Your light
Oh, hold him in Your light (Yeah)
Show him Your light, aw yeah (Oh, yeah)
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight
Waiting by Your side
He just needs Your love and Your light

[Intro: Joba]
The light

[Chorus: Joba]
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Sick of these niggas givin' me false info
Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chappelle Show
Bitch I can handle the truth
That's how I entered the booth
Look at all these bruises I got
It gave me so much confidence
Back when I was makin' songs at my momma's crib
The candle's lit, the temperature rising
What type of man can find the right time to fly in
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul
Should've protected all my opinions
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Kool-aid stands, band-aids wrapped around your beautiful hands
Protect me from the city
Couldn't save me from the world back then
Had Jeezy on repeat in your whip
No peace in my streets
And these days, no license
Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid, I always felt so frightened
My momma from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teachin' me how to learn to have empathy even when it burns
But I hate that you got me in this box expecting me to see the light
See the light, see the light
All my niggas to the right, right, right
You see the light, light, light, light
And all my niggas to the left, right
Left, right, left, right
You see the light, light, light, light, light, light

[Verse 2: Joba]
When that hammer pulled back, did you think of me?
You were the one that taught me how to be
Look at me now, in all my glory
Overcame a lot, that's a different story
Abandoned by the life-giver
Looking back at my life different
Deep cuts in the dusk of the final gasp before your life flashed
What happens when you die?
Does it fade black?
I sense you in my skin and the trucker cap
Miss it when we laughed
Didn't trust my intuition when I saw the cracks
I'm sorry
All I ever want to do is make you proud
Fleeting moments
Always found a way around the frown
Set aside the pain to celebrate the now
Couldn't kick me out the house, I was fucked up
Nothing to prove without doubt if I'm man enough
What's the use?
I could use you, 'cause I'm scared as fuck
Tuck me in
Always young enough to feel loved
And share some
Are you lookin' down?
Inner child reachin' out
Brittle-boned crying out
The past does not define you
The past does not define you
The burden was too much
Couldn't save you from yourself when you'd self-destruct
Couldn't save me from myself when I'd push my luck
To tell the truth I am just like you
Left it all in the pistol that you used
Always be your little man
Following your footsteps even though I'm mad
Even though you're gone you live on
And the day I have kids I'll tell them 'bout grandpa
And how great he is
And the grandkids
Grandkids you'll never meet
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be
Neither would they
It's safe to say I'll find a way out the darkness
The way you left Ma hits me the hardest
What a shame things change in the blink of an eye
Fade away, fast break to the depths in the sky
Impermanence turned permanent with a 9
That's life, that's life

[Chorus: Joba]
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it

[Part I: PRESSURE]

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Merlyn, Merlyn, Merlyn, Merlyn, Merlyn
Check, check, check, check
Pressure, pressure

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Pull up, skrrt, skrrt
Pick up, dessert
Telepathy, I don't say words
Best friend got lynched, I was on tour
We the Goodfellas, thirty deep at Coachella
How you know I changed? When the fuck was we familiar?
Diamond couch say, "Merlyn," yes, that's pressure
Very hard to sleep on like a skinny lover
Motherfuck what you think, I meant to upset you

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Pressure, pressure, prеssure, pressure (Apply thе pressure)
Pressure (Pressure), pressure (Pressure), pressure, pressure (Apply the pressure)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I believe that I won't fail (Uh)
Nigga like me done crawled out hell (Woop)
Niggas like me, they all in jail (Uh)
Luckily, I can pay my bail (Uh)
I don't even check my bills (Uh)
Came a long way from crushing pills (Uh)
It's some things that I conceal (Uh)
Y'all want clean, but I want real, real, real, real, real (Uh, uh, uh)
On your knees to be ideal, deal, deal, deal, deal (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

Pressure, pressure, yeah

[Part II: BOW WOW]

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & ssgkobe]
Me and my boys, we dressed like Bow Wow, keep it in my bag (Yeah, yeah, yeah, pressure, pressure, yeah)
Me and my boys, we stunt like Birdman, flexing like my dad
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys (Ooh)

[Verse: ssgkobe]
Off them drugs, I get too comfortable
I know they mad I'm up as fuck (Oh)
Woke up and my hair matted as fuck
Got a dinner to go to? Oh, damn, that's tough
In the hills with the gang where the valleys end
Bad bitch pull up, let the baddies in
Codeine and it's stuck in my abdomen
Yeah, I think I need a badder bitch (Mhm)
Yeah, I seen a stallion, she just walked in
Dilly-dallying to my new parked Benz
"Oh, damn? What he pull up in the airport in?"
I don't really think that fact is important
It's imported, yeah, it's a damn foreign
Hold on, what secret do Victoria got?
Balling hard like the Magic, now the sorcerers know
But I think it was me and my, me, it was, it was (Boys)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Me and my boys, we dressed like Bow Wow, keep it in my bag
Me and my boys, we stunt like Birdman, flexing like my dad
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys, boys, boys, boys

[Post-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Me and my boys, me and my boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys
That's me and my shawty, uh
Me and my shawty, uh
Me and my boys, that's me and my boys
Me and my boys, me and my boys
That's me and my shawty, uh
Me and my shawty
How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel to be where you are?
How far is the journey from here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?

[Verse 1]
Call, I'll wait
We blow, like trees
All, I want
Is someone to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
What is going on?
It's not you, it's not you, it's not me
What is going on?
It's not you, it's not you, it's just me
Me, me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
Say you, softly
Whispered, in my ear
"I'm so sorry
I'll always be here", yeah

[Chorus]
What is going on?
It's not you, it's not you, it's not me
What is going on?
It's not you, it's not you, it's - say it now
Me, ooh

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be
Lying anymore
It's impossible to fake this

[Chorus]
What is going on?
It's not you, it's not you, it's just me
What is going on?
It's not you, it's not you, it's just me
Me, me, ooh

[Outro]
Show me your hands motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Joan said something:
"Don't feel too bad being weird"
She said she and Bobby adieu
Were going home again
'Cause everyone around here is crazy
Everyone's a big 

[?]

Joan, wait
Sometimes just a little movement
Is all it takes, but
You'll go, wish you wouldn't leave me
I wish you didn't need a break, but okay

[Chorus]
Sometimes you just know
When it's your time to go
When you can't live any longer
And you can't do any more
And sometimes you're afraid, but you wish
You want me to promise, have a new song
And a prayеr

[Verse 2]
While the velvеteens are changing
There was something cold in the wind
Joan just kept on clueing
"When you try to dry, we may be friends again"
Even though she had a feeling that
Deep inside she somehow knew
The dog would never come back wailing, no
That was not the kinda thing he'd do

Joan's about telling me something uplifting
I'm so confused
Everyone around here in town is leaving
Now even you
Now even you

Last night, I said it to her, I said
"Please help me die"
Wrong hole I got born in
I know she never had what I want
She only want what's good for me
She might know by now
He just smiled from the stormy skies
"You'll figure it out, you'll figure it out"

[Chorus]
And I think that I know that it's my time to go
I can't wait any longer
And I can't do any more
Wheter I'm afraid, but you know I'm gonna leave anyway

[Intro: Joba, Matt Champion, JOBA & Kevin Abstract, Ryan Beatty]
Who's watching you?

Feel you in my bones, caught me through 

[?] (Do what you do, do what you do)
The feelings come and go, but are you in my phone? (But who's watching you? Who's watching you?)

Needed something more, needed something more (Well, alright)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon, Joba]
Hollow homes and broken hearts create a lost child
You try so hard to grow alone and find your own style
A world of feelings get buried beneath that fragile smile (Who's watching you?)
The people who put their hearts in you never stay a while (Who's watching you?)
It's hard to reconcile when you couldn't identify
Anxiety turned into rage because you couldn't cry
The truth transforms into a secret when you wouldn't lie
See it every time, let out a heavy sigh, and question why
I got it

[Verse 3: bearface, Matt Champion, Merlyn Wood, Joba]
Watching over me, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, na na na (Well, alright)
Watching over me, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, na na na
Call it

I give 

[?] on your set, on my denim paper red (Who's watching you? Who's watching you?)
When the fingers bloody red, use some lace to wash my hands
I can't promise

[Outro: bearface, Kevin Abstract, Joba, Ryan Beatty]
Watching over me, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, na na na (Who's watching you?) (Who's watching you?) (Who's watching you?) (Who's watching you?) (Who's watching you?) (Who's watching you?)
Watching over me, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, na na na
I know you gotta wait forever

Just give me a minute or two
I know you gotta wait forever
I know you gotta wait forever
Just give me a minute or two

[Verse 1]
I woke up in your bed
I can’t believe I did it again
Am I still drunk? My head’s a mess
I took you back, this never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Last time was the last time
Promise that I’d stay clear
And said “If last time was the last time
How did I end up here?" Yeah
Oh, and I know that I should say goodbye
Yeah, oh, and God knows I try, I try, and I try to

[Chorus]
Talk myself out of it (I just can’t)
Talk myself out of it (I tried to)
Talk myself out of it (But I just can’t)

Your body speaks, and mine replies
We conversate, our tongues are tied
And yeah I know, we’ll nevеr last
But I can’t leave when you touch likе that

[Pre-Chorus]
Last time was the last time
Promise that I’d stay clear
And said “If last time was the last time

[Verse 1]
Hard liquor, playing games
Just say my name, I wanna see you later
Pour me one, 'cause he fooled me twice
Push me down, I know I'm no better
I'm not here for ya, not here for ya
Not here for ya, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Huh, who do you think you are?
I've heard it all before, just let this bass-line roll
Who, just me and you?
I'll wait for tonight, while the strobe-lights so bright
Huh, who do you think you are?
I've heard it all before, just let this bass-line roll
Who, just me and you?
I'll wait for tonight, while the strobe-lights so bright

[Verse 2]
Hard liquor, playing games

Huh, who do you think you are?

Huh, who do you think you are?
I've heard it all before, just let this bass-line roll
Who, just me and you?
I'll wait for tonight, while the strobe-lights so bright
In the back of your mind it crawls
Sucking all of your life though tiny straws, ya dig?
Hoping all of what bends will break
Hoping all that you give is more than it will take

Let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn, let it burn
It’ll tear your core to shreds
It’ll tear your core to shreds

It has taken your will to think
Oh, it has taken your choice to stand real tall and speak up
It’ll lift you so high you’ll soar
Flying high enough you can’t see the ground no more

Let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn, let it burn
It’ll tear your core to shreds
It’ll tear your core to shreds

Tryna break these barricades
Oh, but the giant who holds them up won’t go away
So brick by brick it falls
With a barricade who needs shiny walls
Lеt it burn, let it burn
Let it burn, let it burn
It’ll tеar your core to shreds
It’ll tear your core to shreds
Defendant car dealer appealed an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied the dealer's petition to compel arbitration of plaintiff buyer's suit alleging violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), Civ. Code, §§ 1750-1784, and other consumer protection laws.

The arbitration provision allowed an appeal to a three-member panel of a monetary award exceeding $100,000, allowed appeal of an award of injunctive reliеf, required advance paymеnt of arbitral expenses on appeal, and exempted repossession from arbitration. The buyer stated in his declaration that he was not given an opportunity to read the contract and was not aware that it had an arbitration provision on the reverse side. The ADA defense lawyer court concluded that the arbitration provision was unconscionable under Civ. Code, § 1670.5, and could not be cured by severance. Thus, its enforcement was properly refused under Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281, 1281.2. The arbitration provision satisfied the two elements of procedural unconscionability, oppression and surprise, because the contract was one of adhesion and the buyer was not given an opportunity to read the provision. It was also substantively unconscionable because multiple aspects of the arbitration provision tilted it decidedly in favor of the dealer and caused it to be permeated by unconscionability. Moreover, injunctive relief from the arbitrator was inconsistent with the CLRA. Some of the offending clauses could not be cured by striking them.

The court affirmed the order.

Petitioner investors petitioned for a writ of mandate directing respondent trial court to set aside its order denying their motions to restore their lawsuit against real party in interest securities dealers alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion to the active civil trial calendar. The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Seven, denied the petition. The investors petitioned for review.

The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) was a self-regulatory organization that licensed and regulated broker-dealers in the national securities industry. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NASD had adopted a code of arbitration procedure to govern the arbitration of disputes between its members and their customers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved NASD's procedures. The court held that Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.85(a) authorized the California Judicial Council to adopt ethics standards for arbitrators appointed by arbitration providers, but it also held also that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 preempted § 1281.85(a) and the California Ethics Standards for Neutral Arbitrators in Contractual Arbitration (California Standards) for arbitrations administered by the subsidiary. In determining that the NASD Code should preempt the California Standards, the SEC acted within its authority, and its determination was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. A delay in arbitrator selection and appointment, resulting from uncertainty regarding the applicability of the California Standards, did not relieve the investors of their duty to arbitrate.

The appellate court's judgment was affirmed.

[Verse]
It's still okay to do nothing
It's still okay to stay in
It's still okay to waste the day away
And watch the same old shows again
If you see someone out there at some fancy restaurant
Well, it's still okay to do nothing if you want
Lyrics:

I don't know why I keep moving my body
I don't know if this is wrong or if it's right
I don't know if there's a beat, or something's taking over me
And I just know I'll feel so good tonight

I don't know what your name is but I like it
I've been thinking 'bout some things I wanna try
I don't know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
And I just know I'll feel so good tonight

Oh, if we keep on dancing
Take our rhythm to new heights
Feel the heat of passion, baby
Light up the night

(We could start a fire)
Come on, let it burn baby
(We could start a fire)
Let the tables turn baby
(We could start a fire)
I just know I feel so good
Don't you know I feel so good
I just know I feel so good
Tonight

I don't care if this tuns into a riot
Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor
Turn the music way up loud
Can't nobody stop us now
I just know I feel so good tonight
I just know I feel so good tonight

(We could start a fire)
Come on, let it burn baby
(We could start a fire)
Let the tables turn baby
(We could start a fire)

I just know I feel so good
Don't you know I feel so good
Don't you know, don't you know?
Tonight

[Verse 1]
Get a little drunk, get a little loud
Stupid me and my rebel mouth
Ain't all wrong but I ain't alright
Don't see the world in black and white
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
I never liked doing what I was told
Don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause I ain't walkin' in your shoes

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Verse 2]
And maybe he would sit awhile
And rendеr me an illegal smile
And I bеt that he would understand
Just how I feel and who I am

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

[Bridge]
And I play my life like truth or dare
I'm not all here but I'm all there, yeah
And all the colors people paint me
Don't they know they'll never change me, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't one to knock religion
Though it's always knockin' me
Always runnin' with the wrong crowd
Right where I want to be
And I ain't good at being careful
I just say what's on my mind
Like my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine
Yeah, my idea of heaven
Is to burn one with John Prine

Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 1: Kano]
Method to the Madness, attitude maverick
16's malice, inflict Damage
KA's land is, who the hell is Alice?
Goodies and baddies, city's too savage
Married to the game one calls for a family
And when we get together it's like Hussain... No
Vodka and cranberry, rave in a Mandy
House and garage, kid and candy
Prince in the Palace, siblings and families
Jack moves and O2, put your hands up
Foul-mouthed rappers, no fucking manners
Cockney rhyme and slanger's, sweet
Anti celebrity, anti-Britney
Anti anything, anti-us
Yo, yo, yo
It's Gorillaz on the beat
And Kano and Bashy are the illest on the street

[Chorus: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: MF DOOM & Bashy]
The flow is toe in, precision as an afro trim
All big letters but isn't no acronym
Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
DDT the first bar, leave the track back broken
Chrome grown men doing business with Anglo-Sax and them
Lacking swing so that banjo's so relaxing
As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind
Pretend it's just a pen, see if we can pencil 'em in
Tense, mention men of honour fenced in
Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end
Don't get keelhauled in
Villain always been, feel real genuine ballskin
Not queuing at the bar
Catch me at the table
Treacle walks past
Sweeter than maple
Piercing in her navel
Left school long time ago but got class, everything's tasteful

[Chorus: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Outro: 2D]
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Can't be bitter when I talk about him, Mike
I should have known better but I left without him and I
I used to dance for him, dance for him
I used to dance every Saturday night
I used to shake it for him, shake it for him
I want to stay but there's something ain't right

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write, I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one, I'm a wild one

It's the middle of winter but in my mind it's summer, Mike
Used to move for you, move for you

No man can handle me

Fifth string, Young Peggy Ringo (Go)
Slick with the ink, these melodies need Duolingo (Shit)
Same size as Dua Lipa, where the fuck my pen go?
Second fiddle to weirdos, you feel like Eddie Winslow
Street Fighter like Birdie, keep a stick like Rolеnto
Did you win if your purpose is just perfect potеntial?
Did you live up to it, is you just doin' the minimum?
Used to get fifty views, now they need Peggy's momentum (Yeah)
Let's check the addendum
Switch the code, I'm speakin' prophecies like That's So Raven
Bald-headed with lil' status, I feel like Maven
But I be dressed like Raven, up in the studio slavin'
Wonder how Peggy be— (Wait, wait)
Wonder how Peggy be cakin'? I be Easy Bakin'
My oven stay prepped and ready for the heat to take it
Niggas that took this road and failed ain't have proper placement
Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai
Who am I? Wake up every morning like it's do or die
No surprise, suits get jealous when you cut the ties
Livin' lie, Lance Armstrong at the finish line
Give it time, when we catch them cops on cam
I don't need six seconds, you remember Vine
It's nasty

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Hangin' from a chandelier in Babylon
We don't believe in white gods, they gettin' rattled on
Been in the belly of the kingdom, you can't tag along
Unless you got war on the mind, to get the shackles off
You can't ignore the karma when it's flames across your lawn
We checkin' corners, so make sure our lanes don't come across
See, word from Marvin, couldn't sue me from "What's Goin' On"
Movin' through the system, sprintin' through a marathon
We don't get second chance
And they don't need a reason now, so I don't let 'em plan
When I been fighting for the truth, I bring some extra hands
Cement inside my gloves to knock this shit into the fan
Put that on everything I love
It's been a minute, had to flip
It's in my blood to be a stack
Had to handle other business
Ain't no riddles, it's a fact
If you see me and my energy ain't really tryna chat
That's them generations chargin' the battery in my back
See, I'm fueled by the culture, driven by my ancestors
Body just a vessel, brain tapped into the answers
Tried to see me on the CCTV, couldn't scan 'em
Like the serial was scratched off on the barrel of the branding
I been ten toes down with the city on my shoulders
You got no idea how that weight could make you colder
Screamin', "Free my niggas," 'til they free it's never over
Spirit said, "It's time for me to really be a soldier now"

[Outro: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me (Uh)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all (Yeah), y'all (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You want me, I want you, baby

If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

Bro I’m rich, can you please come help dismantle me (Yeah)
Bitch I’m boujee come lick on my sack for me
Bro I’m good, you won’t get a sack from me
And I’m country, pronounce it like cat-e-gory, I mean cate-gory
I’m a carnivore, Cambodia
My newest bitch, like opioids
Give her Percocet and watch her open up (Go)
Dick deep, in a bitch throat, hoe she throw it up (Ew)
My dick, in her hand, like a paper cut (Slatt)
Isiaki on a nigga butt (Yeah)
Throwin’ cash in the strip club got em’ on the ground like an Easter hunt
Shawty geeked off a blunt of runts
Sixty grand for a nigga fronts
My niggas wear all red, like they work at Hunts
Hellcat do a lot of stunts
Been runnin’ routes for a couple months
Bro with more routes than the UPS
More scripts than the CVS
Shooter more clips than the TBS
He not fat at all, but think we the best
My brothers need it, I see it
If they catch the lick, then so be it
She come through drunk, the whole gang gon’ G it
He try us, know I DM, I mean it
For real, leave him anemic, in the cold
I don’t argue, I go for his hoe
Fuck her once, but she don’t let go
I got a bitch on her toes

[Outro]
Bitch, Plat

You're making promises to someone else's face
If those should break, call out my name
You're getting high off of some new life that you made
If that high fades, call out my name

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Tori Kelly]
I know you think about laying side by side

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When I look at you, yeah, I see forever
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I can see us vibin' for the rest of our days (Uh-huh)
Jumpin' over hurdles that try to get in our way (We do)
And they can say what they wanna say
Baby, we can go all the way
Just take my hand and follow me, yeah
I want you and only you, yes, I do
I wanna kick it like kung fu, wanna see what the drums do (Dun-dun-dun-dun, dun)
And you know I could tell no lies and that's on God
'Cause you're the one that I run to
Mic chеck, one-two, one-two
No one compеtes, you're all I need
Big flash, say, "Cheese"
Vacay in Paris
You're my baby boo like a ghost
When the tide rides, we gon' flow
Yeah, they try to stop us like no, like no, oh, no

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When I look at you, yeah, I see forever
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

[Interlude: DaBaby & Justin Bieber]
Right here, right here (Oh-oh-oh)
Right here, let's go

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
I want her right here in my arms
She really like me 'cause my charm
She like, "I didn't know you sing like that," I don't
I'm just givin' out flavor (Uh-huh), let's order a charter (Let's order a jet)
Won't go to the airport, let's fly to Jamaica (Like yoom)
I know that your friends wanna come with you, you can take 'em (Come on)
'Cause I'm not a bad sport (Let's go), you gon' need a passport
Me and you are a team
I'll be your bestie
Just promise you gon' love me and protect me
And I know you got everybody on your neck
And you curved 'em all to the left, everybody, except me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & DaBaby]
When I look at you, yeah, I see forever (Yeah, when I look at you)
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better (Know, oh-oh-oh-oh)
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

[Outro: DaBaby]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (Ha)

[Verse: Lana Del Rey & Chuck Grant]
Santa baby
Slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby
A fifty four convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa baby
And hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

[Verse 2]
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
With parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
No seams and no needle work
And then she'll be a true love of mine

[Verse 1]
You had plenty money in 1922
You let other women make a fool of you
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

[Verse 2]
If you had prepared twenty years ago
You wouldn’t be wanderin' now from door to door
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Why don’t you do right like some other men do?

[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

[Verse 2]
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut yourself on angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of Your Highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose, so I can climb right back

[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

[Intro]
Oooh, oh
Oooh, oh
Oooh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, keep your eyes on the road, keep your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
We're going to the Roadhouse
Gonna have a real
Real good time

[Verse 2]
The back of the Roadhouse they got some bungalows
The back of the Roadhouse got some bungalows
And that's for the people who like to get down slow

[Chorus]
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll
All night long

[Post-Chorus]
Do it, Robby, do it!

[Bridge 1]
You got to roll, roll, roll
Gotta thrill my soul, all right
Gotta roll, roll, roll, roll
Thrill my soul, all right
Oooh, ooh
Oooh, ooh

[Bridge 2]
Ashen lady
Ashen lady
Give up your vows
Give up your vows
Save our city
Save our city
Save our city
Right now

[Verse 3]
Well, I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer
Well, I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer
Because the future's uncertain and the end is always near

[Chorus]
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll
All night long

[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Since after all
You're my wonderwall

[Verse 3]
Today is gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Since after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Since after all
You're my wonderwall

Mhm, mhm

[Verse 1]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I grow lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

[Verse 2]
I miss your kiss and then I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet then send it to me

[Verse 3]
I miss your soup and I miss your brеad
And a letter in your writing doesn't mеan you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine

[Interlude]
P-I-X-I-E-S

[Verse 4]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me

[Verse 5]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 2]
Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh, dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 3]
Dance me to the wedding now, oh, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 4]
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 5]
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Outro]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 1]
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 2]
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 3]
Now the bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 4]
Well now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

[Verse 2]
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-onе

[Verse 3]
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good yеar
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

[Verse 4]
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
I can't hide the hole inside
Promised me that you would always be
Pierced my heart with cupids dart
The pressure builds and I can't sit still
Your mama doesn't wanna let you go
For a drive in my sky blue eldorado

[Chorus]
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
Thеre's love in the back of his nеw cadillac

[Verse 2]
All night long we watch the windows fog
And I can see my destiny
The music flows from the am radio
I'm almost sure that I'm gonna score
Pull you close and ask you what's the wait
Lets seize the opportunity before it's too late

[Chorus]
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
Yes there's love and I should be thanking someone

[Bridge]
What are you waiting for?
There's no better time than right now
What are we waiting for?
No better time to explore

[Chorus]
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
Yes there's love and I should be thanking someone
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do

[Verse 2]
Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filling the world surrounding me

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

[Chorus]
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

[Verse 2]
I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

[Chorus]
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

[Chorus]
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

[Chorus]
Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me
A smiling face
A warm embrace
Two arms to hold me tenderly

[Verse 2]
Where the boys are
My true love will be
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's looking there for me

[Bridge]
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine
And thеn I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tеll the world he's mine

[Hook]
Till he holds me
I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me

[Hook]
Till he holds me
I'll wait impatiently
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Where the boys are
Someone waits for me

[Verse 1: Woodkid]
Deep in the ocean, dead and cast away
Where innocence is burned, in flames
A million miles from home, I'm walking ahead
I’m frozen to the bone, I am

A soldier on my own, I don't know the way
I'm riding up the heights, of shame
I’m waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight, and fate

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & Woodkid]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The sound of iron shots is stuck in my head
The thunder of the drums, dictates
The rhythm of the falls, the number of deaths
The rising of the horns, ahead

From the dawn of timе to the end of days
I will have to run, away
I want to feel thе pain and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips, again

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey & Woodkid]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This deadly burst of snow is burning my hands
I'm frozen to the bone, I am
A million miles from home, I'm walking away
I can't recall your eyes, your face

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Joan Baez]
Well I'll be damned
Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
But where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
(In the) fifty years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what memoriеs can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
Well you burst on the scеne
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

[Verse 4: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
Snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have... then and there

[Verse 5: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
I once loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

[Verse 1]
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you really don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Well, look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 2]
Ain't no use calling out my name, babe
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name
I can't hear you anymore
I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we nevеr did too much talking anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 3]
It ain't no use turnin' on your light, babe
Thе light I never knowed
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light
I'm on the dark side of the road
I'm thinkin' and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a boy, he's a child I'm told
And I give him my heart, but he wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 4]
I'm going down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
I say "Fare thee well"
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
Well, you could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Outro]
And don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 1: Bryan Dunn]
I came back to town for the wedding
The last of the Stephenson brides
The talking died down to a whisper when they let me inside
I saw you there at the table
You smiled and you waved your right hand
Then they called for a toast and they all raised their glasses again

[Chorus: Bryan Dunn]
And there's a ten dollar ring on your finger
There's a five dollar ring in my hand
There's a ten dollar ring on your finger
And that five dollar ring goes back in my pocket again

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
I almost laughed when I saw you
In that suit that you borrowed from John
The pants were too short and the sleeves were a little too long
I only smiled but I tell you
I really wanted to cry
Cause I'm here at this table with somebody else by my side

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
There's a ten dollar ring on my finger
Cause you, you didn't ask for my hand
There's a ten dollar ring on my finger, yeah
Cause I never thought that I'd ever see you again

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey & Bryan Dunn]
No need to impress
Just a second hand dress
And something that's borrowed and blue
It'd be...

[Verse 1]
You’re beautiful with golden hair and black eyes
But you’re alone, you’re in the cold
So you hide

[Chorus]
Young hearts, run free
Let our inhibitions be swinging through the vine trees
Young hearts, run free
You can drive me crazy, baby, baby

[Refrain]
I want to
You want to
I want to
You want to

[Verse 2]
You’re beautiful with golden hair
But you’re alone, you’re in the cold
Young hearts run free
Young hearts run free

[Refrain]
To the jungle
To the jungle

[Verse 3]
Oh, this could be our starting out, our wild lives
And as the wind blows through your hair, you’ll find
Young hearts run free
Young hearts run free

[Refrain]
To the jungle
To the jungle
To the jungle

[Bridge]
I want to
You want to
I want to
You want to

[Refrain]
Go to thе jungle
To the jungle

[Verse 1]
Every heart comes crashing down
Will eat the words you say
Even kings can't keep their crowns
When peasants storm the gates
I don't want to be so proud
Can't own two estates

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in the end it's all about
The love you give away
The love you give away

[Verse 2]
Every sailor has started
Almost to the ground
People turn in dust in seeing
Each other sees the sound (?)
I don't want to be so high
The only way is down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in the end it's all about
The love you give away
The love you give away

[Chorus]
Takin' more than my share
Sharin' less than I should
But you wonder that
'Cause there's my heart long overdue
If you have that
Then I'd give that all to you
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 3]
Every heart comes crashing down
Will eat the words you say
Even kings can't keep their crowns
When peasants storm the gates
I don't want to be so proud
Can't own two estates

[Ending]
'Cause in the end it's all about
In the end it's all about
The love you give away
The love you give away
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Long money, hopes and dreams
Always be around them niggas with paper but got your own money
It's your world, buy this drink for you, girl
You said tell the DJ play this song for me
Here's my number in case you ever need company
Better weed, tons of drink, love the way I dress, let her rub my ink
Hell yeah, I'm fly, that's why they all beneath me

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]

Foot on the gas when I see you yeah cause she ready to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look, look
Dickies shorts and Rolex watches
I'm smoking while she dancin' topless
I think lil' mama think she down
Tell me that she strips so she could pay her way through college
Bricks of money like I robbed a bank
At my table wrapped in plastic with a gang of drank
Fuck what you think
I’'m gon' throw this money cause that’s why we came

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
That money fall and she make dough
I'm giving her all she can take though
And you know we ball but this ain't no game, no
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for
Yeah, that's what we came for
Throwing my money when I see you every time she getting low, low, low, low, low, low, low, yeah

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]

Supply your own smoke, you like your own zip
No leasing yours, you like to own shit
So rich, the one them niggas hate, the bitches wanna go with (Go with)
I'm buyin O's like it's Wheel of Fortune
Feeling flawless, living lawless, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Throwing my money when I see you every time she getting low, low, low, low, low, low, low, yeah
Foot on the gas when I see you yeah cause she ready to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
And all them other hoes competing, they ain't even comin' close, close, close, close, close, close, close, yeah

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm throwing money up and watching her go round and round
Watching her go round and round
I'm throwing money up and watching it come down, come down
Watching it come down, come down
And we can go to my house or we can go to your crib
We can jump in your car, you can see how I live
But I'm still throwing money up
So much I'm losing count, can't count
So much I'm losing count, can't count
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout
If you were God
Tomorrow
Stand up
At the sunrise / All Night

Stand by / So close
Round and Round
Tomorrow lies
Come on, love

Do you know how it ends?
Do you know when to stop?
Come out, civilized
A view from the top

The world spinning 'round
That / The clouds can't allow
Come out, see the end
And a view from the top

So close / Stand by
Tomorrow's now
Oh, here I am
Oh, here I am!
Do you know where it ends?
Or know when it stops?
The world celebrates / Then you celebrate
A view from the top

Then you celеbrate
Oh love, sing it loud
Oh, la-la-la-la
A view from thе top

From the top
A view from the top
A view from the top

So, love
Tomorrow
Answer
Now

[Verse 1]
He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see trying hard
To recreate what had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say, hey, only to realize
It never really was

[Chorus]
He had a place in her life
She never made him think twicе
As he rises to her apology
Anybody еlse would surely know
He's watching her go
And what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power, oh yeah, to reason away now
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing, oh yeah
Nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago (Ah)
He can still believe there's a place in her life
Hey, someday, some way, she will return

[Chorus]
He had a place in her life, oh
She never made him think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go, oh yeah
What a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power, oh yeah, to reason away, yeah
And what seems to be
Is always better than nothing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Nothing at all, nothing at all

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Get the funk, get it now (Whoop)
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now, oh

[Outro]
What a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power (No wise man has the power)
To reason away (Oh, to reason away, yeah)
What a fool believes, he sees (What a fool believes, oh, he sees)
No wise man has the power
To reason away, yeah, yeah (What a fool believes, he sees)

[Verse 1: SZA]
I think I'm bad as hell
I got issues, out of line
Sayin' tomorrow I'll get the dishes
Never come
Easy bake, easy wake, oven
Just give as much as you take
Forgive as much as you hate
Or get the fuck out

[Pre-Chorus 1: SZA]
I've been in the dugout
Lookin' for a way out
You know just takin' it slow
Now I'm feeling worn out
Lookin' for a way out
Somebody show me the door

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I was wavy
And I was drownin'
I went crazy
And I found out, this the way out
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy

[Verse 2: SZA]
I need, I need, I need another re-up
I need, I need, I need another peace of mind
Need more than California
Couple of waves, think I need the whole sea
Couple of days, think I need the whole week
Nigga, I can just beat the univеrse
'Cause I, I, I, I, I, I provide for mysеlf
Ride for myself, die for day ones
Get down 'cause they got guns
And no one around to save you, come correct
It's gory
Good morning New Jersey

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the door babe
You know just takin' it slow babe
Somebody show me the ropes, babe

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
I was wavy
And I was drownin'
I went crazy
And I found out, this the way out
Now I'm wavy
Now I'm wavy
How many ways can you break my heart
And leave me here torn all apart and almost gone?
How many ways can you do me wrong
And how many times can I write the same song
Of love alone?

How many times will the world run dry?
And how many ways can you tell the same lie?
I'm almost gone

Again and again and around and round
You get me so high and watch my life come tumbling down
Time after time it's the same old thing
You leave alone in this wretched kingdom
I'm almost gone

I swear... next time...
I'm almost gone...

How many ways can you break my hеart
And leave me hеre torn all apart and almost gone?
How many ways can you do me wrong
And how many times can I write the same old song
Of love alone?
Again and again and around and round
You get me so high and watch
While I come tumbling down
Time after time it's the same old thing
You leave alone in this wretched kingdom
I'm almost gone

I'm swear...

I'm almost gone

[Verse 1]
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, thе kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, thе kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Verse 2]
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Bridge]
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
(Boys will be boys)
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
(Boys will be boys)
But girls will be women

[Outro]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women (Women)

[Intro]
We doin' good
We doin' good
That's your problem

[Verse 1]
Pulling me down like an anchor
Sayin' it's my fault, you're angered
Telling me no one will love me (Watch your mouth)
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)
You and me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that (What the fuck?)
Now it's my turn to bite back (I've had enough)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, did it to yourself (Yourself)
Playing with my mind (My mind)
Putting me through hell (Hell)
Ooh, I'd be broken too (Too)
If you left me like (Me like) like I left you
That's your problem

[Chorus]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

[Sample Interlude]
I mean you act like I did it for that long
I couldn't even do it that long
That's your problem

[Verse 2]
Doin' it all for reaction
Doing the most in your caption
Making me seem like the bad guy (Watch your mouth)
Try to bring me down, but nice try
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to like you
How did I like you? (What the fuck?)
I used to like you
And now I don't (We doin' good)
Ooh, I'd be broken too (Too)
If you left me like (Me like) like I left you
That's your problem

[Chorus]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

[Bridge]
And my daddy said you're good for nothing (Yeah, yeah)
Cause he know you're always up to something (Yeah, yeah)
And my friends, they don't wanna hear about it anymore, anymore
I'm just happy that you're not my problem (Yeah, yeah)

[Sample Interlude]
All you wanna talk about girls, hoes, chicks, this and that
Wanna be Mr. Instagram famous, comment, DMing
That's your problem

[Chorus]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Lyrics from Snippet

We had a kind of love, I thought that it would never end
Oh my lover, oh my other, oh my friend
We talked around in circles and we talked around again
I loved you to the moon and back again
We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end

Oh my lover
Oh my other
Oh my friend

We talked around in circles
We talked around again

I love you to the moon and back again

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beating loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, take me to heaven, won't you?
Show me, you're looking so good on me
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me, take me to heaven, won't you?
Show me, you're looking so good on me
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found the one
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
That you're the human I want
I can't believe there's something left
Inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beating loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la (Oh)

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found the one
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
That you're the human I want
I can't believe there's something left
Inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again (Touch me, take me)
You got me in love again (Show me the way)
You got me in love again (Touch me, take me)
Again (Show me the way)

[Verse 1]

Hit you harder than you ever expected (Ooh)
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night (Ah-ha)
Keep it going till we see the sunlight

You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could show you all the higher life
You know, you know I got

[Chorus]
Got you losin' all your cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And you love the way I move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
I got ya, I got ya losin' all your cool
I guess we're ready for the summеr (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I like us better whеn we're intertwined (Ah-ha)
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Hey)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine (Ah-ha)
You got me working up an appetite-tite

[Pre-Chorus]
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could show you all the higher life
You know, you know I got

[Chorus]
Got you losin' all your cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do

Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you

I guess we're ready for the summer (Ooh)

Skintight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got you losin' all your cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

[Chorus]
Got you losin' all your cool (Woo)
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you (Hey)
In control of what I do
And you love the way I move (Hey, go)
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice (Woo)
When it's only me and you
I got ya, I got ya losin' all your cool (Cool, cool, cool)

Trash man, trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man

[Verse 1]
Trash man, trash man
He is the trash man, he fills up the trash can
He picks up the waste, he's got really good taste
He is the trash man, he do what he can
Can't do what he can't, but he's the trash man

[Chorus]
Trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride, hey
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride

The banker is thе cash man
The photographer's the flash man
Thе barber is the 'stache man
And the driver is the crash man (Crash man)
The runner is the dash man
And the teacher is the class man
The swimmer is the splash man
But the trash man is the trash man (Haha)
Trash man, trash man, trash man, trash man (Take out the trash)

Trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride, hey

I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride

[Verse 1]
-home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she don't want to drink 'cause she know I might like it
And she gon' roll it up 'cause she know I might like it

[Verse 1]
Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
Now it's all I catch
But today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishing hole today
She'd be packing all her things
And she'd be gone by noon

[Chorus]
Well, I'm gonna miss her (Come on)
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm going miss her
Oh, lookey there, I've got a bite!

[Verse 2]
Well there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
That water's right
And the weather's perfect
No telling what I might catch today

[Chorus]
So, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookey there, I've got a bite
Alright
Hey, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, lookey there, I've got a bite!

[Verse 1]
Shorty, I've been tryna feel you out
Let me know what's goin' on
Seems to me that you ain't got no man
'Cause the love is always gone
But you keep on tryin' to brush me off
And then you find yourself callin' me
But you don't wanna jeopardize what you got
Even though you'd rather be with me

[Chorus]
You got a man, he never home
Pretty little thing cryin' on the phone
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone
You got a man, he never home
Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone

[Verse 2]
Day by day keep on passin' you by
Got you feelin' like you're sittin' on a passenger side
At the booty club getting drunk and high
While you're home all alone, cryin', wonderin' why
Oh no, girl, I can't have that
Too cute to be havin' an attitude and all that
When you're fallin' down, I be the one to grab at
And when you're on your feet, you go right back, yeah

[Chorus]
You got a man, he never home
Pretty little thing cryin' on the phone
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone
You got a man, he never home
Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone

[Bridge]
'Cause I got nothing to lose and nothing to gain
Gotta make up your mind if you want me on your team
You don't want me to stay, you don't want me to leave
But you wanna hug me up until a brother can't breathe
Like, what do you want from me?
You say you wanna love me, but your man's in the way
Still, what do you want from me?
I guess I cut it up again and call it a day 'cause

[Chorus]
You got a man, he never home
Pretty little thing cryin' on the phone
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone
You got a man, he never home
Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone

[Chorus]
You got a man, he never home
Pretty little thing cryin' on the phone
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone
You got a man, he never home
Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong
City lights came on and then went off again
And you're still alone

Konvict, Music, and you know we Upfront

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say, "I don't talk Dogg, then she told on me", oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby stick to me, and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you
D-O double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot 'fo the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby, your pussy for life

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

[Verse 2: Akon]
Shorty I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me, now what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Akon]
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (Just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby I see you)
Hmm, it's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet, you're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

[Verse 4: Akon]
Girl and while you're lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know, girl, girl

[Verse 1]
Well, I been spending all my money on weed n' pills
Trynao write a song that'll pay the bills
But it ain't came yet so guess I'll have to rob a bank
I guess it could be worse, it ain't that bad
At least I ain't sitting in ol' Baghdad
In the middle of a hot damn desert sitting in a tank
Well every time the wife talks a baby gets mentioned
I'm so broke I can't pay attention
Lord how it tears me up to see her cry
Well I've been spendin' all my nights on the internet
Lookin' for a clue but ain't found one yet
Just a bunch of Mopars, guitars, and other shit I can't buy

[Chorus]
Well now Lord if you can hеar me
Won't you throw a damn dog a bone
'Cause if thе Devil shows up with a better deal
This old soul's a-going down
Oh, I sing 'em real pretty, sing 'em real sad
And all the people in the crowd say, "He ain't half bad"
Well they call me King Turd up here on Shit Mountain
If you want it you can have the crown

[Verse 2]
Well I been sitting on my ass like a bump on a log
Watching Andy and ol' Boss Hog
I guess I ought to get up and go out and find a job
Instead of sittin' on the couch trying to find the next line
I'm sure there's gotta be a better use of my time
Like figurin' out which one of these banks I'm a-gonna go rob
Well the name of the game is hurry up and wait
But that ain't puttin' no food on my plate
Or gas in my car, and I drive a Bronco
So Lord if I could just get me a record deal
I might not have to worry about my next meal
But I'll still be tryna figure out what the fuck rhymes with Bronco

[Chorus]
Well now Lord if you can hear me
Won't you throw a damn dog a bone
'Cause if the Devil shows up with a better deal
This old soul's a-going down
Well I sing 'em real pretty, sing 'em real sad
And all the people in the crowd say, "He ain't half bad"
Well they call me King Turd up here on Shit Mountain
If you want it you can have the crown
Well they call me King Turd up here on Shit Mountain
If you want it you can have the crown

[Verse 1]
I can fake it and pretend
I don’t wanna see your face again
And I can find me someone new
But all I want is to be with you

[Verse 2]
I can learn how to let you go
And carry on with the one man show
I’ll fade away into the blue
But all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you

[Verse 3]
I’ll get dressed and hit the town tonight
Meet some faces under neon lights
I dance alone with deja-vu
But all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you

[Verse 4]
They said I’d hurt you, said I’d run
Just like I always do with everyone
But you were different I was true
And all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you

[Outro]
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you’re feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you’re my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm lеvitating (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
I believe that you'rе for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far (ever too far)
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are (shining, shining, shining baby)
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we’re renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you’re my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you’re my starlight
I need you all night (All night), come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

[Bridge]
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can’t stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Take you for a ride)
I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let me take you for a ride)

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Outro]
Ain't no gravitation, supernatural elation, outer space, space station
That's our dance vibration (Wow)
Ain't no gravitation, supernatural elation, outer space, space station
That's our dance vibration

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)

[Bridge]
(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Mmm)
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the
