 ocean floor
Everything reacting in common sense
When placed beneath the awe your omnipotence
Please won't you show me how I should live
So glory I can give

[Pre-Chorus:]
'Cause I depend on you no matter what I do
I know that you'll always come though
You never change the rules
I can depend on the always-ness of you

[Chorus:]
Never change you'll remain
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly
That's the always-ness

[Chorus:]
Never change you'll remain
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly
That's the always-ness

[Bridge:]
It's so simple when I do things your way
So I try everyday, but sometimes my path can get hard
Even when I start off with the best of intentions
I get weak and fall short
And I know when I'm down you'll be there to lift me up
You love will never waver

[Chorus:]
Never change you'll remain
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly
That's the always-ness

[Chorus:]
Never change you'll remain
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly
That's the always-ness

[Ad-Libs:]
Faithful through life's ups and downs
So, heavenly your love for me
Never; never, never change
You'll remain; you'll remain
Faithful so faithful
Everlasting love for me
The always-ness of... God
...of God
Well never know
What lies ahead tomorrow
But you're not alone
Where ever you go
I follow

Well never know
What lies ahead tomorrow
But you're not alone
Where ever you go
I follow

You're not alone
You're not alone
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

They think I'm bad and I treat her so mean
But all they know is from what they've seen
And when I get her alone now
You know we're happy as a couple could be
And when I give her my love it's between her and me

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

Some guys may think they'd be better for her
But she knows just what she wants for sure
And when we're out with our friends now
You know that we never have to put on a show
And we stay together while other couples come and go
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
Well, baby, baby, baby look at you
Yes, I said baby, baby, baby, baby look at you
Well, you want to jump on me and hurt me
'Cos I won't let you tell me what to do

Well, when I first met you baby
You didn't know what love is about
You were standin' on the streets beggin'
And ragged as a barrel of sauerkraut

Baby, baby, baby look at you
Well now, you want to jump on me and hurt me
'Cos I won't let you tell me what to do

Well, you said once that you loved me
I would always be your own
And now you got your hands on some money, baby
And you're drivin' B.B. away from home

Well, you said that you loved me
I always would be your man
Now you thrown me outdoors
And said "Go and do the best you can"
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Thank you
When a girl reach the age of eighteen
She begin to think she's grown
And that's the kind of girl
You can't never find at home
Come see me early in the morning
Baby 'bout the break of day
You oughta saw me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay

One drink of wine two drinks of gin
Pretty young girl got me in the state I'm in
Come see me early in the morning
Baby 'bout the break of day
Lord you oughta saw me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay

Passed by the juke joint
Peeked through the door
She was doing the boogie woogie
In the middle of the floor
Come see me early in the morning
Baby 'bout the break of day
Lord you oughta saw me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay
Where my baby used to lay
Whatever i'm doing here it's not fair
Wasting water and wasting air
Stay in bed and start a sound
Keep your head cool underground
All aflame and all aflower
All alone in wigan tower
Oh lord, what a paradise to be
All alone for just an hour
Father, lover, supervisor
Bleeding hearts for the bleeding heart
My lean baby, tall and thin
Five feet seven of bones and skin
But when she tells me maybe she loves me
I feel as mellow as a fellow can be

She's so skinny, she's so drawn
When she stands sideways, you'd think she's gone
But when she calls me baby, I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine

She's slender, but she's tender
She makes my heart surrender
And every night, when I hold her tight
The feeling is nice, my arms can go around twice

My lean baby, she's so slim
A broomstick's wider, but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me, then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go

My lean baby, strange to see
And all that nothing, it belongs to me
And though she may be scrawny, she's okay
Because I wouldn't want her any other way
Man, she's so skinny, she's so drawn
When she stands sideways, you would think that she's gone
But when she calls me baby, I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine

I chased her - and I caught her
Then a diamond ring, I bought her
Hey, the diamonds shine, the ring is so fine
But here is the twist, she wears it right on her wrist

My lean baby, she's so slim
A broomstick's wider, but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me, then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go

My lean baby, tall and thin
(do-do-do-do-do,...)

Keep me from rocking the white gold
Bitches hail

When we do shows we sell out super domes
While you at home burning the hot coal
Honey left you coming home to me like it's a curfew
One nice day and now she calling me boo
And she calling you through
And you calling me singing the sad tune
I wish Kelly would pick up the celly
Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her belly

Been thinking 'bout you all night
Guess you got me in your spell
But I think that I'll be allright
Even if I don't get well....

Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....

I can still remember
What you told me with your eyes
One kiss
Now it's down to this
Guess it's time you realize

Hey, Miss Sun, what could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon
Got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms
Has you back in my arms.....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning
Has you back in my arms
In my arms..... ooh.... ooh.... ah.... ah....ahh
Yeah..... yeah, yeah ,yeah

Hey , Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in my way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....

One kiss is what I need.....
One kiss.... give it to me......
It won't be long until the morning has you......
Won't be long until the morning has you back in my arms......

One kiss....I realize
One kiss....I can see it in your eyes

Oh, it won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms.....
The statue in the harbor is a lovely sight
The Rockettes in precision are a sheer delight
But I for one would rather visit John McKnight
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet me at the Copa tonight

There are those who just adore the art museum
And out in Brooklyn, there's a ballpark and it seems
But I don't care a whole lot if I never see 'em
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight

The show goes on and on and on
Do you hear the applause and the cheering?
Even if you're wooing, drop what you're doing
Hurry down, see what you're hearing

On 52nd street, they now have burleque
And you count the effervescence and see the view
But all that stuff that squares is my advice to you
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight
Now some of you may like to go to movie shows
Or walk along Fifth Avenue to view the clothes
But here's the place that's famous for Durante's nose
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight

You'll see the nicest people in the nicest cars
They come to see the lounge across the lovely bars
And it's the spot where stars come just to see the stars
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight

The show goes on and on and on
Do you hear the applause and the cheering?
Even if you're wooing, drop what you're doing
Hurry down, see what you're hearing

The most amazing club in town you will admit
It's imitated quite a lot but this is it
And if you want to see where all the new acts hit
Meet me at the Copa, meet me at the Copa
Meet at the Copa tonight

[Skit: Suzanne Lemignot & R. Kelly]
Hi, this is Irene Vegas for Facts On Fame and we're here at R. Kelly's packed out Rockland Cafe's grand opening and what an event this is
Let me tell you, there are celebrities here from all over the globe
The players, the top ballers are here
The finest cars, from Bentleys ajours to V12's just rolling in
Oh, speaking of top ballers, here's R. Kelly right now
Let's see if we can get the facts
R. Kelly, hi, Irene Vegas with Facts On Fame, I want to ask you some questions
Go right ahead
Well, first of all, I've got to say, this grand opening is the bomb. How do you feel?
Doggish
Well, aren't we being honest?
You want the facts though
Well, since you put it like that, let me ask you some other questions. What turns R. Kelly on?
What turns me on? You and all these lovely honies here tonight
Oh, is that right?
Yeah
Well, do they make you happy?
Make me happy? Uh-huh
Would you say they turn you on?
I'd say they turn me on but I ain't say they made me happy
Well, how do you feel about award shows? Do those things make you happy?
What you mean?
Well you know, award shows like, win an award. How do you feel about that?
Man, it feels good. It feels good to win anything though
But does it make you happy?
Put it like this, hold on, man! Hold up, I'm coming. It's the, ayy, man, save me one of those Cubans. Yeah, it feels good though
Well, let me just put it like this, what makes R. Kelly happy?
And that's the question of the night, the loot
My name is Donald White, you see
I stand before you all
I was judged by you a murderer
And the hangman's knot must fall
I will die upon the gallows pole
When the moon is shining clear
And these are my final words
That you will ever hear

I left my home in Kansas
When I was very young
I landed in the old Northwest
Seattle, Washington
Although I'd a-traveled many miles
I never made a friend
For I could never get along in life
With people that I met

If I had some education
To give me a decent start
I might have been a doctor or
A master in the arts
But I used my hands for stealing
When I was very young
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells
That's how my life begun
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners
I found they were my kind
And it was there inside the bars
I found my peace of mind
But the jails they were too crowded
Institutions overflowed
So they turned me loose to walk upon
Life's hurried tangled road

And there's danger on the ocean
Where the salt sea waves split high
And there's danger on the battlefield
Where the shells of bullets fly
And there's danger in this open world
Where men strive to be free
And for me the greatest danger
Was in society

So I asked them to send me back
To the institution home
But they said they were too crowded
For me they had no room
I got down on my knees and begged
"Oh, please put me away,"
But they would not listen to my plea
Or nothing I would say
And so it was on Christmas eve
In the year of '59
It was on that night I killed a man
I did not try to hide
The jury found me guilty
And I won't disagree
For I knew that it would happen
If I wasn't put away

And I'm glad I've had no parents
To care for me or cry
For now they will never know
The horrible death I die
And I'm also glad I've had no friends
To see me in disgrace
For they'll never see that hangman's hood
Wrap around my face

Farewell unto the old north woods
Of which I used to roam
Farewell unto the crowded bars
Of which've been my home
Farewell to all you people
Who think the worst of me
I guess you'll feel much better when
I'm on that hanging tree
But there's just one question
Before they kill me dead
I'm wondering just how much
To you I really said
Concerning all the boys that come
Down a road like me
Are they enemies or victims
Of your society?
Paul Robeson, he’s the man
That faced the Ku Klux Klan
On hollow grove’s golfing ground
His words come sounding

And all around him there
To jump and clap and cheer
I sent the best I had, the best I had
My thirty thousand

The Klansman leader said
That Paul would lose his head
When thirty five thousand vets
Broke up that concert

But less than four thousand came
To side with the Klan
But around Paul’s lonesome oak
My thirty thousand

A beersoaked brassy band
Did snortle round the grounds
Four hundred noblest souls
Westchester’s manhood
And they looked exactly like
The fleas on a tiger’s back
Lost fish in the waters of
My thirty thousand

When Paul had sung and gone
And the kids and babies home
Cops came with guns and clubs
And they clubbed and beat 'em

Well, I’d hate to be a cop
Caught with a bloody stick
'Cause you can’t bash the brains
Out of thirty thousand

Each eye you tried to gouge
Each skull you tried to crack
Has a thousand, thousand friends
Around this green grass

If you furnish the skull someday
I'll pass out the clubs and guns
To the billion hands that love
My thirty thousand

Each wrinkle on your face
I know it at a glance
You cannot run and hide
Nor duck nor dodge them
And your carcass and your deeds
Will fertilize the seeds
Of the men that stood to guard
My thirty thousand
Of the men that stood to guard
My thirty thousand
Train of love's a comin', big black wheels are hummin'
People waitin' at the station, happy hearts are drummin'
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Now stop your whistle blowin' 'cause I've got ways of knowin'
You're bringin' other people's lovers but my own keeps goin'
Train of love deceivin', when she's not gone she's leavin'

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Train of love now hasten, sweethearts stand and waitin'
Here and there and everywhere there'll gonna be embracin'
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Train of love's a leavin', leavin' my heart grievin'
But early or late I sit and wait because I'm still believin'
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
You'll shout when it hits you - yes indeed!
Yes you'll shout when it hits you - yes indeed!
When the spirit moves you, you'll shout: "hallelujah!"
When it hits you, (you'll) holler (shout) - yes indeed!
Inside every teenage girl there's a fountain
Inside every young pair of pants there's a mountain
Inside every mother's eyes is Tommy Tinkrem's bed
Inside every candidate waits a grateful dead

I make it a thing, when I'm on my own to relieve myself
I make it a thing, when I gazelle on stage to believe in myself
I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself
Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home

I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room
Took me a fag, and a kick in the moon
Well, I ain't gonna suck no radar wing
Because inside this tin is tin
Would you like to techno-plate 'cause I'm your candidate, oh yeah

It's a matter of life
And the way you walk, you've got a BrylCream queen
It's a matter of tact
In the things you talk, that keeps his passport clean
A matter of fact
That a cock ain't a cock on a twelve inch screen
So I'll pretend I'm walking home
You don't have to scream a lot to keep an age in tune
You don't have to scream a lot to predict monsoons
You don't have to paint my contact black
Now I've hustled a pair of jeans
Do I have to give your money back when I'm the Fuhrerling?

I'll make you a deal
I'll say I came from Earth and my tongue is taped
I'll make you a deal
You can get your kicks on the candidate
I'll make you a deal
For your future's sake, I'm the candidate
Lets pretend we're walking home

Uh-huh, uhhh
I'm the candidate
Make way for the candidate
Vote now for the candidate

[Intro]
Oh, oh I
(Hear me now, hear me now, hear me now)
Oh, oh I
Oh, oh I

Anything you need (I can do it better)
You know I got it (I can do it better)
Some of us
We're hardly ever here
The rest of us were born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from going under?

Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're trying to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
Wheels up
I've got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

[Chorus]
Get crazy, get wild
Let's party, get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something
If you wanna have fun and do something
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something
If you wanna have fun and do something

[Verse 1]
Walk in the club with no ID
Girls on my jock cause I'm VIP
Your man can't do what I can do
What's your name - I'm SkyBlu
Well I'm RedFoo with the big ass fro
Never wear lenses in my glasses yo
My first keyboard was a Casio
Oooh look at that girl on the dancin floor
Was she lookin at us like she wanna do
Somethin freaky in the back with a camera crew
I guess I got time for a fan or two
I roll with 3 hoes like Santa do
Ho Ho Ho and a bottle of goose
Mix it with the bull if you wanna get loose
It's that time to lose control
If you're feelin real good then let it show

[Chorus]
Get crazy, get wild
Let's party, get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy like flash yo titties
Get crazy, get wild
Let's party, get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy like flash yo titties

[Verse 2]
When I was a baby, I was suckin' on titties
Now that I'm older, still suckin on titties
Different titties - but titties nonetheless
The first thing I do when a girl undress
Crazy girl spark my interest
If titties were a stock, I'd invest in breast
Love the way you move, I'm impressed
Lotta girls love us we the best I guess hey

[Bridge]
I got the goose, alright, ok
I'm feelin' loose, alright ok
She love the beats, alright, ok
We love them D's, alright, ok

She love the beat, alright, ok
We love them D's

[Chorus]
Get crazy, get wild
Let's party, get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy like flash yo titties
Get crazy, get wild
Let's party, get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy like flash yo titties

[Bridge 2]
If you in the car, flash yo titties
If you at the bar, flash yo titties
If you at the beach, flash yo titties
If you on the street, flash yo titties
I said if you in the car, flash yo titties
I said if you at the bar, flash yo titties
If you at work, flash yo titties
Even if you at church, flash yo titties

[Bridge 3]
In Europe they show t-titties all the time
But here in LA every titty a prize
So girl let me see what you tryin to hide
Has either of your titties ever touched the sky
Now if your shy (if your shy)
Just close your eyes (just close your eyes)
And pull your titties out like you part of tha African tribe

[Break]

[Outro]

Every kiss, every hug
Seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me

Let me stay in your arms
I'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be a habit with me

I used to think your love was something I could take or leave alone
But now I couldn't do without my supply
I need you for my own

Oh, I can't break away
I must have you everyday
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches and I can't break free
You're getting to be a habit with me

[Skit: Mia Pitts, Keith B-Real & Will Smith]
Good evening, ladies and gentleman, I'm Mia Pitts, and I'm standing in front of the historic Mann's Chinese Theatre where thousands, literally thousands of fans, journalists, and well-wishers have gathered merely to catch a glimpse of the artist formerly known as Fresh Prince

Yes, you know she's mean, and she's always doing me wrong
I believe to my soul, I've got leave my home

She is a mean woman, oh, she never treats me right
Oh, mean and evil woman, and she never treats me right
Only go around every day, and don't come home 'til midnight

Lord, if only, only she would treat me fair
Oh, if I could get my baby, if could only get her to treat me fair
Oh, she would own me, yes, she would own me anywhere

[Verse 1]
No one can blame you
For walking away
But too much rejection
No love injection
Life can't be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell

[Post-Verse]
But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene, a crystal moon, ah-ha

[Pre-Chorus]
It's only forever
Not long at all
The lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground

[Chorus]
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here

[Intro]
What do I do?
Stop? Go?
Fail? Succeed?
Live or die?
I just gotta believe

[Verse 1]
Believe, it's worth saving
And to get lost, lost in a daydream
So why hesitate? Take me to another place
So far, far away, so I can get out of the dark
High speed, like I'm racing
Just like lighting, the sky is blazing
But you've lost your way, you've been lead astray
Are there better days for my fallen dreamer?

[Chorus]
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
You don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more
Dream no more, you don't even dream no more
Dreamer, dreamer
Why don't you just dream again?

[Verse 2]
Believe in you
You've got something to prove
You're a star, watch you shine bright
On your way to the limelight, finish line
The sweat and tears
You can channel all of your fears
Open your eyes, your eyes
And it will be alright

[Chorus]
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
You don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more
Dream no more, you don't even dream no more
Dreamer, dreamer
Why don't you just dream again?

[Bridge]
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer (You dream)

[Chorus]
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer (Hey)
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
Calling a dreamer, a dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
A dreamer, a-a-a-a dreamer
You don't sleep no more, you don't even sleep no more
Dream no more, you don't even dream no more
Dreamer, dreamer
Why don't you just dream again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy

Ice cream, couldn't taste any better
Your bad reputation
A mission that you keep to the letter
A state of love, can drive us all insane
Why a man can stand for so much pain
But I stand
You know the time is right
I feel my knees start shaking
And I can't stop running

You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I breakdown to the ground, and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy when you touch me, and I'm over the top
Don't wanna fight it and I'm giving up
Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor
Nobody can save me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy
I know, I know
I know, oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't sleep, can't sleep
I turn the television on
It's your face that I see on the screen
Replacing all the other ones
I'm so blind, that every girl I see
Reminds me that I need to be
In your arms
The place is here and now
The brain is past controlling and
The soul is crying

You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I breakdown to the ground, and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy for your fingers up and down my spine
Come a little closer baby, you will find
Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor when I'm almost dying
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy

Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor, when I'm almost dying
Gotta keep trying
You don't know but you're number 1
I go crazy for your love
You give me feelings that I
Couldn't get from anyone
I go crazy for your love...
I... keep... alive
And he's still... forty five years old and cold
And all my wounds are...
When the... floats and flies
Steadily before your eyes
It's best to discuss
You feel...
Hey the sun and sea and you
And... OK at what you do
And what you do is beautiful
I can bear to trip today
Throw away my head
I might just...
Hey the sun and sea and you
And I don't care what you do
What you do is beautiful
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...
When I was a lad of three-foot-three
Certain questions occurred to me
So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee
He stammered and he stuttered pathetically
And this is what he said to me

He said, "The woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I went and ask a good friend of mine
Known to the world as Albert Einstein
He said "Son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and a minus ten means a routine only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove
That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I grabbed a boat and went abroad
In Baden Baden asked Sigmund Freud
He said "Son, from your sad face remove the grouch
Put the body down up on the couch
I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation
Hey love and hate is psychosomatic
Your Rorsach shows that you're a peri pathetic
It all started with a broken sibling
In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

Well I traveled far and I traveled wide
And I don't even have me self a bride
All the great men upon this earth
Have confused me since my birth
I've been over land and been over sea
Trying to find answer 'bout the bird and bee
But now that I am ninety three
I don't give a darn you see
If the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

[Verse 1]
The minus is loveless, he talks to the land
And the leaves fall and the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, plus she don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up too easy

[Verse 2]
The masking tape tangles, it's sticky and black
And the copper proud-headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges that don't get charged back
Well, the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy

[Chorus 1]
And she holds out her flashlight and she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her what the trouble might be
Well I'm learning it's peaceful with a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown of this century
They're not going to fix it up too easy

[Verse 3]
We once loved-together and we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded and the sparks started flying
And the loose wires were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up too easy

[Chorus 2]
But she holds out her candle and she shines it in
And she begs him to show her how to fix it again
While the song that he sang her to soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up too easy

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah-eah
Ooh-ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I always loved you
Even though you did me wrong
I always stayed by your side
I guess I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one above you
I swear
Cheated on me, now she's there
She won't answer your calls
Don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standin' with open arms
Sucker for love, your kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

[Chorus]
I'll settle for you (baby)
Yes, I will be the one who will (baby)
Settle for you
Yes, I will be the one you run to
You come running to
Yes I will be the one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you

[Verse 2]
I can never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again
I'll still be right here waitin'
Nothing has changed
It remains the same
I can't explain
Sucker for love, your kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you

[Chorus]
I'll settle for you (you, baby)
Yes, I will be the one who will (hee)
Settle for you (hee-hee)
Yes, I will be the one you run to (I'll settle for you, baby-yeah)
You come running to (come running to, oh)
Yes, I will be the one who will
Settle for you (settle for you)
Settle for you (settle for you)

[Bridge]
Even when the chips are down
I'll still settle for you (oh-oh)
You'll prob'ly hurt me again
I'll still settle for you (oh-whoa)
I know I must be
The world's greatest fool (oh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (oh-whoa)
Even when the chips are down
I'll still settle for you (oh-oh)
You'll prob'ly hurt me again
I'll still settle for you (oh)
I know I must be
The world's greatest fool (oh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll still settle for you (ooh)

[Chorus]
I'll settle for you (whoo)
Yes, I will be the one who will (whoo)
Settle for you (ooh-whoa, settle for you, baby)
Yes, I will be the one you run to (hey, I will always love you no matter how hard I try)
You come running to (prob'ly do it again, I'll still be here waitin')
Yes, I will be the one who will (stuck wit' you, in love wit' you, here for you, lovin' you)
Settle for you (settlin' for you, baby)
Settle for you (yeah)

[vocalizing]
You came to me from out of nowhere, you took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Make every hour as sweet as a flower to me
If you should go back to your nowhere. leaving me with just a memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you bring your love to me
One, two, three

Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabama once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor, boo boo boo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama

Ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
(Yes, they do!)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how about you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama, oh, sweet home baby
Where the skies are so blue and the governor's true
Sweet home Alabama, Lordy
Lord, I'm coming home to you, yeah yeah
Montgomery's got the answer

[Intro]
So cold, so cold, so cold...

[Verse 1]
Cold December nights like this make me really scared
You're not really there
And my tree is really bare
Another lonely night
No gifts, no toys underneath my tree
Can this really be
I'm singing Christmas Carols
And there's no Christmas for me

[Chorus]
Why aren't you next to me
Celebrating Christmas
Why can't you see what hurts so bad
How can you go without paying mind to my sorrow
You can't imagine
How I feel on this cold December night

[Verse 2]
The stars shine bright as the night air
And the thought of you not being here
Makes me shed a tear
And yet matters remain unclear
About why you're gone
Or if you'll ever return to this broken heart
Life is so torn apart
And God knows, Lord knows where I need to start re-building

[Chorus]
Why aren't you next to me
Celebrating Christmas
Why can't you see what hurts so bad
How can you go without paying mind to my sorrow
You can't imagine
How I feel on this cold December night
Why aren't you next to me
Celebrating Christmas
Why can't you see what hurts so bad
How can you go without paying mind to my sorrow
You can't imagine
How I feel on this cold December night
I'll never let a day pass by without a prayer or two
That heaven find a way so I might just run into you
Just to be near you and to hear you say hello
Would give an ordinary day a lovely glow
I'll never let a day pass by but that I'll see your face
And thrill to every tender sigh while you're in my embrace
I know it's all a dream but darling, if it were true
I'll never let a day pass by without my loving you
I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)

And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

Yeah, I'm sorry I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an X-box and I'm more Atari
Mmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
(Oh, shit she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know, nigga)

Ooohooohooo
I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)

And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep you trying to please you
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

Now I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
(Oh, shit she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know, nigga)

Ooohooohooo
I've got some news for you
Oooh, I really hate your ass right now

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

Now baby, baby, baby
Why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)

I tried to tell my mama but she told me:
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did

(Oh!) Why? (Oh!), why?
(Oh!) Why? (Oh!), why, lady?

Oho, I love you (Oh!)
I still love you
Oh!

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
Fuck you!
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)

And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down (When the sun goes down)
And the bats are back to bed (And the bats are back)
The brothers come 'round (The brothers come 'round)
I get out of my dirty bed (My dirty bed)
I shake my pretty little head (I shake my pretty little head)
Tap my pretty little feet (Tap my pretty little feet)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feeling brighter than sunlight
(Oh) Louder than thunder
(Oh) Bouncing like a yo-yo, woo

[Verse 2]
Don't got no problems (No problems)
Ain't got no suitcase (No suitcase)
Ain't got no clothes to worry about (No clothes to worry about)
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry
Or gold mines to hang me up (No real estate)
I just throw in my hand (Throw in his hand)
With the chilliest bunch in the land (In the land)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They don't look much
(Oh) They sure chilly chilly
(Oh) They positively glow, glow, ha!

[Chorus]
Chilly down with the Fire Gang
Think small with the Fire Gang (It's the only way)
Bad hep with the Fire Gang
(A smile a day keeps the doctor away)
When your thing gets wild, chilly down
Chilly down with the Fire Gang (Hey, I'm a wild child)
Act tall with the Fire Gang (Woo, walk tall)
Good times, bad food (Yeah)
When your thing gets wild, chilly down, chilly down

[Bridge]
Drivin' crazy, really lazy
Eye rollin', funky strollin'
Ball playin', hip swayin'
Trouble makin', booty shakin'
Tripping, passing, jumping, bouncing
Drivin', stylin', creepin', pouncing
Shoutin', screamin', double dealin'
Rockin', rollin', and a-reelin'
With the mackin' sex appealin'
Can you dig our groovy feelin'?

[Verse 3]
So when things get too tough (Get too tough)
And your chin is dragging on the ground
(Dragging on the ground)
And even down looks up (Down looks up)
Bad luck (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!)
We can show you a good time (Show you a good time)
And we don't charge nothin' (Nothin' at all)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Just strut your nasty stuff
(Oh) And wiggle in the middle, yeah
(Oh) Get the town talkin', Fire Gang

[Chorus]
Chilly down with the Fire Gang (Think small)
Think small with the Fire Gang (Bad hep!)
Bad hep with the Fire Gang (Hey, listen up)
When your thing gets wild, chilly down
Chilly down with the Fire Gang (Ah, shake your pretty little head)
Act tall with the Fire Gang (Tap your pretty little feet)
Good times, bad food (Come on, come on!)
When your thing gets wild, chilly down

[Chorus/Outro]
Chilly down with the Fire Gang (Woo!)
Think small with the Fire Gang
Bad hep with the Fire Gang

Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future ain't hard to tell

Break:

I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
I love the woman
I just can't stand to leave her be
Now we got to get married
An' might even raise a whole family

Watch out for me, woman, an'
And don't mind nobody else
Watch out for me, woman
And don't mind nobody else
Ain't got no crystal ball
But the future - ain't hard to tell

[Intro]
So who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
I can see it in his eyes, yeah that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

[Chorus]
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around

[Verse 2]
And look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and

[Chorus]
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah they said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

[Outro]
What a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all
On the day that I was born
Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day
Which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel
Rolling loaded dice
Ace of spades behind his ear
And him not thinking twice

Half-step
Mississippi Uptown Toodleloo
Hello baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old southern sky
I'm on my way - on my way

If all you got to live for
Is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge
And seal that silver mine
I lost my boots in transit babe
Pile of smoking leather
Nailed a retread to my feet
And prayed for better weather
Half-step

Mississippi Uptown Toodleloo
Hello baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old southern sky
I'm on my way - on my way

They say that when your ship comes in
The first man takes the sails
The second takes the afterdeck
The third the planks and rails
What's the point in callin shots?
This cue ain't straight in line
Cueball's made of styrofoam
And no one's got the time

Half-step
Mississippi Uptown Toodleloo
Hello baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old southern sky
I'm on my way - on my way

Across the Rio Grand-eo
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grand-eo
Across the lazy river
His Daddy was a simple man, just a red dirt Georgia farmer
And his Momma spent her young life havin' kids and balin' hay
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander
So he hopped a freight in Waycross and wound up in L.A

Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry, then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called "Shame"?

Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings brought meaning to his life
Yes, the night before she left sleep came and left that Waycross, Georgia boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sunday morning found him standin' neath the red light at her door
When a right cross sent him reelin', put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
Who growled, "Your Georgia neck is red but sonny, you're still green"?

He turned twenty-one in a gray rock fed'ral prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross, Georgia boy
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence he would listen
To that midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy
Sunday mornin' found him standin' 'neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side, he cried, "Have you seen Mabel Joy?"?
Stunned and shaken someone said, "Why, she's not here no more
She left this house four years today, they say she's lookin' for some Georgia farm boy"?
I turn the music up
(20x)
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
On the water down in New Orleans
My baby's the pearl of the quarter
She's a charmer like you've never seen
Singing voulez voulez voulez-vous

Where the sailor spends his hard-earned pay
Red beans and rice for a quarter
You can see her almost any day
Singing voulez voulez voulez-vous

And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her that I said hello
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go

I walked alone down the miracle mile
I met my baby by the shrine of the martyr
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
Singing voulez voulez voulez-vous
She loved the million dollar words I'd say
She loved the candy and flowers that I bought her
Said she loved me and was on her way
Singing voulez voulez voulez-vous

And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her that I love her so
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 1]
Saw you on a Sunday afternoon
Riding the B train
Yes, I was coolin' on the B train
You had an air about you
I had to know and soon
First sight and I didn't
Even mind the rain
Your glow was the ailment
To all my pain inside
I sat beside your body and asked your name
Your fragrance made it hard to explain my plight
Of how you're driving me insane

[Chorus]
Jezzebel don't know you well
I can't believe how my feelings took over
But I'd like to
Let me let you know that I'm on
And I want you
Aiming to please just let me show you

[Verse 2]
The moment that you opened up your lips
I knew that you were the one
Hope you don't mind if I touch your fingertips
Please don't draw the line just yet
I promise I won't go too far
Cause you've been haunting me
Ever since I saw your face
I can't escape you now
Be mine and wait and see love
Many people search their whole life for
Here to let you know babe
That I'm real, oh so real

[Chorus]
Jezzebel don't know you well
I can't believe how my feelings took over
But I'd like to
Let me let you know that I'm on
And I want you
Aiming to please just let me show you

[Breakdown]
Wanna get to know you
Don't know your nationality
Can we converse and see
When a good time to get together
Baby...am I being a little fast
No, I don't know
Maybe so I don't think so
In fact I don't care
All I want to do is touch your hair
And taste your air
What perfume are you wearing
Oh, oh the smell

[Chorus]
Jezzebel don't know you well
I can't believe how my feelings took over
But I'd like to
Let me let you know that I'm on
And I want you
Aiming to please just let me show you
If you can't do no better, think I'd better get another that can
Yes, if you can't do no better, think I'd better get another that can
You know you're going around and cheap on me
You're doing nothing but losing a good man

You know life is too short to be worry, and I think you are not to understand
Yeah, life is too short to be worry think you are not to understand
You're keep going around and cheap on me
You ain't doing nothing but losing a good man

If I never said hello to you baby then I won't be say good bye
Hey, if I never said hello to you baby then I won't be say good bye
I got my cloths already packed now
I'm so hurt, I wanna cry

Oh, can you hear me, hear me baby?
Can you hear me?
Oh, I got my cloths
My cloths already packed now
I'm so hurt, I wanna cry
I wanna know why you treat me like you do baby
I wanna never tell me why
Yes, if you can't do me no better baby, think I'd better get another baby that can
Yes, if you can't do me no better baby, think I'd better get another baby that can
The way you treat me now baby, you ain't doing nothing but losing a good man

Hey, life is too short to be worry and I think you are not to understand
Hey, I say life is too short to be worry and I think you are not to understand
The way you treat me now baby, you ain't doing nothing but losing a good man

What you say now!
(Verse 1)
Right on, Mother
You've really blown my mind
I never thought we'd hit it off until today
Right on, Mother
You know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real

(Bridge)
I never thought you'd dig it
So sure you'd hit the roof
And now you're telling me you understand

(Chorus)
That I'm a man
Ba ba-ba ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Right on, Mother
You know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real
(Bridge)
Never thought you'd dig it
So sure you'd hit the roof
And now you're telling me you understand

That I'm a man
Ba ba-ba ba ba
Ba ba-ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba

(Verse 2)
Goodnight, Siobhán
I'll see you in the morning
Me and Moira got a good thing on
'Cause she thinks it's grand

(Chorus)
That I'm a man
Ba ba-ba ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Right on, Mother
You know the way I feel
Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real

(Outro)
Ba ba ba-ba
Ba ba-ba ba ba
Ba ba-ba-ba ba ba ba ba ba

[Verse 1]
Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
But be alive
I know that we will
The world keeps on moving but I'm holdin' still

[Verse 2]
In the beginning, I was far away and praying for my destiny
That would arrive
The moment you're born
For we will be here when the miracle comes

[Chorus]
Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love

[Bridge]
We are of age, we are in time, we are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth, I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine

[Verse 3]
I been over I been under
I don't own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
Believe in the soul and the magic of you

[Chorus]
Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love

[Bridge]
We are of age, we are in time, we are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth, I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine

[Chorus]
Living eyes
When under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes
When out in the rain will fall
The day I deny
The face of my love
Living eyes
When under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes
When out in the rain will fall
The day I deny
The face of my love
The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
The you and I came wandering by, and lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly
Relatively speaking you make me who I am
I need you exactly like the ocean needs the land
I need you like the sunshine needs the shadows and the night
I need you the way love needs the savage hurtful fight

Relatively speaking I'm nothing without you
You are where I've been before you are where I'm going to
You are living out my dreams and you are all my fears
You evoke my laughter, you unleash every tear

The rich ones need the poor ones
The blind need those with sight
Sinners need the pure of heart
The black ones need the white

Relatively speaking the contrast makes it go
Every action taken is related in the flow
Stars and losers, kings and fools go dancing hand in hand
Relatively speaking you make me who I am

The sick ones need the well ones
The living need the dead
Heaven needs its hell you know
And love needs lonely beds
Relatively speaking the contrast makes it go
Every action taken is related in the flow
Stars and losers, kings and fools go dancing hand in hand
Relatively speaking you make me who I am
Who I am
Dear face will hold no sweeter smile for me
Were you not mine, how dark the world would be
I know no light above that could replace
Love's radiant sunshine in your dear face

Give me your smile, the love light in your eyes
I could not hold a fairer paradise
Give me the right to love you all the while
My world forever, the sunshine of your smile

[Verse 1]
I want to paint a picture, Botticelli style
Instead of Venus on a clam, I'd paint this flower child
You are the air my flowers breathe, he calls, and the ladies turn around
On the first day of Spring, I'm looking at the only joy around

[Chorus]
He's the only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
The only joy in town

[Verse 2]
The Spanish steps are crowded, bunch of bodies brooding there
Deadpan sidewalk vendors hustling vacant stares
Making all the more exceptional this fool in a flower crown
On the first day of Spring, I'm looking at the only joy in town

[Chorus]
He's the only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
The only joy in town, Botticelli black boy
Botticelli black boy

[Verse 3]
The Botticelli black boy with the fuchsias in his hair
Is breathing in women like oxygen on the Spanish stairs
In my youth I would have followed him all through this terracotta town
On the first day of Spring, we'd dance and sing and be the only joy around

[Chorus]
We'd be the only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy in town, Botticelli black boy
He's the only joy I've found all day

[Verse 4]
At night these streets are empty, where does everybody go?
Where are the brash and tender rooms in Roman candle glow?
Where are Fellini's circus' La Dolce Vita clowns
On the first day of Spring, I'm looking at the only joy around

[Chorus]
The only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
He's the only joy in town

[Outro]
Botticelli black boy
He is the only joy in town, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
He is the only joy in town, Botticelli black boy

[Verse 1]
Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm tryna tell you something
Something that I already said

You like the pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who's tryna sell you something
Something that you already had

[Chorus]
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing

[Verse 2]
While the others talked
We were listening to lovers rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom

And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer

[Chorus]
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing

[Dialogue]
(Lafitte: "Now, how many men have you kissed?")
(Constance: "Very few.")
(Lafitte: "But you offered me a kiss. Why?")
(Constance: "Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you.")

[Outro]
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing
How big is your imagination
How much do you dream
Have you ever had a vision that seems so far to reach
But I ain't trying to preach to you
But I'm really concerned about the road you choose
Where are you going
What are you doing
What are you choosing
Why don't you

Let the melody you hear
Whisper softly in your ear
Telling you, you can do anything if you believe
Let the softness of my voice remind you that you got a choice
You can achieve anything if you believe

Now I know you gotta make your own decisions
You gotta make your own mistakes
But I'm watching you as you do what you do
And I see myself as I watch you cause
I did what you're doing when I was a kid
And I made the same mistakes
I been where you been
But you can change your destiny
If you listen to the words that I say
Let the melody you hear
Whisper softly in your ear
Telling you, you can do anything if you believe
Let the softness of my voice remind you that you got a choice
You can achieve anything if you believe

Anything is possible
Reachable, attainable
If you see your self as God sees you
I hope you're listening, 'cause

Let the melody you hear
Whisper softly in your ear
Telling you, you can do anything if you believe
Let the softness of my voice remind you that you got a choice
You can achieve anything if you believe
For every little kiss there's a little teardrop
For every single thrill there's another heartache
The road is rough
The going gets tough

Yes love is a hurtin' thing
And oh love is a hurtin' thing

When you're in my arms I'm king on a throne
But when we're apart I walk the streets all alone
One day happiness
The next day loneliness

Yes love is a hurtin' thing
And oh love is a hurtin' thing

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring so much pain?
Yes it's a mystery that nobody can explain

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you
'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two
But I want you so
And I want you to know that
Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh sweet love
Oh sweet love

[Intro: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
This is for all the women
That have been stripped of their innocence
(She was daddy's little girl)
But no matter what, They kept their head up
And this is my way of saying thank you
(All alone in the world)

[Chorus: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
To find for herself 'cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

[Verse 1: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
I was raised by women, a woman made me a man
It's just too bad that a man took her innocence
And God knows that I, I would finish him
Diminish him, end up killin' him
Blame it on the ignorance; that's where her childhood went
New country, new language, that's how seven years were spent
Time; you can't buy it, and some lose 'em here
I know that we bumped heads, just know Mom, that I'm here
Cuban Peter Pan, the rebelution was crazy
I wanna thank you Mom, for the way you raised me
All your life, you wanted only one thing
And that was to say (She was daddy's little girl)

[Chorus: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
To find for herself 'cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

[Verse 2: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
Took care of me, just like a mother
Till you got pregnant, then you was off to Georgia
It was tough how we, how we were brought up
Tougher for you, 'cause you had no father
Now I understand, now that I'm a man
How much a woman needs someone to call dad
You cut through the pain, you walked through the rain
The game ain't playin' you, baby, you play the game
Now you're in search of that father figure
And if you find him, he denies you
Jenny, fuck that nigga
Karma's a bitch, even though I know she wish
(She was daddy's little girl)

[Chorus: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
Confused and don't know what to think
'Cause she thought that she was (She was daddy's little girl)
To find for herself 'cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl (Daddy's little girl)
She was daddy's little girl

[Outro: Pitbull & (Slim of 112)]
This is for all the women that stayed strong
And beat all the odds (She was daddy's little girl)
The ones that have been raped, the ones that grew up fatherless
(All alone in the world)
But still found a way to raise their kids
To do the right thing (She was daddy's little girl)
This is for y'all, I love y'all (All alone in the world)

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place
(You can't run, you can't hide, you can't run, you can't hide)
Love has problems, I know, but they're problems, we'll just have to face
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back (Don't look back)
And don't look back (Don't look back), oh yeah, yeah
And don't look back, baby (Don't look back)
(The past is behind you, don't let them remind you)

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done

[Chorus: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking, don't look back (Don't look back)
Forget about the past now
Don't look back, baby (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and don't look back, mmm (Don't look back)
(The past behind you, don't let them remind you)

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
Love can be a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down
Oh yeah, yeah
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby
The second time around
Oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Paul Williams & (The Temptations)]
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing and don't look back (Don't look back)
Now, what'd I say, we won't look back, girl (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back
Forget about the past now, baby (Don't look back)
And don't look back (Don't look back)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back
I'm Pedro the fisherman
I fish by night and day
Unfortunately i live in Bristol
Far far away

And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The council came
Away from me

I'm Pedro the fisherman
With not a fish to fash
I've got a hook on the line
A big mac, a big hat
Some socks, a pair of wellingtons
And a bit of wine
(A lot of wine)

So I'm going to go
She wears loafer shoes, a dungaree
Red jacket shirt if you please
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

Now she digs that music with a beat
Rock 'n' rollin' is her need
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

On Saturday night she comes to town
She plays the jukebox, let her hair hung down
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl
Let 'em roll..

She digs some cherries, she can milk a cow
Don't like squares, though daddy taught her how
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl
She's up every mornin' about half past five
She likes to go fishin' 'cause it keeps you alive
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

Now when she's dancin' the kids hang around
They dig my baby 'cause she really goes to town
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

Yeah, man..

[Verse 1]
This is really something, people will be envious
But our roles aren't clear, so we mustn't rush
Still we're burning brightly, clinging like fire to fuel
I'm grinning like a fool

[Chorus]
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh, stay in touch
In touch

[Verse 2]
Part of this is permanent, part of this is passing
So we must be loyal and wary not to give away too much
'Til we build a firm foundation and empty out old habits
Old habits

[Chorus]
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh, stay in touch
In touch

[Bridge]
During times like these, the wise or influential
They can bear the imperfections, they can keep the money
No doubt about it, no doubt that's essential
No doubt that's always been a tricky one for me

[Verse 3]
So we should just surrender, let fate and duty shape us
Let light hearts remake us, let the worries hush
In the middle of this continent, in the middle of our time on Earth
We perceive one another

[Chorus]
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh, stay in touch
In touch

[Intro]
(Well)
Are you ready for me? Yeah
Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest
(Well, yes, take ya time brotha)
You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do, huh
Everywhere I go, (well) and everything I see
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass, yes
Can I talk about it?
(Talk on, talk on)
While you're looking, I suggest you take a good look
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for
(Amen)
Just like that song says, (well) ain't nobody's business what I do, now can I
Move on?
(Move on, move on, move on brotha Kelly)
I remember when I was tryna be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody
(I didn't know nobody, well)
But now, yeah
(Now)
I said now
(Now)
Can I say it again?
(Gon' and say it again)
Now, ever since God has blessed me, yeah, it seems that things are going a little bit different (yes it is)
Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes
Why, even the Statue of  Liberty want some bump and grind
Can I get a witness off up in them jeeps? (Amen)
I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth
Now, now, wait a minute, go that way
You see the good book says that the truth is the light, please, I think it's time
To turn on your lights and see the truth
Can, can I talk on? (Listen)
You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going
You don't know, what I do
Can I get a witness?
So before you go trying to pass judgment on me, pass judgment on yourself
Worry 'bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going
And who yourself has been with
That way, you (you)
You (you)
You, You don't have to ever worry about nobody, but Jesus
You're young for a golden moment, you sigh and it flies away
And then in the silent September, you dream of the music of May
You're young for a shining hour, but soon it's remember-when
Take hold of that golden moment
For once it's gone, it never comes back again

Take hold of that golden moment
For once it is gone, it never comes back
You cry, still it won't come back
It's gone and never comes back again
When I get older, losin' my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greeting, bottle of wine

If I got home at a quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still lead me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be happy fixing a fuse
Whe the lights are gone
You could knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride

Doin' the garden, diggin' the weeds
Who could ask for more
Will you still lead me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of White
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
You're sincerely wasting away

Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forever more
Will you still lead me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

Oh yeah

[Intro]
Oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Oh, she may be weary
Them young girls, they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, oh yeah
Oh, when she gets weary, try a little tenderness
Oh yes, oh yes, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
You know she's waiting, oh, just anticipating, oh
For the things she'll never posses, oh no no no, woah
While she's there waiting there without them
Try oh, just a little, oh, just a little, little, little tenderness
That's what I said, a little tenderness
Ha, oh na na na na na na
It's all you gotta do
It's not, haha, oh, just sentimental, no
She has, she has, she has
Her griefs and cares, oh woah
But the soft words, they spoke so gentle, yeah
And it makes it easier, easier to bare, hey
You won't regret it no
Them young girls, they don't forget it
Love is their own, their own, happiness, oh, oh, woah
But it's all, it's all, so simple now

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is try a little tenderness, oh, uh
Won't you show her won't her, won't you show her that you love her, hey
You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
You gotta, won't you, won't you try, just try a little tenderness, hey, ha
You gotta show her that you want it, no one above her now
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Hold her, grab her softly now
And try a little tenderness, hey
You oughta listen to me, don't leave, ha
Don't cheat her now
Squeeze her, don't cheat her, never leave her
Gotta show her na na na hey, hey, yeah, hey
Hey, hey
You got to know what to do, don't be a fool
You need to try this now

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Just try a little tenderness, a little tenderness
Take it from me you don't wanna let her leave, oh no
Squeeze her, don't tease, never leave
You gotta, won't you try
Just try, just try, a little tenderness, ha
Is there a witness in the building tonight? Ha, hey, hey, ha
You gotta, won't you, won't you try, just try a little tenderness
Say it with me, say it with me
Try a little tender, tender, tenderness
You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Hold her, grab her softly now
Just try a little
Just try a little
Just try a little, oh, oh, oh, no, uh

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, just try, ha
Just try, just try, ha, woo
You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her
If you hear what I'm saying this evening
Won't you just, just try?
Yeah, oh
I've been to town, I've walked the highways and in the suburbs too
I've done somethings I never thought I'd ever do
Now as I stand here looking down at you, you ask me why it is I frown
I guess it's 'cause I've been to town
I've been to town beyond the boulevard and down the beach
I've learned some things that only time can teach
For instance, love is more than just a speech
It's got to find a common ground
I know 'cause I've been to town
Don't tell me any more, I can't waste any more years
I've seen my image in your eyes
Dissolve in disappointed tears
I've been to town, you ask me do I know the Milky Way
I do, and furthermore I'd like to say
It isn't milky white, it's dingy gray
Especially when your world breaks down
I know because I've been to town
Now who you know leave the scene
Messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock
Throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
Then get back to me at your earliest convenience
Check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks
Seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
With a firm brush stroke I mc paintily
Lyricists begin crumbling from my scumbling technique
As I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
Cause me and rap go way back we compliment
So together we enhance one another that's common sense
High intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
Be a real critic not explicit with false props
I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough
With my churascurro inspiration spark and a knife
Now watch me rock the spot like ? minus the heroin
And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
Its kinda scary when real art gets left behind
While they take bullshit and start sellin it to blind folks
But I remain humble as long as ? continues spinnin hot shit
On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
F**k mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it
So open your eyes and listen
Combine your ears with vision
Or do it cause you love it
Or for cash that's your decision
That's your decision
That's your decision

Its like I'm torn between two worlds
A paintbrush and a microphone
A canvas or a beat
CD or LP
Anything goes when my ink pen flows
And God only knows where its gonna bring me next
So I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed
And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
You know the cycle ass ho don't front
It goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
Like back and forth and forth and back
Should I paint a picture or record a track
A gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
But over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
And those that lack the passion I have may despise it
But my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
So tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
Tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
And tell Bob Ross for all the happy little trees
And tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine
Although hes running out of patience but his mind is free
And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
And that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be
They say there was a secret chord
That David played, and pleased the Lord
You don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lifts
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your faith, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the
Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well you say I took the name in vain
I didn't even know the name
And if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter what you heard
The broken or the holy Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

This is the future of an illusion
Aggressive culture of despotism
Living fantasy of the immortal
The reality of an animal

This is the future of an illusion
Aggressive culture of despotism
Living fantasy of the immortal
The reality of an animal
Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys

Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Holding hands across an episode
Hours after you had hit the road

There are
There are a few
There are
There are a few of us who wait around for

Afternoons around the lazy lawn
Calling ducks to shoot them off the pond
Clearly it's a waste of time
No they're not real shells
Just that there is nothing else to do

Maybe we should wait for you

There are
There are a few
There are
There are a few of us who wait around for
Visions of a beauty that I used to see
Through a garden window a lover showed to me
Melting on the mirror in a most seductive pool
Maybe we could take a dip or two

Maybe we should wait for you

There are
There are a few
There are
There are a few of us who wait around for

Maybe we should wait for you

There are
There are a few
There are
There are a few of us who wait around for

(We're waiting.. we're waiting.. we're waiting.. we're waiting)
(We're waiting .. we're waiting.. we're waiting.. we're waiting)

To see if mountains ever ever move
See if miracles come true

See if mountains ever ever move
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby, try me and I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all
You like to kiss and run and that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you love was
Heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all, baby, no, no
I wanna say
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

Laying in the alleyway
Maybe some rich fool will come my way
And throw me a dime
Tthat's all I need to give me more wine
All I got is to my name
Is a beat up guitar with three broken strings
And I sure know I'm just ain't taking care of no business
Lookie here

Hey kitty cat! Where you going?
This part of the alley is my home
Walking all over outside my wall
Boy you sure got a whole lotta dogs
I had a sandwich in a paper bag
But a rat stole it, ain't that some drag?
Lord, I know, I know I sure ain't taking care of no business
Play the horn

Now try to give me a job
Feeding chickens and washing down hogs
But that meant standing up all the time
And standing up to me is just like dying
I'm so lazy that I, I could cry
But tears are just too lazy to fall out my eyes
Lord, lord, lord, lord, I'm so messed up, can't even take care of no business
Play it one more time
Yeah!
Oh, woe is me
I sure wish I had me a sandwich
Anything
I'm so broke I can't even pay attention
Uh, I'm so poor I couldn't even give you the time
Do do do do do do do do do
This is a Christmas remix

And it's sang
La la la la la la la la la la
Baby

Did you get my card
Did you read my love letter
Did it touch your heart
When you read my love letter

Pour the wine, read the signs
Baby, it's Christmas time
You and me underneath this tree
Candle stories told
Kisses under mistletoe
And everyone's asking their family

Did you get my card (Christmas card)
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter)
Did it touch your heart (Did it touch your heart, girl)
When you read my love letter (My Christmas love letter)
Sleigh bells, sweet dreams

Cuz, this moment's so heaven sent
Marshmallows, hot chocolate
FIreplace, you and me cuddling

Did you get my card (Christmas card)
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter)
Did it touch your heart (Did it touch your heart, girl)
When you read my love letter (My Christmas love letter)

(My hope is) I hope these words find you
I wrote this letter according to my love for you
So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are
You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box
Though near or far, I will find a way to send my love
Only pray that it don't come back turned into cinder
If you are reading this I hope that things are well
And you can text me back, or write me back just check your mail

Did you get my card (My Christmas card, yea baby)
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter, girl)
Did it touch your heart (When you read it)
When you read my love letter (My love)

[Intro: The Temptations]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
To get stones from a rock, you've got to break it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
To get bread from dough, you've got to bake it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
To get water from a faucet, you've got to turn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)

[Post-Chorus: The Temptations]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
To get fire from a match, you've got to strike it
(Strike it, strike it, strike it, strike it)
To get the feeling from a kiss, you've got to like it
(Like it, like it, like it, like it)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
To get ashes from wood, you've got to burn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)

[Bridge: Eddie Kendricks]
You've got to treat me kind, all the time
Throw the other guys right out of your mind, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
Now listen
To make broken things work, you've got to fix them
(Fix them, fix them, fix them, fix them)
To make two things one, you've got to mix them
(Mix them, mix them, mix them, mix them)

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
To get butter from milk, you've got to churn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)

[Outro: Eddie Kendricks & (The Temptations)]
If you deserve it you can get it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)
I'll be glad to see you with it (Earn it, earn it, earn it)
Just show me that you love me (Earn it, earn it, earn it)
And that you're thinking of me (Earn it, earn it, earn it)
You can get it in a hurry
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme
Oh, until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
There she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground
Heaven knows my daytime girl
Never been kissed she don't know what she's missing
All the kisses there are to be found
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed
What a dream this place has been
Said when she left I believed when I saw him
All the seeing believing come true
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed
There she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground
Up in the mornin', Out on the job, work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do, but roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids, sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do, but roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll around heaven all day
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll around heaven all day

Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

Well I am what I am thank you
Some people just don't understand
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool babe
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
'Cause in the eyes of god
You're both children to him
Everybody come alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die."
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin', to watch him die, you know he had to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
He had to die, you know he had to die
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha
On the playback Bob, I want piano and bass
OK, here we go

One, two, a-one, two, three
(I'll just start it)

Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh

Get on your board my big surfer boy
Ride all the waves that come by
I'm on my board little surfer girl
Out on...
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Hello, young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you
Be brave. (Be brave)
Young lovers, why don't you come home
Follow your sorrow. (Oh, yeah)
Be brave and faithful and true. (Be brave and faithful and true)
Be very close to each other tonight. (Whoa, yeah)
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly, and to fly, and to fly down the street in a trance
In a trance, in a trance, in a trance
Fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet
And you'll meet, not ready by chance. (?)
Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
Don't cry because I'm all alone, now
All of my memories are happy tonight
I had a love of my own
I had a love of my own, like yours
I had a love of my own
Hello, young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
Don't cry because I'm all alone, now
All of my memories are happy tonight
I had a love of my own
I had a love of my own, like yours
I had a love of my own, like yours
I had a love of my own, like yours
I had a love of my own
Hello young lovers whoever you are
Hello young lovers whoever you are
Hello young lovers whoever you are
Hello young lovers whoever you are
Hello
Hello
Hello
Poor little bastard
Where is your papa now?
I don't think he'd be too proud
Of people laughing out loud
At his little baby
Shamelessly working the crowd
Poor little baby
Where is your papa now?

Poor little blind one
Can't U see through the lies
Why must U patronize
While I'm waiting by your side
2 make U happy
While others make U cry
Poor little blind one
Why can't I be your eyes?

I've always loved U
Like the stars will love the moon
Like a singer loves a tune that's in her key
U're just right 4 me
Poor little bastard
If there's a place in the sun
Faster than anyone
That's where I would run
Whenever U call
I'll be there 2 break your fall
Poor little bastard - I'll be your papa now {x2}
As long as there's music and words of romance
The spell of a theme starts
You to dream there's always a chance
As long as there's music, whatever the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

They think I'm bad and I treat her so mean
But all they know is from what they've seen
And when I get her alone now
You know we're happy as a couple could be
And when I give her my love it's between her and me

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

Some guys may think they'd be better for her
But she knows just what she wants for sure
And when we're out with our friends now
You know that we never have to put on a show
And we stay together while other couples come and go
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
How Many More Years, have I got to let you dog me around
How many more years, have I got to let you dog me around
I'd soon rather be dead, sleeping six feet in the ground

I'm gonna fall on my knees, I'm gonna raise up my right hand
I'm gonna fall on my knees, I'm gonna raise up my right hand
Say I'd feel much better darling, if you'd just only understand

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I say I love you, I don't know
Loving without trusting, you get frostbite and sunstroke
I wish I felt nothing, you pimp, laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat
Your old off night back street

[Verse 2]
It's been stinger to stinger, darling, it's been heart to heart
You still keep me from finishing any new love I start
Now she's moved in with you, she's keeping your house neat
And your sheets sweet and I'm your off night back street

[Verse 3]
I can feel your fingers feeling my face
There are some lines you put there and some you erase
Maybe I'm just dramatizing, I don't care
It's home, it can be heaven when we play fair
But these sentimental journeys late at night, high in some back room
You're calling me to be your off night back street

[Outro]
You give me such pleasure
You bring me such pain
Who left her long black hair
In our bathtub drain?
I'm a man on fire
It's a burning thing
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby
I'm a man on fire
An eternal flame
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby, oh ...

Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour
Heart of a women and just a little bit of pulling power
The feelings got me
I don't know what it means
I know it must be wrong
But when you love somebody you dream
And I dream
I save the love down deep inside me
For the moment when you come
And you're there, and you're gone
And I'm alive for you
And my love keeps hanging on
There is no life
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world
Together we are strong in love
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be
And me, I'm a man on fire

I'm a man on fire
It's a burning thing
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby
I'm a man on fire
An eternal flame
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby, oh...

Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done
I'm not a beginner
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on
Nothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need
Woman when you need somebody
A woman with a face and a body, you dream
And I dream

I save the love down deep inside me
For the moment when you come
And you're there and you're gone
And I'm alive for you
And my love keeps hanging on
There is no life
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love
There is no unifying
If I don't hear you crying
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world
Together we are strong enough
And when your storm is over
I'll show how warm my love can be
And me, I'm a man on fire

I'm a man on fire
It's a burning thing
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby
I'm a man on fire
An eternal flame, oh baby
Don't you know that I'm burning up
(it's a burning thing)
In the flame of your love

Don't you know that I'm burning up
(It's a burning thing)
In the flame of your love

Don't you know that I'm burning up
(it's a burning thing)
Don't you know that I'm burning up
(it's a burning thing)
Wait till you see her
See how she looks
Wait till you hear her lie

Painters of painting
Writers of books
Never could tell the height

Wait till you feel the warmth of her glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free her
When you see her, you won't believe your eyes

Wait till you feel the warmth of her glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free her
When you see her, you won't believe your eyes
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again

You don't know what it means to win
Come down and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
Pee-rac-ti-cal-I-ty de-us-n't int'rest me
Love the life that I lead
I've got a pocketful of miracles
And with a pocketful of miracles
One miracle a day is all I need!

Tree-rou-bles, more or less
Bee-ah-ther me, I guess when the sun doesn't shine
But there's a pocketful of miracles
The world's a bright and shiny apple that's mine, all mine

I hear sleigh bells ringing, smack!
I go around like there's a snow around
I feel so good, it's Christmas every day!

Lee-ife's a carousel, fee-ar as I can tell
And I'm riding for free

So if you're down and out of miracles
I've got a pocketful of miracles
And there'll be miracles enough for you, and me
Kids Choir: I hear sleigh bells ringing

Frank: Smack in the middle of May, I go around like theres snow
Around

Kids Choir: I feel so good its Christmas every day

Frank: Lee-ifes a carousel, fee-ar as I can tell, and i'm ridin' for free

Kids Choir: I've got a pocketful of miracles

Frank: But if I had to pick a miracle, my favorite miracle of all is you love
Me

[Verse 1]
Gucci make money
That's what you call money
Small money mall money you ain't got no money
Black cars stupid guwap got that white folk money money
Six day work week smoke break on Sunday
So country country cash out hundreds
Dropped 70 on my Hummer but that ain't bout nothing
So country country cash out hundreds
So country country cash out hundreds
Dropped 70 on my Hummer but that ain't bout nothing
60 g's on the Vet but that wasn't no stuntin'
Bart Simpson chain appraised at a clean 100
Mighty mouse charm appraised at just 50
Have it shine like Diddy's
Cross em up like Bibby
Many men wanna kill me but I'm not 50
I'mma take one with me let me know who with me
Who you with mutherfucker blood in no envy
When the fed's snatched me I said I had no memory
I’m tha hottest thang to hit patchwerk this century
Used to have a 10 speed now I'm riding a bentley(yeeeeaaaa)

[Hook]
This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter
The water boys just go and get the water
Damn you a reflection of your father(yeah)
This for the bench warmers
Your daddy say he wish he had a daughter
Damn you a reflection of your father
I bet that you wish you was a baller (GUCCI)

[Verse 2]
Gucci godfather, flow just like water
Never bought s-dot carter's
I rock with a new jack swag so I rock more harder
One thang I never do is kiss my partner
No kunta kinte more like shaka (shaka zulu)
We don't shoot arrows we shoot chopper's
No voo-doo priest psychic or which doctor can predict
When gucci gone get off ya
La costra nostra
Glock's and holsters
Roaches, witches, rats and vultures
To get it out of victim we might use torture my
Saucers got million's so I keep lawyer's
You derail us, we'll destroy ya
Big boss man, Never been no worker
Mojo gettin paid just to roll up purple
Gotta be a boss to get in my circle
Got to get it off or the click might murk ya
You gotta be a boss to get in this circle
You gotta get it off or my click might murk ya pussy!

[Hook]
This for the bench warmers
Get off the bench and try to be a starter

Damn you a reflection of your father I bet that u wish you was a baller (GUCCI)

[Verse 3]
What's up Jeezy and what's up Kiki
Them weak ass niggas couldn't hurt my pinky
Trying to kill the kid nigga, what you thinking?
Stop Gucci breathing you must be dreaming
Somebody pinch me cause I'm not sleeping
Black man found slain and I'm not weeping
No surrender, Fuck retreating
Spies in the operation, I smell treason
I never killed the man cause I had no reason
Dope game hard and you still hadn't Meechie
I never killed the man cause I had no reason
The dope game hard and you still lil jeezy pussy

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The roll of the harbour wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes and he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver

[Chorus 1]
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his sea dreams come to me

[Verse 2]
City satins left at home, I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea, your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets, he said, and come to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down 'till the rain delights you
You do not hide, sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden

[Chorus 2]
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his sea dreams come to me

[Verse 3]
Seabird, I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings, I have brought some dreams to share

[Pre-Chorus 3]
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby

[Chorus 3]
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his sea dreams come to me
All his sea dreams come to me

[Verse 1]
Freight train, freight train, runnin' so fast
Freight train, freight train, runnin' so fast
Please, don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm goin'

[Verse 2]
When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times here I crave
Place stones by my head and feet
Tell 'em all that I've gone to sleep

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When I die, Lord, bury me deep
Way down on old Chestnut Street
I can hear Old Number 9
As she comes passin' by

[Verse 4]
Freight train, freight train, runnin' so fast
Freight train, freight train, runnin' so fast
Please, don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm goin'
Please, don't tell what train I'm on
They won't know what route I'm goin'
I'm not a poet
And I know it
There is no deep secret
Tossing inside me

I have no timing
I can't form my feelings
Sometimes I rhyme
Sometimes I don't

So go ahead, take a look at my kitchen
Take a look at the woodgrain there
What's it for? That hardwood floor
Is where I'm walkin' and thinkin'

Walkin' and thinkin'

About you
We're just a kiss apart, and yet we dance on and on
We're just a kiss apart, and soon our chance will be gone
Now you're beside my heart, your eyes have started to shine
Oh but I know too well, daybreak may break the spell
So while we're just a kiss apart, kiss me and tell me you're mine

We're just a kiss apart, and soon our chance will be gone
Now you're beside my heart, your eyes have started to shine
Oh but I know too well, daybreak may break the spell
So while we're just a kiss apart, kiss me and tell me
Yes, kiss me and tell me you're mine
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore...
I've got a right to love my baby
Oh, she treats me just like a king
Hey, I've got a right to love my baby
I said she treats me just like a king
Oh, she eases my mind, body and soul
My baby, she can do most anything

Oh, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people
She's my all around standby
Hey, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble
And she's my mother when I wanna cry
I've got a right to love my baby
Hey, can't you see the reason why?

That gives me a right to love my baby
She's always here by my side
Hey, my sweet undersanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
And when it comes to kind treatment people
My baby's an angel in disguise
Well, when I'm sick she's my doctor
When I'm well she's my pride and joy
Hey, when I'm cold
When I'm cold she's my cover
And she calls me "my little baby boy"
When I'm tired and wanna play, people
It's my baby that's my toy
The glow of sunset in the summer skies
The golden flicker of the fireflies
The gleam of love light in your lovely eyes
These are the things I love

A silver moonbeam peeping through the trees
A bed of tulips nodding in the breeze
The look you give in answer to my pleas
These are the things I love

Oh, once I thought that Life was just a winter thing
My heart was cold, and then
You came to me and like a breath of spring
You turned the silver snow to gold!

A robin's serenade when day is through
A bubbling brook beside our rendezvous
Your sweet voice whisp'ring "Darling, I love you"
These are the things I love
(Frank Sinatra)
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

(Elvis Prelsey)
Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

(Frank Sinatra)
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will

(Elvis Presley)
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

(Frank Sinatra)
I love you
And I always will

(Elvis and Frank)
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will
This boxcar's been my home since St Antone
'Cause this ankle of mine I turned while hoppin' on
Shoots pain that feeds my dreams with luxuries
I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy

I can feel my mother's heartbeat from the track
It's the rhythm of a son that won't be back
Lord knows where my mind is takin' me
I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy

If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
Just to be here on this train once again
Freedom of a hobo ain't so bad you can dream of all the wealth you might've had
I guess livin' on this train is gettin' to me I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy

If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
Just to be here on this train once again
If there's nothing in this world I've gotta do
But to ride these rails of steel my whole life through

Then take away these visions that I see of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
Of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
She walks in the field that's just across the way
And picks all the flowers that brighten up a day
And the blue velvet cape that she wore around her neck
And the red in her cheeks gave a Rag Doll effect

The wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad song
I lie in my bed listenin' all night long
A wind in the trees sing a song just for me
And bring back the Rag Doll to me

Oh, how I long to have her back here by my side
The happiness of yesterday, it damn near cost my pride
There ain't nothin' worse than losin' when you've everything to gain
I've just got to get that woman back or nothing will be the same

The wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad, sad song
I lie in my bed listenin' all night long
A wind in the trees sing a song just for me
And bring back the Rag Doll to me
And bring back the Rag Doll to me
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

I thought, as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled so along they unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men
(Peace on earth, good will to men)

And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth," I said
"For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men."
(Peace on, peace on, peace on, peace on earth)
Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men

[Verse 1]
In reply to your request
Please find
I hereby protest
To the ways and means you use
You know
I cannot refuse

So I'll take this vow
Of loyalty
Fight for the right
You have said
To be free

[Guitar solo 1]

[Verse 2]
When this time has run its course
I must
Live without remorse
For the deeds I'm bound to do
I know
It's all the same to you
But I won't forget
The memory
Taking a life
For a life
To be free

[Guitar solo 2]
Hear that music playing, listen to what it's saying
Throughout the years I've made a lot of friends
Many became famous, most of them go nameless
But I dedicate this song to all of them
I've sung with the best and I've had it all
I've gone from neighborhood saloons to Carnegie Hall
I've been down and out and I've been in demand
But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!

Those magical notes, those musical pearls
I've sung with all the Counts, the Dukes, the Kings, and the Earls
And the experience, I have to say, was grand
But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!

Strings soaring, horns boring
Drums pounding in my ear

To start at the ground and reach for the top
To have such a wonderful career, I just gotta stop
Stop and turn around to thank everyone that sits on the stand
`cause I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!
Here's to those ladies and the gentlemen
*Here's to the AF of M
I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!
Here's to the band!

[Verse 1]
When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
"Now what's the matter buddy
Ain't you heard of my school?
It's number one in the state"
(Hey, hey take it away, get that ball and fight!)

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Just like you would to your girl, guys
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Be true to your school now
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
And let your colors fly
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Be true to your school

[Verse 2]
I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got my decal in back

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Just like you would to your girl, guys
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Be true to your school now
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
And let your colors fly
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Be true to your school
(Do it again, do it again, we like it, we like it!)

[Verse 3]
Come Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

[Chorus]
So be true to your school now
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Just like you would to your girl, guys
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Be true to your school now
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
And let your colors fly
(Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah)
Be true to your school
(Push 'em back, push 'em back, way back!)

[Outro]
Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah
Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah
Rah, rah, rah, rah, sis boom bah
It's like 1993
And it's weird as hell to me
Before they send me out
They'll have to alter
Alter me
I've done it lots before
But I don't need to ride no more
This spoof reality
Is just like outer space to me

I told you
Don't be buying no more rides
Till you got this ticket
You ain't been alive
Oooh it's awful
I did not think I would survive
Got off so fast
Had to kiss my past goodbye

It's like 1993
And it's weird as hell to me
Before they send me out
They'll have to alter
Alter me
I've done it lots before
But I don't need to ride no more
This spoof reality
Is just like outer space to me
See you waiting in line there
Till they lead you to the gate
When the nurse arrives
The crowd can hardly wait
Then you blast off crash and it's over
And if you do not survive
Your body's there
But your head does not arrive

It's like 1993
And it's weird as hell to me
Before they send me out
They'll have to alter
Alter me
I've done it lots before
But I don't need to ride no more
This spoof reality
Is just like outer space to me

[Intro]
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 1 - Wanyá ]
Hey, it's another Christmas Holiday
It's a joyous thing let the angels sing
Cause we're together
We got a thing here, can't let it slip away
Though outside is rain and sleet
When our bodies meet...
I don't care 'bout the weather

[Chorus: Nate, Boyz II Men]
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 2: Brian McNight]
Ohhhh, come over here and help me trim the tree
I wanna wrap you up baby
Then you'll see you're the only present I need
There's so much more
Waiting for you in store
From this precious day
I can gladly say
There's no place that I'd rather be

[Bridge: Wanyá, Boyz II Men]
And ohhh, you are my everything, come a little closer
God must have sent you down from heaven

[Chorus: Nate, Boyz II Men]
Let it snow, let it snow
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin'
So baby let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Outro Wanya, Boyz II Men]
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow baby, let it snow
I don't care about the weather baby
Let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow,
Let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow
I don't care 'bout the weather baby
All I need you to do is be with me baby
Let it snow
As long as you're here with me
Let it snow
I don't mind, I don't mind
Let it snow
I don't care what the weather may be
As long as you're here with me
When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
If you won't see me
You won't see me

I don't know why
You should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't gave much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me
Well...
Now he's staring at me like
As if he was starin in a mirror
She yells honey let me explain
He says you don't have to go no further
I can clearly see what's goin on
Behind my back, in my bed, in my home
Then I said wait a minute now hold on
I said mister we can work this out
She said honey don't lose control
Tried to get him to calm down
He said ho I should've known
That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house
But the Christian in me gave you the benefit of the doubt
I said we need to resolve this
Then he stepped to me, I'm like whoa
There's a reason I'm in this closet
He says, yeah like what, are you talkin clothes
I met this girl at the ?? club
And she told me she didn't have a man
Then he said man please
I'd kill you if you didn't have that gun in ya hand
And I said but yo chick chose me
He said don't give me that mack shit please
His phone goes off and then things get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer
I point my gun and says I'm not the one you after
He says somethin I bet you didn't know my man
Did she tell you that I was a pastor
I said well good that's betta right
Why can't we handle this Christian- like
And I started to put the gun down
Til I saw his face still had a frown
She started cryin, sayin baby I'm sorry
Then he said baby not as sorry as you're gonna be
I started inchin out
He says no I want you to see this
Said I gotta get out this house
He said not til I reveal my secret
I'm like what is goin on inside his head
Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says
Hello, Baby, turn the car around
Listen I just need for you to get right back here now (Click)
He looks at me and says well since we're all comin out the closet
I'm not about to be the only one that's broken hearted
She said what do you mean
And he said just wait and see
I said somebody betta talk to me
And then his phone rang
He picks up and somebody says sweetheart I'm downstairs
And he's like I'll buzz you up
I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs
And I'm like who is this mystery lady that you're talking to
He says in time you both will know the shockin truth
Baby this is something I been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time
Then I said now Imma shoot you both if you don't say what's on ya mind
He said wait I hear somebody comin up the stairs
And I'm lookin on the door
He says I think you betta sit down in the chair
I says I'm gonna count to four
1, he says mister wait
2, she says please don't shoot
3, he says don't shoot me
4, she screams
Then a knock at the door, the guns in my hands
He opens the door, I can't believe it's a man
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing, to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
But Louise she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up he speaks of her farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But even Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeeze, I can't find my knees."
Jewels and binoculars hag from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out
And say a prayer for him."
But like Louise always says "Ya can't look at much can ya man?"
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain
There not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind
Where you are, there is a different feeling
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin', opens up your eyes
What a shape ! Someone you can't forget for any time
Oh, let me show you mine, immediately

After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark

There is no limit that I would not go
If I could lie beside
Where you are, there is a different out there
Love in the jungle can be hard to realize
What a shape ! Someone you can't forget for any time
Oh, let me show you mine immediately
After dark where the lights are fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights are fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark

There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind
Where you are, there is a different feeling
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin' ,opens up your eyes
What a shape ! Someone you can't forget for any time
Oh, let me show you mine immediately

After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark

After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark

[Verse 1]
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone

[Verse 2]
The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes

[Verse 3]
The cause of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high

[Verse 4]
Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Has kindly assisted me home
And it feels so good inside
And I feel it, so alive and
Everything that feels so right
And I feel it so alive
Everything that feels so right (yeah yeah)

Everytime, everytime
Everytime we touch, I feel it

I feel it
Everytime we touch

Everytime we touch
Emotions that I can't contain
Are sweeping over me again
Everytime we touch
Sensations I can not explain
Are washing all away my pain
Everytime we touch
A magic spring from deep inside
Comes into me like breathe of light
Everytime we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Everytime we touch
Everytime we touch
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me

Everytime we touch (yeah)
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch

Ohh

Everytime you're near
And I feel so good inside (yeah)

Everytime we touch
The secrets of my beating heart
Are breaking free out of the dark
Everytime we touch
All the things I can't express
Feel me with such happiness
Everytime we touch
All the changes that helped me father
Broke and crumbling to the ground
Everytime we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Everytime we touch
Everytime we touch
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me

Everytime we touch (yeah)
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch

And it feels so good inside
And I feel it, so alive and
Everything that feels so right
And I feel it so alive
Everything that feels so right (yeah yeah)
Lost and alone on some forgotten highway
Travelled by many remembered by few
Lookin' for something that I can believe in
Lookin' for something that I'd like to do with my life

There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me
To somethin' that might have been true yesterday
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more
Than enough to just be here today

And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Lost and alone on some forgotten highway
Travelled by many remembered by few
Lookin' for something that I can believe in
Lookin' for something that I'd like to do with my life

There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me
To somethin' that might have been true yesterday
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more
Than enough to just be here today

And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air

Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Oh uh
I see fingers, hands and shades of faces
Reachin' up and not quite touchin' the promised land
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper sayin
Oh,Lord, please give us a helpin' hand
Yeah yeah

Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burnin
And all across the water,baby
I see weapons barkin' out the sting of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs jumpin' themselves
Laughin' they sayin'
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess

Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor
But as far as I know, they may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about lookin at the score
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
The preacher talked with me and he smiled
Said, "Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
Now, for once in your life, you're alone
But you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone"
I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart then won't you tell her I'm sorry?
And for once in my life I'm alone
And I got to let her know just in time before I go
I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
Well, I laughed but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now, I'm crying but deep down inside
Well, I did it to him, now, it's my turn to die
I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
Hold on
I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
I feel the autumn breeze
It steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp
And in its song there is sadness because
There's no you
The lonely autumn trees
How softly they're sighing
For summer is dying they know
That in my heart there's no gladness because
There's no you
The park that we walked in
The garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall
In spring we'll meet again
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture
We knew
And from that day never more will I say
There's no you
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall
In spring we'll meet again
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture
We knew
And from that day never more will I say
There's no you

[Intro: Boyz II Men]
La la la la la la la, oh oh oh
La la la la la, oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Can't believe that I'm never gonna see you you again, after tonight
Gonna lose my lover and my best friend, this can't be right
But it's the way that it has to be
I guess you're not supposed to be with me
Tonight is the end, forever stars tomorrow
I just hope I get past this sorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
It's like my ego's too bruised to be deflated
'Cause the real is that I love you, and I hate it
I knew this day would come, wish it would have waited
Tonight that's the reason why I hesitated
So here we go as I kiss your cheek
You know that's how I always do before I get deep
I hold you tighter than I usually do
'Cause the next person I'll hold will not be you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Got you here right in front of me
And when we're over I know you gonna leave
Yes, it's hard for me to believe
That this could be the last time we do it
Open up your smile and let me be
Drain the spirit that you fill for me
Even though it won't change a thing
'Cause this will be the last time we're making love

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman]
I talk a good game so my boys could hear it
But in my quiet time I really feel it
A sad song and a drink is my company
Seems like loneliness is my destiny
I want this to last forever, don't wanna be done
Don't wanna move on, I don't wanna come
But that's a dream that will soon pass away
Remember tomorrow like it's yesterday

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Got you here right in front of me
And when we're over I know you gonna leave
Yes, it's hard for me to believe
That this could be the last time we do it
Open up your smile and let me be
Drain the spirit that you fill for me
Even though it won't change a thing
'Cause this will be the last time we're making love

[Refrain: Boyz II Men]
Making love, making love
La la la la la, oh oh oh
Making love, making love, making love
La la la la la, oh oh oh

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
I wish there was a way to explain (And believe it)
How can I enjoy this pain when I know you're leaving?
And it's a shame we had to get to the end
To get to the sex that we made when we first began
It's over (You're holding me, I'm touching you)
It's over (You're kissing me, I'm missing you)
Gotta close my eyes 'cause I don't wanna see you go away from me
But don't wanna miss you being here with me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Got you here right in front of me
And when we're over I know you gonna leave
Yes, it's hard for me to believe
That this could be the last time we do it
Open up your smile and let me be
Drain the spirit that you fill for me
Even though it won't change a thing
'Cause this will be the last time we're making love
Got you here right in front of me
And when we're over I know you gonna leave
Yes, it's hard for me to believe
That this could be the last time we do it
Open up your smile and let me be
Drain the spirit that you fill for me
Even though it won't change a thing
'Cause this will be the last time we're making love

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
Your truth is like
A woman brought me
Since I've been here
A woman taught me
Don't worry about
What you can't control
Do your best
And leave the rest alone

[Chorus: The Temptaions & Dennis Edwards]
Keep holding on
Sometimes your back is against the wall
Keep holding on
You gotta keep holding on

[Post-Chorus: Dennis Edwards]
Well well
You got to enjoy each day to survive
'Cause you'll never gamble and like your mind
You gotta celebrate (Celebrate)
Every day you live

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
I still remember
Since I was just a child
My mother held me in her arms
Mama said, that every day

[Chorus: The Temptaions & Dennis Edwards]
You got to keep holding on
Don't let nothin' get around you
Keep holding on
You gotta keep holding on
Son, gotta keep holding on

[Bridge: The Temptations]
Hang on tight
Give your life a fight
You gotta be strong
Keep on pushing on

[Verse 3: Dennis Edwards]
Risk it, every night, there's a mountain
You must climb
Well, sometimes your friends, you got to leave behind
I remember when mama said, said

[Chorus: The Temptaions & Dennis Edwards]
You got to keep holding on
Don't let nothin' get around you
Keep holding on
You gotta keep holding on
Stand up and be a man
Keep holding on

[Outro: Dennis Edwards & The Temptations]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Keep holding on, hang on
Hold on, keep holding on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Keep holding on, hang on
Hold on

[Intro]
Oh yeah, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love with my ex

[Verse 1]
I know you can’t stand me and when you’re angry
Something about that just turns me on
You’re such a diva but I didn’t need ya
But when you’re close, it’s the same old song
I’m all over you, you’re all over me

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate that you loved me so good, so good
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, I’m hooked

[Chorus]
Babe, it's so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
But the feeling’s mutual, it's so mutual
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it
I am still in love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex

[Verse 2]
I see other people just to be evil
It hurts to watch you do the same thing
But from a distance, girl, I was missing
That you would come back like a boomerang and
I’m all over you, you’re all over me

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate that you loved me so good, so good
I can’t live with or without you, I’m hooked, oh, I’m hooked

[Chorus]
Babe, it's so unusual, so unusual (hey)
How you want it, you want it
But the feeling’s mutual, it's so mutual (mutual)
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it
I am still in love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love with my ex (yeah, baby, baby)
I am still in love, love, love, love (c'mon)
Love, love, love, love with my ex (woah)
Love with my ex (oh, yeah, woah)
Love with my ex
Love with my ex

[Bridge]
Even though we broken up, broken up, baby
I still wanna lay you down, lay you down
We may be the perfect match because opposites attract
We don’t wanna leave right now, leave right now
'Cause I’m all over you, you’re all over me

[Chorus]
Babe, it's so unusual, so unusual (usual)
How you want it, you want it (baby)
But the feeling’s mutual, it's so mutual (oh, baby)
And I’m on it, I can’t stand it
I am still in love, love, love, love (in love, love, love, love)
Love, love, love, love with my ex (in love, love, love, love)
I am still in love, love, love, love (with my ex, with my ex)
Love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex

If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you
Leaves would wither and die

The birds in May-time - they'd sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around - hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
The rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me
No winds of winter would blow

I gave you my love - and I was living a dream
But living would seem - in vain if I
(Hating the rain - if I)
(All is in vain if I)
If I ever lost you

[Verse 1]
Some say stories don’t always end perfect
That’s imperfect
Cause I can show you how to make your worst day
Feel like your birthday
The kind of funny only you can discover
If you’re interested

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I do and please join me!

[Chorus]
Get down, get up, get in the out
Hope you ain’t in a rush, we’re gonna be here for a while
Hey hey, jump around and sweat!
Where’s the loudest section?
(Right here!)
Where’s the loudest section?
(Right here!)
Old people you should just leave
'Cause me and the kids gonna scream!

[Verse 2]
It’s all about illumination
That’s what’s based, in option
Don’t you know every single dream is what chasing?
But that is amazing
’Cause it’s okay to be you and to be other
Oh are you listening?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just dance, and don’t you let nobody get in your way
Hey you
I don’t care what they do or what they say
Well, unless I guess the short and the mother
Get them by the wrist
Then make them do what they do in this place to be
And see!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yea, yea, yea, uh
You know what this, you know just what it is
It's Despicable me... 

[repeating]
The most beautiful girl in the world picks my ties out
She eats my candy, she drinks my brandy
The most beautiful girl in the world
The most beautiful star in the world, 'tisn't Garbo
T'sn't Dietrich, but a sweet trick
Who can make me believe it's a beautiful world
Social ? Not a bit! Natural kind of wit
She'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair
The most beautiful house in the world has a mortgage
What do I care ? It's "Good-bye, care"
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl in the world
Lengthy instrumental break
Social ? Not a bit! She's got a natural kind of wit
And I tell ya, she'd shine anywhere, and she hasn't got platinum hair
The most beautiful house in the world, it has a mortgage
What do I care ? It's "Good-bye, care"
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl
The one and only beautiful girl
The one and only beautiful girl in the world
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona Ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
Was about to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip
Met a lot women who could love alright
But nothing like the woman I met this night
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now men don't blame me because I've been around
I don't understand what's she's putting down
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin
But she'll show you how, you just tell her when
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

She's got a peal handled pistol
A knife and a razor too
You can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you
She's dynamite, she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about
Now you can whip it, whop it
Or hang it on the wall
Or throw it out the window
She'll pitch herself a ball
She's dynamite, well she's dynamite
She knows what to do
And she knows what it's all about

[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Wake up in the morning, fold my hands, pray for rain
Got a head full of ideas, that are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way they makes me scrub the floor
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Hands you a nickel, hands you a dime
Asks you with a grin if you're having a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, she talks to the servants about man and God and law
Everybody knows she's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, says she's twenty-four
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's father no more
He puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
Bedroom window is made out of bricks
The national guard hangs 'round his door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's father no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Try my very best to be just like I am
Everybody wants me to be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

[1st Verse]
Ooh-oh-ohhhhhhhh

A-to my left and to my right

For I could use your lovin', that is why I came
And an interest brings her over
But to, ensure she feels the same, order ChamPain

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse]
Her beauty is bubblin over
As we sit and socialize
And accidentally some gets on me
But there is no need, to apoligize
Oh darling, please behave yourself
Or you will be the blame
And it's not complicated
It's rather easy to explain, order ChamPain

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I said baby, baby -- Are you havin fun?
Ah darling, darling -- I think I found the one

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ehhh
Wyclef with Pitbull
The clubs ain't safe tonight

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Mamacita so nice to meet ya
You drunk off that rum
You shouldn't drive tonight
Give me the key to that beemer
She looked at me and laughed
Started shakin her ass
She said her brother just came home
From the jungle

[Post-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Oobie]
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
OH
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh
OH
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
It's a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under
With all these women around me
I got em all colors, shapes and sizes
I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me
Spike Lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'Jungle Fever'
'Cause I like em a little bit darker
Take it from the back to the front, Rosa Park
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference
As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy
We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen
Coffee with no cream, that's like a rock with no fiend
Martin Luther King with no dream, John Lennon couldn't even imaging such a thing
And for those that don't know nothin
Welcome to the jungle, 'Clef tell em somethin (Woo)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Mamacita so nice to meet ya
You drunk off that rum
You shouldn't drive tonight
Give me the key to that beemer
She looked at me and laughed
Started shakin her ass
She said her brother just came home
From the jungle

[Post-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Oobie]
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh oh eh

Preparate mujer que mi lengua es de fuego

And by the end of the night you'll say aii papa

Light skin red bones they blow my mind

Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine
Stop playin with me

Dale papi, dale papi ohhh
And for those that don't know nothin
Welcome to the jungle

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Mamacita so nice to meet ya
You drunk off that rum
You shouldn't drive tonight
Give me the key to that beemer
She looked at me and laughed
Started shakin her ass
She said her brother just came home
From the jungle

It's that jungle fever (Fever)
Watch out, watch out

[Outro: Pitbull]
Now what I'mma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to yall
This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women
What it means is, uh:
To get nasty;
To get freaky;
To do things you've never done before;
To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever
Whites, Black, Latin, Chinese, lo que sea
You know what I'm talkin bout, right Clef?
Haaa
Jungle fever (Fever), jungle fever (Fever)
Jungle fever (Fever), jungle fever
Jungle fever (Fever), jungle fever (Fever)
Jungle fever, jungle fever (Fever)
Jungle fever (Fever), jungle fever (Fever)
Goodbye Angel
I'm going down
But I'm not going 'round the bend
I'm giving out
But I'm not giving in
Love turned to hate
Touch turned to pull
What could I do?
My cup was full
Goodbye angel

Goodbye Angel
I'm giving out
But I'm not giving in
'Cause yesterday is not like today my friend
Love turned to hate
Touch turned to pull
What could I do?
My cup was full
Goodbye angel
Goodbye angel
Just let it go...
Keeping on pulling...
Just let it go...
Goodbye angel
Keeping on pulling...
Just let it go...
In the morning when the moon is at its rest
You will see me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows, play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning
'Tis the morning of my life

In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of the ceiling in my room
Where we'll stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothe's lines
May I be yawning
It is the morning of my life
It is the morning of my life
In the morning, In the morning, In the morning
If you beat up, you butcher, and you bleed a man
You bang up and badger and blood-let a man
And then I come along
On the feet of man
And halfway laugh and cry
About the meat of man
And I do what I can
To bale string and tie
Some ballad truths
Up and cured out
For the feed of man
Folks try to tell me
That it's on God's orders
That you bleed your man
It's on God's good word that you
Bleed your man
On God's plan print
That you dead a man
Or spit and curse and whip your man
I say I'll help you squeeze and fix yourself up a
A new kind of God of some kind
One that tells you
Fertilize and multiply
One that tells you
Outsow and outblow
Outplant and outgrow
Outdo, and outrun, and outclimb, and outspread
Every other tree and bush
And brushy fruits and flower petals
Outfruit them all
For the feed of man
Outstalk and outhunt and outthink
For God's own sweet sake, outthink! Outthink!
Outthink the fruits
Outgrow these animal kinds and shapes of man
It you miss and go down
Your dust will turn up on that long hot job
Once more again
To help in the feeding and the seed of man
And not in the bleeding and the end of man
What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Lovely as ever, I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course, you couldn't know
I haven't changed, I still love you so

Gee, but it's nice to see you again
What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand, adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course, you couldn't know
I haven't changed, I still love you so
My mama done told me, when I was in knee-pants
My mama done told me, "Son
A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye
But when the sweet talkin's done
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing
The blues in the night."

Now the rain's a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin, "Whooee!"

My mama done told me
Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' 'cross the trestle, "Whooee!"
My mama done told me
A-whooee-ah-whooee
Ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back
The blues in the night

The evenin' breeze
Will start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night
And take my word, the mockingbird
Will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong
And he's right

From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds, they might blow
I been in some big towns and I heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know

A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night

Mmm, ooh
My mama was right, there's blues in the night
This is a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself
Yes it's a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself
Yes, you can't get the woman you love and you have to put up with somebody else

Baby, I smile to keep from worryin' and I laugh just to keep from cryin'
Oh I smile to keep from worryin', baby and I laugh just to keep from cryin'

Well, that's to keep the public for knowin' what I got on my mind

Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein
Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein
Well, I hope You'll around by here to mistreat me baby, 'cause my heart it feel no pain

[Verse 1]
It will come to us as a shock
But we're letting it happen
People with their carelessness
Governments with their laisser-faire

[Verse 2]
Are going to lead us
Straight to it, that's for sure
History will only
Repeat itself once more

[Verse 3]
The western world is going
More and more right wing, yearning
For some sort of protection
Too scared to do anything

[Bridge 1]
Not to take the path
That's dragging us down, oh no
Remember it's in our power not
To go down

[Verse 1]
It will come to us as a shock
But we're letting it happen
People with their carelessness
Governments with their laisser-faire

[Bridge 2]
I can feel it more and more
Within ten years we'll have a war
I can feel it more and more
Within ten years we'll have a war

[Verse 1]
It will come to us as a shock
But we're letting it happen
People with their carelessness
Governments with their laisser-faire

[Verse 3]
The western world is going
More and more right wing, yearning
For some sort of protection
Too scared to do anything
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
Took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to seem 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
The big yellow taxi
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi
The big yellow taxi

[Bilal]
Hey, living in the fast lane
Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimping through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone

Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

[Jadakiss]
It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

[Bilal]
Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
Got caught up
And some charges brought up
From some people you shoot up
You and your smile
Hold a strange invitation
Somehow it seems
We've shared our dreams, but where?

Time after time
In a room full of strangers
Out of the blue
Suddenly you are there

Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn

And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh where have you gone?

How long must I stay
In a world of illusion?
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart
Hoping you'll say
With a warm invitation
Where have you been?
Darling come in, into my heart

Wherever I go
You're the glow of temptation
Glancing my way
In the gray of the dawn

And always your eyes
Smile that strange invitation
When you are gone
Where oh where have you gone?

How long must I stay
In a world of illusion?
Be where you are
So near yet so far apart

Hoping you'll say
With a warm invitation
Where have you been?
Darling come in, into my heart
I had a dozen others before I ever met you
And there'll be that many more when you're goin'
You're just one out of many it's easy to forget you
'Cause I just don't care enough to carry on

I haven't broken every heart that chanced to come my way
I haven't cherished any love or begged one girl to stay
So don't think that you only stay away don't phone me
'Cause I just don't have the time to fool with you

Of all the dozen others I knew before I met you
I only said well maybe she's the one
But true love wouldn't cheat me but you did and I let you
You proved untrue so know leave me alone

I thought you surely were the one I wanted for my wife
But I can't stand a cheatin' heart to live with all my life
I've only been your pastime so darlin' for the last time
I just don't have the time to fool with you

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight (Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)
Waiting for tonight
Thank you for this precious day
These gifts you give to me
My heart so full of love for you
Sings praise for all I see
Oh sing for every mother's child
For every childhood tear
Oh sing for all the stars above
The peace beyond all fear

This is for the refugees
The ones without a home
A boat out on the ocean
A city street alone
Are they not some dear mother's child
Are they not you and I
Are we the ones to bear this shame
And they this sacrifice

Or are they just like falling leaves
Who give themselves away
From dust to dust from seed to shear
And to another day
If I could have one wish on Earth
Of all I can conceive
T'would be to see another spring
And bless the falling leaves
Thank you for this precious day
These gifts you give to me
My heart so full of love for you
Sings praise for all I see
Oh sing for every mother's child
For every childhood tear
Oh sing for all the stars above
The peace beyond all fear

[Verse 1]
No demands, just pleasurable sensations
Hand in hand
No far reaching plans
No, no, no, no, hand in hand

[Chorus 1]
Well I keep on trying to understand, daylight bright
How come I keep moving from man to man to man?
Giving my sweet love, tasting sweet love
Real sweet love, woman to man

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's easy, you drift with the empty gladness
Like it all belongs
Sometimes it's low down sadness
Like it's all gone so wrong

[Chorus 2]
When I saw you standing there I said to myself
Here's a place, I could break down and care
I'll give him my sweet love, taste his sweet love
Real sweet love, woman to man

[Verse 3]
I don't like to lie
But I sure can be phony when I get scared
I put my nose up in the air
Stoney, stoney when I get scared

[Chorus 3]
When I saw you standing there, I was scared
I thought oh, I hope he can care
I sure hope I can care, I hope we can really care
And share woman to man

[Outro]
Cause I've been moving man to man to man to man to man
Oh what am I looking for?
Man to man to man to man
A lot of good guys gone through my door
Man to man to man to man
To man to man to man
Man to man to man to man
Woman to man
Come on everybody clap your hands
Now you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song and you won't take long
We gotta do the twist and it goes like this
Come on let's twist again like we did last summer
Yea, let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Yea, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Yeah round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so then
Come on let's twist again like we did last summer
Yea, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Come on let's twist again like we did last summer
Yea, let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Yea, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Yeah round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so then
Come on let's twist again like we did last summer
Yea, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Yo, what's up with all these niggas
On these muthafuckin records talkin all this bullshit
(Man, I don't know about these niggas out here
Them other sucker-ass niggas, them old fake-ass bitches)
I ain't tryin to hear that shit, man
These bitches ain't players, man
(Yeah man
You know these niggas out here been fakin for years, man
I'm glad my nigga Ice comin with that HP shit
That high-powered shit..)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Peace to my street niggas movin that weight
Much love to my comrads who's out in upstate
Mad connections from the bottom to the top of the game
Street fame, I got much that's in touch with my name
Got a overload of guns to unload on a lame nigga trippin
Wake up my posse, interrup the Rémy-sippin
Four in your back and keep bailin
Listen to the HK wailin and your vital signs failin
Everyone that ever met me knows
I work bitches like niggas, pimp niggas like hoes
Command a mack that's immaculate, your girl's naked
You think she ain't been hit, kid yo, you best to check it
For ten years I been connected to the top of this
Hold your breath, kid, I'm never droppin this
Too busy rollin off them fat chrome rims
And niggas who trip get sung hymns
We crash clubs and security shits
Cause they know they got size but they know we keep clips
Crazy muthafuckas lickin shots in doors
Leavin suckers' bodies bleedin over nightclub floors
You don't want none, son, stay gone
Break north when I come and you might live long
Yeah, my face kickin treble, you're just a pebble
You're gettin rocked, yo E, cock the Glock
And let these niggas know, yo, that the west don't play none
Fire shoots out of my strap like a ray-gun
You broke ill and you cold fucked up
Now you're bleedin through your fingers while you're holdin your gut
For real

[ Chorus ]
So get your money how you want to, friend
But when it's time to count the chips only the real will win
(Return of the real) the game of life is only fake and true
But it's all about the dollars when the day is through

[ Hot Dollar ]
(Cause the pimps don't get no bigger
Than these here niggas)

It's the return of the real

(These muthafuckas best to get to recognize
Before I gets to chastizin
Cause see, the shit all ties in
It's just some of that pimp, player, hustler shit
Ice-T been around for a while now
Nigga was gangbangin when gangbangin wasn't even cool, nigga
What you know about that shit?)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I go deep into the street life's anatomy
A nigga take me out - yo, what a upset that'd be
And if I fall I fall on cushions, ???
Hittin niggas up with the Tec and watch the blood gushin
I see your videos, a 100 niggas in it you don't know
Framed in the lens, bought friends
Who really got your back, nigga, check it out
You really possess like zero street clout (think about)
The only place you're safe is in the studio
Yellin in the mic, you'se a bitch, that's right
I take a nigga like you and make him prostitute cute
So what you got a gun, punk, you're scared to shoot
You front hardcore, but I don't feel ya
Kids from my hood'll take your punk ass and peel ya
Let me check my Rolex quick because time's money
Squintin from the Pavet face because it's kinda sunny
Skinnin the top back, flossin the rag and the thing
Feelin the sun, backin off of my pinky ring
Hittin the 'Shaw with my niggas and clown
Lift the ass, hit the switch, raise the front off the ground
But most of the time you can't see a nigga
Deep in the archives parlayin new ways to get my bank bigger

[ Chorus ]

[ Hot Dollar ]
(As I slides up out the do'
Gots to give a special props shout out to that nigga the O.G
Got muthfuckin Red in the house

[Name] and the muthafuckin ringleader of funk, DJ Ace
Hot Dollar's up in this muthafucka
If you didn't know
Count your muthafuckin blessings and handcuff your hoe
You know what I'm sayin?
It's all good for my hood
Comp-town in the muthafuckin house
Nigga don't know well I tell ya like this
West Hollywood Hills
That's the deal, fool
You know I know the rules..)
I've had this feeling before but never like this
Love had me reeling before but never like this
Who ever dreamed this could happen
To someone supposed to be smart
I must have really been napping
To let you walked off with my heart

My dreams, and I had quite a few, were never like this
This is too good to be true, but so was that kiss
I know by the way my heart leaps
That this time I'm playing for keeps

Yes, I've had this feeling before
Darling, but never like this
Betty the taxi driver: First we see the sights, then let's come to my place

Frank: Oh no, then we will have to go looking for Davey's girl

"So, you're going to leave the old home, Jim
Today you're going away
So, you're going among the city folks to dwell"
So spoke a kind old mother
To her boy one summer day
"If your mind's made up that way, I wish you well
The old home will be lonesome
We'll miss you when you go
The birds won't sing so sweet when you're not nigh
But if you get in trouble, Jim
Just write and let us know"
She spoke these words and then she said goodbye

If sickness overtakes you
Or old companions shake you
As through this world you wander all alone
When friends you haven't any
In your pocket not a penny
There's a mother always awaiting you at home

Ten years later to this village
Came a stranger no one knew
His steps were halt and ragged clothes he wore
The little children laughed at him
As down the lane he trod
At last he stopped before a cottage door
He gently knocked, no sound he heard
He thought, "Can she be dead?"
But then he heard a voice well known to him
Was his mother's voice, but her hair had silvered
By the touch of time
And she said, "Thank God, they've sent me home my Jim"
If sickness overtakes you
Or old companions shake you
As through this world you wander all alone
When friends you haven't any
What a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning the great speckled bird
And to know that my name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching but really she makes no mistakes
I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Saviour to look
And when he come up descending from heaven on a cloud like he said in his word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of the great speckled bird
Someone told someone and someone told you
But they really wouldn't hurt you, not much
But since everyone tells the story
With his own little personal touch

Do nothing till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seams
Of anyone's dreams is over my head

Do nothing till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words
Of others you've heard, I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I've been untrue?
When we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memories
And other arms may hold a thrill, yes yes yes
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill, hold that thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will
So please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body
Your body, na, na, na, na
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body
Your body, na na na na

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights down low
I'm ready to break it off
Since computer love
Been wantin' to set it off
Like a hotel room
I'm checkin' into you
I'm diggin' like a shovel
All the things you do
Take a leap over the broom
That's how you're makin' me feel
Come on in this room
And let's keep it real and go

[Chorus]
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me (Singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na
Half on a baby (All I need)
All I need is your body next to me (I'm singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body
Your body, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Now tell me what the deal is
Are you ready to bump?
It's gonna take a lifetime
To give you all of this love
So baby, open up
And get ready to receive
A miracle of love
Gettin' down with me
Like a baseball field
Wanna hit a home run
Me and you get together, babe
And raise a little one

[Chorus]
Half on a baby (All I need)
All I need is your body next to me (Singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body
Your body, na, na, na, na (Half)
Half on a baby (All I need)
All I need is your body next to me (Singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body (Your)
Your body, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
Set it off in a six
Baby, that'll be cool
Take a trip downtown
Between me and you
Trippin' on Perignon
Conversation like what
Not afraid to go there
Once you open up
After nine to five
You deserve some twelve
Makin' future plans
To be where I dwell

[Chorus]
Half on a baby (All I need, yeah)
All I need is your body next to me (I'm singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body (Oh, oh, oh)
Your body, na, na, na, na (Half)
Half on a baby (Sing it now, sing it now)
All I need is your body next to me (Singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body (Oh yeah)
Your body, na, na, na, na

[Bridge]
(From my toes up)
From my toes up
(To my knee caps)
To my knee caps
To waist line
(Now slowly)
Now slowly, lady
Can we go half on a baby?
(From my toes up)
From my toes up
(On up to my)
To my knee caps
To waist line
(Now slowly)
Now slowly lady
Can we go half on a baby?
(Half)

[Chorus]
Half on a baby (On a cute little baby boy)
All I need is your body next to me (I'm singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body (Yeah)
Your body, na, na, na, na (Can we go half?)
Half on a baby (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
All I need is your body next to me (I'm singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body
Your body, na, na, na, na (Can we go half?)
Half on a baby (On a sweet little baby girl)
All I need is your body next to me (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body
Your body, na, na, na, na
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body (Sometimes)
Your body, na, na, na, na (You get lonely)

[Intro]
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide

[Verse 1]
The foxes have a hole, the birdies have a nest
The Son of God, He don't know where to lay His sweet head

[Chorus]
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide

[Verse 2]
There was room at the inn
For the merchants that day
But Joseph and Mary had no place to stay

[Chorus]
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide

[Verse 3]
Then a star in the heavens
The message did bring
The tiny Babe in swaddling cloth was Jesus the King

[Chorus]
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide

[Outro]
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Jehovah, Hallelujah, the Lord will provide
Baby, here I stand before you with my heart in my hand
I want you greet it mama hopin' that you'll understand
Oh baby, mama please don't dog me around
Well, I'd rather love you baby, than anyone else I know in town

Well, because you're so nice and lovely
And you have such pleasant ways
If you take to your home I'll be there the rest of my days
That's the truth mama
Yes, you know I wouldn't lie
Well, if I don't love you baby
I swear I hope I die

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be

Well now, this is my confession mama
And I'm thrilled by all your charms
It seems that I'm in heaven when you hold me in your arms
Now baby, you can have me for yourself
Well now, you was meant for me baby
And I don't want nobody else
Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be

[Interlude]
Enter into my room
Dim the lights and hop right into bed with me
I will satisfy your needs going half on a baby
Are you down with me?
Dearly be, are you down with me?
Half on a baby, are you down with me?
Dearly be, are you down with me?
Half on a baby, are you down?
Going half, going half, going half
Going half, going half, on a baby
Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again

Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you

Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway

It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles

I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk
Does it seem like he's not even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love
I have inside, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you

[Incomprehensible]
What I need, my love
All that I have to give to you

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you
Ohh, all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

And up, get ya self in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from Gittero what?

Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
Ass in, ain't no askin', it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the call of the streets

I was born in '49
Family of four
Father had his own band
Was just after the war

My brother and I had a radio
And every night we'd share
Waves from Luxembourg
Came though the air

Days were full of music
And nights were just the same
And though the songs are different now
Some things never change...

Can't explain the way I feel
Why, event to this day
I still love the sound of that red guitar
It takes my breath away
And goes straight...
To my heart
Straight to my heart
Straight to my heart

[Verse 1]
I heard you speak one time in an interview
Was the sweetest lil' thing I ever heard
(Sweetest lil' thing I ever heard)
My eyes going down on you like a parachute (Down)
I wanna creep with you and that's my word
(Creep with you and that's my word)
Now, I've been knowin' mami for a while now
(A long time)
And God know she's been good to me
(Real good, real good) Yes, she has
But uh, I can't help it when I see you smile
(I just can't help it)
Something's tellin' me what I do to her
You would do to me, so what do I do?

[Chorus]
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
(When I do)
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
(What do I do?)
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
Help me y'all

[Verse 2]
Now, Proverbs 18 verse 22 says (What it say, man?)
He that findeth a wife finds a good thing
(That's what the Bible says)
Lyin' by her side thinkin' of you
I gots to get up, go to the toilet
Wash my face, and clear my head
I gotta take you to a Broadway show (Broadway show)
But I don't wanna go by myself
I'm like a kid with two ice creams, baby
And I don't want either one to melt
'Cause ever since I heard you speak in that interview
It is an awful feelin' if I hurt her
Then some days you're gonna hurt me too

[Chorus]
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do? (Do)
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
(Foolin' around with you)
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
(What will I lose?)

[Bridge]
I heard that what goes around (What goes around)
Comes back around (Comes back around)
And you're gonna reap what you sow (Sow)
Everyone knows...but me

[Chorus]
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do? (What do I do?)
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
(Foolin' around with you)
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
Somebody tell me, what will I gain, what will I lose?
(What will I lose?)
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
(I don't wanna lose you, baby)
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
(No, no, no...)
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
Somebody tell me what will I gain, what will I lose?
(What will I gain? What will I lose?)
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea
With the granite cliff
(Big Sur mount)
As a referee
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns
A mother deer with their newborn fawns
All under Big Sur skies
(Big Sur mount)
That's where I belong

Big Sur I've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers
(Big Sur mount)
And live in canyons covered in springtime green
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And with my old guitar
(Big Sur mount)
I'll make up songs to sing
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide
(Big Sur mount)
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water
(Big Sur mount)
And so while stars shine brightly from up above
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log
(Big Sur mount)

From time to time I must go away
But thoughts of Big Sur won't let me stay
Away from Big Sur
Oh Big Sur

[Verse 1]
The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

[Verse 2]
The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversations with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

[Chorus 1]
No more pain
No, no more strain
Now I'm sane
But I'd rather be punch drunk

[Verse 3]
The flying fur of cat and cur
The fine mismatching of a him and her
I've learned my lesson but I wish I were
In love again

[Verse 4]
The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words I love you 'til the day I die
The self-deception that believes that lie
I wish I were in love again

[Verse 5]
When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

[Chorus 2]
No more care
No more despair
Now I'm all there
But I'd rather be punch drunk

[Verse 6]
Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again
In love again
The season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living
The Christmas time when I was young
The magic and the wonder
But colours dull and candles dim
And dark my standing under

O little angel, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning
A Saviour King was born that day
A baby just like you

And as the Magi came with gifts
I come with my gift too
That peace on Earth fills up your time
That brotherhood surrounds you
That you may know the warmth of love
And wrap it all around you
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas, little Angela
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, little Angela
Merry Christmas, everyone
The old folks don't talk much
They talk so slowly when they do
They are rich they are poor
Their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of time
Of old photographs
And an old fashioned song
Though you may live in town
You live so far away
When you've lived too long

Have they laughed too much
Do their dry voices crack
Talking of things gone by
Have they cried too much
A tear or two still always seems
To cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock oh so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old folks dream no more
Their books have gone to sleep
The piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead
And no more do they sing on a sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more
Their world become to small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out a window
Or else sit it a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out
Arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning chill
Its to have a good cry
To say their last goodbye
To one who's older still
And then they go home
To the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock so so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you
The old folks never die
They just put down their heads
And go to sleep one day
They will hold each others hands
Like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway
And the other will remain
Just sitting in a room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now
The song has died away
And echo's all around

You'll see them as they walk
Through the sun filled parks
Where children run and play
It hurst to much to smile
It hurts so much
But life goes on for still another day
As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
Tick tock oh so slow
It says yes it says no
It says I wait for you

The old old silver clock
Thats hanging on the wall
That waits for us all
Take my hand and run with me out of the past called yesterday
And walk with me into the future on to tomorrow
Yesterday my sweetful life rolled again back no matter what
There is nothing left but memories that bring sorrows
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

No more cryin' and memories find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone but tomorrow is forever

I care no for yesterday, I love you as you are today
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind of love that won't hurt you forever
Yesterday is over. tomorrow is forever

[Verse 1: Shawn]
I know you've been goin' through some things
The pain you hold inside is written on your face
I know you're 'bout tired of the rain
Well baby so am I but I know things can change
Well you can die, you can sigh, you can cry
'Til you're midnight blue
But that's not you, no no
'Cause I know you're stronger and...
It's apparent to me
So do you

[Chorus]
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous (I know)
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way, my love
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous (I know)
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way

[Verse 2: Wanya]
I know it's been heavy on your mind
Baby give him up he's not worth your time
Where is it that says you need a guy
Well you don't need his love to justify your life
So he can go, let him go, make him go
You should want him to
So can you?
I know that you're stronger
It's getting clearer to me
So do you?

[Chorus]
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way

[Bridge: Nathan & (Wanya)]
So don't let your defenses down
I know somehow you'll work things out
Don't make your heart on no one else
You should just (believe in yourself, yourself)

[Chorus]
If you just hold on
I swear that everything will be okay
I know that you're nervous
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way
If you just hold on (Hold on)
I swear that everything will be okay (hold on)
I know that you're nervous
Baby give it some time
Things will go your way
(I know I know, things will go your way)
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake (really?)
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Say, you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And he's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

I want to see the blessed face
Of Him who died for me
Sacrificed his life for my liberty
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want, I want to see the blessed face
Of Him who died for me
Sacrificed his life for my liberty

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams & (Choir)]
He saved my life

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And He is my hope
(For my tomorrow)
Don't you know that he is?

How could he love me so?
I think, I'll never know why He

And now I know, know, know
(I could never repay Him)
But all of my life
(I could never repay Him)

[Outro: Yolanda Adams & (Choir)]
How could He love me so?
I'm sure, I will never know why He

Hallelujah

Glory to ya

Lord, I truly adore you
(Sacrificed His life)
I'll place no one before you

Even though my friends may forsake me
(Sacrificed His life)
Lord, I know You're the one that set me free
(Sacrificed His life)
Hallelujah
(Sacrificed His love)
Lord, I truly love you
(Sacrificed His life)
Oh yeah
(For my liberty)
So you lost your trust
And you never should have
And you never should have
But don't break your back
If you ever hear this
But don't answer that
'Cause in a bullet proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
And I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
So they came for you
They came snapping at your heels
They come snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever hear this
But don't answer that
'Cause in a bullet proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
And I'll see you soon
And in a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
You lost your trust
And oh, you lost your trust
No, don't lose your trust
And oh, you lost your trust
As I sat down one evening within a small cafe
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say:

"I see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum
'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb

My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;
If you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay

He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide;
He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside

My lover came to see me upon one freezing day;
He held me in his fond embrace which broke three vertebrae

He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw

I saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow
Going gaily homeward at forty-eight below
The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;
At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest

It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;
At a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love

They tried in vain to thaw him, and would you believe me, sir
They made him into axeblades, to chop the Douglas fir

And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb."

[Verse 1]
There are those who can live
With the things they don't believe in
They are giving up their lives
For something that is less than it can be
Some have longed for a home
In a place of inspiration
Some will fill the emptiness inside
By giving it all to the things that they believe
They believe

[Chorus]
Maybe it's just the dream in me
Maybe it's just my style
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found
But iven the possibility
Of living up to the dream in me
You know that I'll be reaching for higher ground

[Verse 2]
I will stand on my own
I will live up to this vision
I will trust in what I feel
I'll follow my heart until it brings me home
Brings me home

[Chorus]
Maybe it's just the dream in me
Maybe it's just my style
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found
But iven the possibility
Of living up to the dream in me
You know that I'll be reaching for higher ground

[Bridge]
Keep me through the night
Lead me to the light
Teach me the magic of wonder
Give me the spirit to fly

[Chorus]
Maybe it's just the dream in me
Maybe it's just my style
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found
But iven the possibility
Of living up to the dream in me
You know that I'll be reaching for higher ground
Maybe it's just the dream in me
Maybe it's just my style
Maybe it's just the freedom that I've found
But iven the possibility
Of living up to the dream in me
You know that I'll be reaching for higher ground
When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughin', when you're laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that cryin', be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you

When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world, it smiles with you
When you're laughin', oh babe, when you're laughin'
The sun would-a come shining through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that sighin', come on and be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby
The whole world smiles with you
Österåker, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped askin' why

Österåker, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me thru an' thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman why can't you understand

Österåker, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you may my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

Österåker, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good

Österåker, you've been livin' hell to me
Got a hard working woman, works hard all day long
Got a hard working woman, she works hard all the time
She's a hard working woman, I call her that gal of mine

Well, I went uptown and bought her clothes
My baby got my money, put me outdoors
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman, works hard all the time

Well, I bought her clothes and I bought her hair
My baby's gone, gone away somewhere
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman, works hard all the time

She works hard all day, doing the best she can
When you come home at night, she's got another man
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman, works hard all the time
Well, I give her my dough to spend on the line
When it comes to loving, she's the gal of mine
She's a hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Hard working woman
Good loving mama, and I love her all the time
Will this be moon love, nothing but moon love
Will you be gone when the dawn comes stealing through?
Are these just moon dreams, grand while the moon beams?
But when the moon fades away, will my dreams come true?
Much as I love you, don't let me love you
If I must pay for your kiss with lonely tears, say it's not moon love
Tell me it's true, say you'll be mine when the moon disappears

[Intro]
I've been

[Verse 1]
All I need is a place to be and a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts and find a way to show
What I feel and if this is real, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Verse 2]
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong
Or if it's just about me all along
All I need is time to search within my soul
So I can share a deeper part of me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Bridge]
Baby, what's meant to be (What's meant to be)
Will surely be (Will surely be, baby)
(If you love me, baby, you would understand)
But I can't give you anything (Can't give you anything)
I don't have myself to give (Don't have myself to give)
And it's killing me inside

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Part 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
Now what remains? The wind and rain

And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the waters all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes

Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the rivers all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes

(Winter gray and falling rain)
(We'll see summer come again)
(Darkness falls and seasons change)
Gonna happen every time
(Same old friends the wind and rain)
We'll see summer by and by
Summers fade and roses die
(You'll see summer come again)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky

[Part 2: "LET IT GROW"]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear!
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again!

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield!

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"
Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain the best upper-sets do it
Lithuanians and Lats do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in Old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges they say do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams against their wish do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks ‘em I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter bring me shad roe

In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Mosquitoes heaven forbid do it
So does every katydid do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

The most refined ladybugs do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
What's the use of moth balls?

Locusts in trees do it, bees do it
Even over-educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Let's do it, let's fall in love
Let's do it, let's fall in love
I knew it from the start you would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me round your little bitty finger
With your magic smile

You kept me hangin' on a lover's cross awhile
You put your spell on me, took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl, I'm gonna miss you, baby

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you
Like a honey bee, you took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale, you were so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal

When you had a taste of paradise
Back on Earth can feel as cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you
We've been friends forever
Lookin' for the same thing
And true love can be hard to find
Maybe we've been lookin' in all the wrong places
Cause we keep coming back here every time

Talking to each other
Comparing our heartaches
Confessing all the ways we long to be satisfied

Maybe there's something goin' on here
Maybe there's something here for you and me

And we should be making love
Instead of wasting time with someone else
We should be making love
Instead going home all by ourselves

Oh now I've told you
I want to be your lover
Let my hands discover you in a different way
I don't want no other
Do you feel it too?
Every time we get together
Telling our stories
Comparing our heartaches
Confessing the ways we long to be satisfied

And we should be making love
Instead of wasting time with someone else
We should be making love
Instead going home all by ourselves

Holding each other
Living in the future
Counting the ways we long to be satisfied

I know there's something goin' on here
You know it's so obvious to see

And we should be making love
Instead of wasting time with someone else
We should be making love
Instead going home all by ourselves

[Verse 1]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real...

[Bridge - Rap]
They call me the ego of rhyme, Young Soldier Of Time
From the past 2 the future while my world be spinnin'
200 and one, another century arrived
Thought I wasn't gonna make 2 see the year '95

Tryin' 2 check me, but they can't f--k with the Y.S.O.T
Yeah, and I'm out

[Verse 3]
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel
Now now, my darling
Can I have a little talk with you
Oh now now now now, darling
Can I have a little talk with you
You know I don't think it will be long
Before our love is through

Yes, tell me, darling
Am I right or am I wrong
Oh tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I right or am I wrong
I just wanna know, baby
When are you coming home

Hey, listen to me, baby
While I hold your hand
Hey, listen to me, baby
While I hold your hand
Don't want nothing
I just wanna be your man
When darkness falls
I'm so all alone
Yes, yes, my darling
I'm so all alone
And you know I wouldn't be, baby
If I knew when you were coming home

Hey, listen to me, baby
Honey, while I hold your hand
Hey, I want you to listen to me, baby
Honey, while I hold your hand
I don't want nothing
I just wanna be your man

Your smiles are my happiness
Your sorrow are my tears
Oh your smiles are my happiness
And your sorrow are my tears
If you just whisper love to me, baby
You know it'll live on through the years
Yes, it will

Everybody makes mistakes
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
I try to make you late
But you fight me out like a fighter does
You try making me wait
But it feels alright as long as something's happening

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

[Verse 1]
We need volunteers
We're the people of the party, here
Something's happening
Same old feeling is back again

[Chorus]
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me
Take a willing soul to the next phase
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me
Take my soul to the next phase

[Verse 2]
See you standing tall
We're here jamming, wall to wall
Feel the spirit happening
Thank you for letting me do it all again

[Chorus]
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me
Take a willing soul to the next phase
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me
Take my soul to the next phase

[Verse 3]
Feel the music coming down
Happy feelings all around

[Chorus]
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me
Take a willing soul to the next phase
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me
Take us all to the next phase

[Bridge]
Come on, get up with the feeling, yeah
Come on, yeah, help me with the feeling
Come on, yeah, help me with the feeling
Come on, yeah, I think I got the feeling
Whoo

[Verse 4]
We need volunteers
We're the people of the party, here
Something's happening
I wanna thank you for letting me do it all again

[Chorus]
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me, take a willing soul to the next phase
Take me to the next phase, baby
Take me, take us all to the next phase

[Outro]
Everybody say...
Yeah
Everybody say...
I like it, yeah
Come on, yeah
Help me with the feeling, yeah
Come on, yeah
Help me get the feeling
I got it

Y'all keep on jammin'
There was a time
When I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dyin' heart made it hard to breathe

Would sit in my room
Because I didn't want to go out
And see you walkin' by
One look and I'd break down and cry

Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe but

I'm doin' just fine, gettin' along very well
Without you in my life, I don't need you in my life
I'm doin' just fine, time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

You were my earth
My number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me, I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather
And told me that you had to journey
On a kiss in the wind and your love was gone

Now you say you never meant to play your games
Girl, you don't know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart
You no longer have my heart

I'm doin' just fine, gettin' along very well
Without you in my life, I don't need you in my life
I'm doin' just fine, time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind

When you said goodbye I felt so all alone
There were time at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak
To make it on my own

Baby, after all the misery and pain
You put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you at all

I'm doin' just fine, gettin' along very well
Without you in my life, I don't need you in my life
I'm doin' just fine, time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
See baby, when you walked away
You didn't think it would end up this way
But I knew you'd come around someday
Just as sure as my name is Wanya

[Verse 1]
It makes a long time man feel bad
It makes a long time man feel bad
He can't get no letter
He can't hear from home
That makes a long time man feel bad

[Verse 2]
My baby sister keeps writin' "Come on home"
My baby sister keeps writin' "Come on home"
And my tears run down 'cause my time's so long
It makes a long time man feel bad

[Verse 3]
Well, surely my mother must be gone
Surely, surely my mother must be gone
Well surely my mother must be gone, oh Lord
That makes a long time man feel bad

[Verse 4]
There ain't no doctor, no doctor in all this land
There ain't no doctor, no doctor in all this land
Ain't no doctor can cure the fever of a convict man
That makes a long time man feel bad

[Outro]
It makes a long time man feel bad
It makes a long time man feel bad
He can't get no letter
He can't even hear from home
That makes a long time man feel bad
Let's let the world just take its shape
I'll let my face be your blank page
Let my dreams be your escape
You'll just let me come home

Oh, I'm a panic I can't explain
I'm prepared to make all of your mistakes
Stricken like a flower being bent by the rain
Won't you let me come home

Let me come home
Let me come home
Can't you see my heart is boiling
Can't you see my heart is boiling

Life is short, but the lines are long
Everybody dies, but we're not gone
Won't you please help me sing along
Let me come home

Birds all sing and no one knows why
They were never asked, and it makes me cry
Hello always sounds like goodbye
Please, let me come home
Let me come home
Let me come home
Can't you see my heart is boiling
Can't you see my heart is boiling

Hi we're the Beach Boys
And we'd like to thank all the guys at KDWB
For being so cool
And for playing all the Beach Boys records
Especially our latest
Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity

Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me

A peaceful place or so it looks from space

[A] closer look reveals the human race

Full of hope, full of grace is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down
(ashes, ashes all fall down)

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins, and again the bloodwind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise

[But] the darkness never goes from some mens eyes (oh no)
It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
It's taking turf, dividing up meat

Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me

Flashblade in ghetto night
Rudies looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones

And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down
(ashes, ashes all fall down)

Commissars and pin-striped bosses roll the dice
Any way they fall, guess who gets to pay the price

Money green, the proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
While the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down
(ashes, ashes all fall down)
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink
History's page will be neatly carved in stone
The future's here – we are it – we are on our own
(on our own, on our own! On our own!)

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame

We will leave this place an empty stone
Oh that shinning ball
We can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
While the politicians are throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down
(ashes, ashes all fall down)

Shooting powders back and forth
Singing black goes south while white comes north
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing "I got mine and you got yours"

And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical, he rant and rage
Singing "someone got to turn the page!"
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing "just leave well enough alone!"
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear were on our own
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down
(ashes, ashes all fall down)

Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities

Ashes, ashes all fall down
(ashes, ashes all fall down)
Where do you go when your conscience takes over
Do you crawl to your corner and cry
Did you imagine, that no one would notice
Just a secret to take when you die

All the world is watching you, every tongue is screaming
Sinner

How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep
Making darkness a place you despise
Where is the god, that once was your strength
Are you sure he was there from the start

All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide
Every tongue is screaming, only satan hears your cries

When you sin cardinal sin
You make your bed and on it you must lie, you must lie
And your futures looking grim
But did you ever give a damn about the child, he's running wild
When you sin cardinal sin
Don't expect the world will treat you well
Do you think that god will forgive all your sins now
Will you need to sell your soul
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin
Laugh in your face, sin cardinal sin
We point the finger, laugh in your face
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race

Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin
You walked in
Around
Through a door
Got inside
Sweet Angel
A bit too hastily

I asked you
Wait for me
I'm slow to
Turn around
And I wasn't ready

Don't shatter
Love is so precious
Hold together
You are on the path
To your aim

Don't pull the roots
They are nourishing
So are the fruits
As we gasp
The leaves' oxygen
You walked in
Around
Through a door
Got inside

I asked you
Wait for me
I'm slow to
Turn inside
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
Yeah, oh, pa-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra
Oh, oh, oh, hey
Used to work every day
I guess I never really thought about it (Uh)
Around the world playing the field but you were chill
As I reflect it seems you just allowed it
All the Facebook photographs of ladies adorin' me
Meanwhile, you were sitting home alone (Oh)
(Take it, Nate)

My world's falling apart
Caught me off guard, because we never ever talked about it
Now heartbreak is the tune, a million words, a million tears just Can’t do nothing about it
It’s my bad, I don’t want you to apologize for what you feel
Girl, you were looking for the love you needed

Images keep on swirling in my mind, so every day I gotta pray about it
(Not like you)
Truth is I don’t question your character just so hurt and really mad about it
(Not like you)
Baby, you were selfless while I was selfishly busy doing me
(Not like you)
I got too busy almost losing you
(I know it’s not like you)
I knew I had you so I took your love for granted like I really didn’t care about it
(Not like you)
Never realized what you got until it's gone now all I do is sit and think about it
(Not like you)
Cast the hurt, and the shame, and my ego’s blame in the sea of forgetfulness
(Not like you)
Please forgive me I’ve been such a fool
(I guess it’s not like you)

I almost lost you, now I know for sure
We have a love that’s worth fighting for
Even though it hurts, I’m gonna hold on tighter, I won’t let you go
When you find the one you love has been cheating
And saying sorry is a state of being
I guess I gotta learn my lesson from painful memories

Images keep on swirling in my mind so every day I gotta pray about it
(Not like you)
Truth is, I don’t question your character. I'm just so hurt and really mad about it
(Not like you)
Baby, you were selfless while I was selfishly doing me
(Not like you)
I got too busy almost losing you
(I know it’s not like you)

I knew I had you, so I took your love for granted like I really didn’t care about it
(Not like you)
Never realized what you got, until it's gone, all I do is sit and think about it
(Not like you)
Cast the hurt, and the shame, and my ego’s blame in the sea of forgetfulness
(Not like you)
(Please forgive me, I’ve been such a fool)
Such a fool, such a fool
(But this is not like you)
Not like you, oh
Baby (Not like you)
Baby, please (Not like you)
Please, don’t leave me baby, no (Not like you)
I got too busy almost losing you (Forgive me, forgive me)
I know it’s not like you, oh (Not like you)
It’s just so not like you baby, I don’t know (Not like you)
Cast the hurt, and the shame, and my ego’s blame in the sea of forgetfulness (Not like you)
Forgive me I’ve been such a fool
But this is not like you
What is man that you are mindful of him, Lord
You made the stars you made the sun
And all the worlds that came to be at your command
What is man? What has he done?

Then you crown him with glory and with honor
Give him dominion over land and sea and air
And store up an inheritance in heaven
O what is man that you would care

What is man that you would let him live at all
To shed the blood of his own kind
And ever fail to even follow where you call
What is man? Why do you mind?

Yet you crown me with glory and with honor
Give me dominion over land and sea and air
And store up my inheritance in heaven
O what is man, that you care?
What is man, Lord, that you would care?
It's gonna be a party y'all
Keith Murray roacks wide and universal and most come

Rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect
At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stacks the stuff and spread love like it's used
The lyrical genius and R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof, we sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumping, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody knew somebody who was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year, yeah ay yo, come on

Nuggets on the wrist, it's just the shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Maybe it's all good so there's tonight
All we want is a party a reason to celebrate
Now that we got the money we dance the night away
Nothing but the hands up

Hands in the air

Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Oh, oh, oh
No, no, no
I must be wrong, baby, yeah
But I don't believe that he's the one
But if you insist
I must be wrong, I must be wrong
I have to leave
And when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
That's right
Beware, my love
He'll bowl you over
Beware, my love
Before you're much older
He'll sweep you up under his carpet
You'd be in luck if you could stop it
Come on, now
Well, he'll wear you out
And in a miniute
You'll hear a shout
And then you'll be in it
So, so beware my love
'cause he'll take you under
Beware, my love
The sound of his thunder;
Can't say (I've) found out
I tell you to
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
Beware, my love
You're gonna say something to the people?
A prayer for you

Just a simple thought of you means everything
To my life you give meaning that you're the best thing
So precious like it for life

That everything intended for you, you'll receive
And I believe he'll guide ya
Right out of my prayer

I'll do my best to be there for you everyday
To be what my father wished he was to me
Baby I got you

(I ain't going no where, even when i get on your nerves
'Cause I'm your daddy)
My prayer for you
Son I pray for you
I was born a travellin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town its what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years since '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left for me
I'm a travellin' man
Travellin' Man -- that's what I am
Travellin' Man
Travellin' Man
That's what I am

Travellin' man -- that's what I am
No one puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice
That's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool and fall in love with a travellin' man
I'm a travellin' man
Travellin' Man -- that's what I am
Travellin' Man
Travellin' Man
That's what I am
Travellin' man -- that's what I am
But at least I'm free
Travellin' man
Oh that's what I am

Travellin man -- that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have lasted

Travellin' Man -- that's what I am
Travellin' Man
Travellin' Man

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
So much anticipation
For this conversation
Such a long time
Like a meeting of two nations
This special occasion
Got us both tongue tied

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me just say that I've respected you
From a distance
I been watching you, sho' been watching you
In the time it took the others to say your name
We became magnificent

[Chorus]
What I'm about to say will astound you
But I can only say it when no one's around you
Magnificent, oh oh
Magnificent
When it pounds you
Magnificent, oh oh
The voice that you hear is the alchemy of your mind

[Verse 2]
The two of us like stardust
We go back, yeah we must
To the dawning of all time
To the nuclear reaction
The only present satisfaction
The sweet and sticky kind

[Pre-Chorus]
Regardless of what they say to you
The moment you hear me speak they're through
Like paradise I'm so nice
I never lose my effect on you

[Chorus]
What I'm about to say will astound you
But I can only say it when no one's around you
Magnificent, oh oh
Magnificent
When it pounds you
Magnificent, oh oh
The voice that you hear is the alchemy of your mind

[Break]
The voice that you hear is the alchemy of your mind
Counting backwards, a thousand to one
Everything we do is so much fun
To our time before time began
Before I was a woman, before you were a man
Before sex and race ever mattered
Tell me now do you understand?

[Chorus]
What I'm about to say will astound you
But I can only say it when no one's around you
What I'm about to say will astound you
But I can only say it when no one's around you
Magnificent, oh oh
Magnificent
When it pounds you
Magnificent, oh oh
The voice that you hear is the alchemy of your mind
Magnificent
Magnificent, oh oh
Magnificent
Magnificent, oh oh
The voice that you hear is the alchemy of your mind
(Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound
Angel Lady come just in time)

She came on like a summer breeze
And oh she talked ooh she teased me
Right up to her door and then
Then she popped it to me
Won't you come on in
I wanna hold you I wanna squeeze you
I will get down on my knees
And do anything you want me to
And just then I turned to my devil and said
I say you.. you and I are through

Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound
The devil said we've travelled too long
And anyone who's ever seen has seen me
You know you can't trust no woman
And I think this ones teasing
But boy you've got it coming
But I'll keep her around
Cos you're pulling me down
And when she looks at me that special way
I forget about yesterday
And then the devil grabbed ahold of me
And he let me know that it ain't gonna be that easy

Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound

And then she cocked her head to the side
A question rose up in her eyes
And it said why are we both here all alone
Can I help you can I carry that stone
Her skin was so fine as I touched
And from just an inch away
I couldn't help but say
That I knew what she saw
And I knew what she knew
And I turned to my devil and swore we were through
Angel Lady come just in time
Chased that devil from my broken mind
Got back my soul from the lost and found
Kicked that trip that had me chained and bound
All through the year
We've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See winter time bringing
The happies season of all

Chestnuts roasting on a open fire
Jackfrost nippin' at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey, and some mistleoe
Will help o make he season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times
Many ways
Merry Christmas, to you

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times
Many ways
Merry Christmas, to you

[Verse 1]
I know something you don't know
I want you to listen to the tale
I know a reasonable woman
Handsome and witty, yet a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
An equal mixture of good humour

[Chorus]
And sweet, sweet memories (Ah, sweet memories)
Sweet, sweet memories
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet, memories
She's got sweet, sweet memories
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories

[Verse 2]
Has she got any faults then?
Yes, she has one I must admit
When all the world tries to praise her
She refuses to hear it

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
An equal mixture of good humour

[Chorus]
And sweet, sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Yeah, we got sweet, sweet memories
Sweet, memories
Sweet, sweet memories
She's got sweet, sweet memories
Yeah, sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
She's got the right amount of passion
She isn't into rumour
Not too serious or too dumb
An equal mixture of good humour

[Chorus]
And sweet, sweet memories
Sensible soft and melancholy
Sweet, sweet memories
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories

[Outro]
She's got sweet, sweet memories
Sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Oh, memory, memories
Sweetest thing you ever saw
Hey yeah, sweet, sweet memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Taking me back
Taking me back
Taking me back

[Verse 1]
A night flight out to D.C
Phone rings with the news
My God, I'm so excited
It's time to look for baby shoes, yes
Everyone says I'm glowing
From a heart filled with joy
Too soon to be showing
Is it a girl is it a boy?

[Chorus]
Found out you're my darling girl
Don't you know you change my world?
You're my little doll so sweet
You nearly knock me off my feet
You're my little darling child
Seeing you makes me smile
God bless the day He sent my little angel to me, mmm

[Verse 2]
Here's my favorite picture
When you were ten minutes old
And we were right there with ya
To wrap you up and keep you warm
And now that you're a little older, older
I see your personality
Every time that I hold ya
I'm sure you'll know much more than me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my little darling girl
Don't you know you change my world?
You're my little doll so sweet
You nearly knock me off my feet
You're my little darling child
Seeing you makes me smile
God bless the day He sent my little angel to me

[Bridge]
And you were perfect from the first day
They getting tired of hearing me say
I'm not ashamed to stand up and tell the world
That you're my my my baby girl oh
Ladadadadada
Ladada dada dada dada

[Verse 3]
Hanging tight with your mama
Traveling 'round the globe
Telling folks about Jesus
And how He came to save their souls
Obviously what's important, yeah
Gotta keep teaching you
Gotta be your example
That shows His life in all I do

[Chorus]
You are my darling, darling girl
Don't you know you change my world?
You're my little doll so sweet
You nearly knock me off my feet
You're my little darling child
You know I love to see you smile
And God bless the day he sent my little angel to me
Oh yes, God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me

[Outro]
You gon' say something? Huh?
Come on, say something
No? Yeah

[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
And you don't give a damn about the blood and sweat that I spilled
To make it so I'm standing right here
Bet you could bet your soul and your faith in God that I will
Not fold in the face of this fear
'Cause I won't be intimidated by you, pushed down and lied to
I'm not a fool or a punk
And you could try to bruise me and break me, please don't mistake me
See if I don't get right back up

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Now, now see if I don't get right back up
Now, now see if I don't get right back up
Now, now see if I don't get right back up
Now, now see if I don't get right back up

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give me what you need like papa, who shot ya
Separate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on the dime, quick witted
Y'all quit tripping, I don’t have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang bang, little monkey man
Playing with the big guns only get you slain
I ain’t playing, I’m just saying
You ain’t got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down, money, here’s the break down
You can play the bank, I’mma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now, I’m coming to get ya
I’m just a Banksy, you’re a Brainwash
Get the picture? It's like that
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)
Charlie: I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy
Let them do them take care of your own boy"
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt
Pay day, got the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse

CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say a goodbye

VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
To the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would mould me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me
But if they think the old me ever left, then they don't really know me
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, shit I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams in what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands in what not shit, you think I forgot, man naw
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye

VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
Thank god every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live.. in these streets

CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
I just can't say goodbye

I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye

You can take the man out the streets
But you can't take the streets out the man

[Verse 1]
I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

[Verse 2]
I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But mum and dad will not give in

[Chorus]
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No, I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

[Verse 3]
And now I know just what it is
It's called disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

[Verse 4]
Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye-bye

[Chorus]
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No, I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No, I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
It's Britney, bitch
I see you, and I just wanna dance with you

Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you (You, you)
Public display of affection (Ooh)
Feels like no one else in the room (But you)

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking (Keep on rocking)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (They keep watchin')
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying

Gimme, gimme more, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More)

Gimme, gimme more, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More)
A center of attention (do you feel that?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (Yeah)
If you're on a mission (Uh huh)
You got my permission now

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (Keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking, rocking (Oh, uh huh)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watchin' (They keep watching)
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying

Gimme, gimme more, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More)

Gimme, gimme more, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More)

I just can't... control myself
(Mo- mo- mo- mo- mo- more) Ooh
They want more? Well, I'll give them more... ow!
Gimme, gimme more, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme more (Give me more)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More) (Ohoho)

Gimme, gimme more, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme more (Give me more, yeah)
Gimme, gimme (More)

Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Bet you didn't see this one coming
The incredible Lago (Mo- mo- mo- mo- mo-)
The legendary Miss Britney Spears, ha ha
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
'Cause I ain't going nowhere, (Mo- mo- mo- mo- mo-), ha ha
(More)

[Verse 1]
Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus 1]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 2]
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let 'em know
Don't give yourself away

[Chorus 2]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 3]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

[Chorus 3]
I've looked at life from both sides now
Win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life, don't know it at all
I'll Admit My Steps Are Growing Wearier Each Day
Still I've Got A Certain Journey On My Mind
Lures Of This Old World Have Ceased To Make Me Want To Stay
My One Regret Is Leaving You Be-hind
If It Proves To Be His Will That I Am First To Cross
And Somehow I've A Feeling It Will Be
When It Comes Your Turn To Travel Likewise Don't Feel Lost
For I Will Be The First One That You'll See

Chorus:
And I'll Be Waiting On The Far Side Banks Of Jordan
I'll Be Sitting Drawing Pictures In The Sand
And When I See You Coming I Will Rise Up With A Shout
And Come Running Through The Shallow Water Reaching For Your Hand
Through This Life We've Laboured Long To Earn Our Meagre Fare
It's Brought Us Trembling Hands And Failing Eyes
So I'll Just Rest There On That Shore And Turn My Eyes Away
Until You Come Then We'll See Para-dise
Repeat Chorus x 2
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Two cool shorts standin' side-by-side
Yeah, my fuel-injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
Were revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean

Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down

Declinin' numbers at an even rate
At the count of one we both accelerate
My Stingray is light, the slicks are startin' to spin
But the four-thirteen's really diggin' in

Gotta be cool now power shift here we go

Superstock Dodge is winding out in low
But my fuel-injected Stingray's really startin' to go
To get the traction I'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin' that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor, hear his dual quads drink
And now the four-thirteen's lead is startin' to shrink
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
I got a fuel injected engine sittin' under my hood

Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Born of the age
Flagged hopes
Censored rage
The black clad box
Bombs bursting in air
Bleed white red and blue
Cried dawn's early light
For the hope

Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July

Lie by the sword
Black times
False reward
The greetings of doom
So proudly they hail
Lost fortune of free
The stripes and bright stars
Promise lost
Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July

Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July
Girl, you know you knock me out
You're a real girl with your looks now baby
Girl you know you knock me out

Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

1,2,3,4 it's time for me to jet
Where ya goin' off to?
The beach, that's a bet
It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny

Some of those and I won't call 'em whores
'Cause in the 90s you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie
That's how you get your true mock on but
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song

Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks
Make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22
So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to a picnic, we got time
But I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in
Like the old school

Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery
The sun plays, the day is feelin' good to me
I can just semll the funky beats
You know the flavor in between the sheets

I told my boy Big Al, said just keep it straight
Said, I know I got a novelty to validate
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?
He said, "No my brother, you got to get your own"

Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
This party is packed, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'

Jackin' fools for their bunnies
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y
They wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house
So check, check, check it out

My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on
Some soul food, Kool Aid and you know it's on
I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie
Been invited to a block party

So we roll up in all our style
With the brothers yellin', summer bunnies

Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

Let's break it down -
You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby
Let's break it down -
You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby
Let's break it down -
You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too

You know I loved you, baby
I loved you before I could call your name
You know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby
Everything I do is in vain
My brother's in Korea, baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
Brother's in Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
You know I'm having so much trouble woman
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me
VERSE 1
Though I know that we meet ev'ry night
And we couldn't heve change since the last time
To my joy and delight
It's a new kind of love at first sight
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime
You're increasingly sweet
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you ...
REFRAIN
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that your're standing near, and ..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you
VERSE 2
Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out
It will be just as sweet
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you ...
REFRAIN
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and ..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

[Verse]
On a clear day, rise and look around you
And you'll see who - just who you are
On a clear day, how it will astound you
That the glow of your being outshines every star

You feel part of every mountain, sea, and shore
You can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before
And on a clear, on that clear day
You can see forevermore

[Outro]
And on that-a clear, on that clear, clear day
You can see forever and ever and ever
And evermore
Little Surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone
Do you love me, do you Surfer Girl?
(Surfer Girl, my little Surfer Girl)

I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
Do you love me, do you Surfer Girl?
(Surfer Girl, Surfer Girl)

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woody I would take you
Everywhere I go

So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me, do you Surfer Girl?
Oo-oo-ooh

OK
OK
Groovy
If I attend church all day Sunday, come back home and raise
(spoken) I think I feel hur or shall I go a little further, do a little more?
Ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If one day I have ham and bacon, and the next day, ain't nothin' shakin'
No it ain't nobody's bizness what I do

Ain't Nobody's Bizness from earlies 60's

If me and my baby fuss and fight
Well, and the next minute we're all right
It ain't nobody's bizness what I do

If one day we have ham and bacon
And the next day ain't nothing shakin'
I tell you it ain't nobody's bizness what I do

Oh, I'm three, three times seven
Oh, that makes twenty-one
Ah, that ain't nobody's bizness what I do

Oh, if I attend church all day Sunday
And cabaret all day Monday
It ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If I stay out all night
Spending my money I tell you that's all right
Because it ain't nobody's bizness what I do
It ain't nobody's bizness what I do
There once was this girl i knew named Bridgette
She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget
Of course i had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling
I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King
Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip
And asked the DOC do you mind if i nibble this
No, i took her to the back of the studio
And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio
I told the bitch yo please don't bite me
Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
So i slapped the bitch for goin out like a sucker
My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker
To make her stop i pulled up on her extentions
And i left Jimmy standing at attention
The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner
Now i look back on the day I should have peed on her

-Chorus-

(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

(Bridgette) was a girl that i screwed but

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
So you know bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC
And you know i'm still out to get the pussy
Tried to be nice cuz i didn't wanna diss her
Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler
Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee
Then i could tell that she wanted to fuck me
She said Lets skip dinner and i had a fit
At ten dollars a plate i said fuck that shit
Thats the whole reason our relationship was stormy
Why cuz Bridgette was too fuckin horny
She said please excuse me for a minute
To powder my nose i said ya i'm with it
She took a long time the food came and i'm chewin
Thinkin to myself what the fuck is she doin?
Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin
Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin
Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang
But i flipped cuz it was Bridgette gettin gang-banged
-Chorus-

(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but

( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

(Bridgette) was a girl that i screwed but

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
So you know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She says she wants to come over and see me
And do any thing to fuck the DOC
She said she loves me but i didn't say i love her
Went to the store and bought me some rubbers
Then i made a phone call up to the guys
Boy this bitch is in for a big suprise
When she came in i put on a stone record
Said a few lines and the bitch got naked
Later on the bed i told her to suck my dick
And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet
Turned her ass over layed the ho on her back
Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin Amtrak
Dre had the back and Easy had the front
I'm behind Ice Cube cuz thats where the line started
Bitch gettin dogged bye the DOC and NWA
Dogged the bitch out in each in every way
Thats what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette
The dumb ass ho she liked the shit
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but

( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

(Bridgette) was a girl that i screwed but

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)

(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo

(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Sex I the morning,sex at night,sex in the afternoon's alright
Ain't a man on earth,that can stay alive
Without a .....sex drive

Sex (x4)

I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MC's were on the bite
Bittin' my rhymes,stealin' my style
I rocked so hard,it wasn't true
I won the virgin girl,and her MAMA too

Sex (x4)

When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young ladies want a take me home
When the party's over,take me to their house
Throw me in the bed,know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say,"Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes
Your things,your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriends name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move I can't forget
I came,I came,I came again it felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars,my jewels,my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match ICE-T
Sex (x4)

Then she turn out the lights,throw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
And all at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best,the Ice-T chill
Start with her tongue upon the back of my leg
She didn't stop till I hollered screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over,took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page

Sex (x4)

I put it in their blouse
In their brain their little panties that their boyfriend saw
I put it in their mini skirt and up their thigh
Deep,deep girls,I wanna make you cry
I move it in and out,know what I'm talkin' about
Then around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth girl,no joke,I'll take it out
Don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back,might cause a heart attack
I'll put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants
'Cause I fuck with the beat,the only way to dance
Sex (x4)
I think of you with every breath I take
With every breeze that wanders by
And your name is a song
I'll remember the long years through

I breathe your name with every breath I take
And every breath becomes a sigh
Not a sigh of despair
But a sigh that I'll always care

Even now as I walk through the garden
Seems that I hear love say:
"Some day, some way."

And when I sleep you keep my heart awake
And when I wake from dreams divine
Every breath that I take
Is a breath to make you mine
I dreamt I had a good job
And I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade

A hundred dollars
On the Cupid doll
No pretty chic is gonna make me crawl

We're on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman, child and man
Gets a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring
Don't you know you're ridin' with the King

He's on a mission of mercy on a new frontier
He's gonna check us all out of here
Up to the mansion on the hill
Where you can get your prescription filled
Any kind of pills, folks

We're on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody clap your hands
Don't you girls love the way that it seems
Don't you know you're ridin' with the King
Ridin' with the King
Don't you know you're ridin' with the King
Tuxedo and a shiny three thirty five
(that's me)
You can see it in his face
The blues is his life
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
Don't you know you're ridin' with the King

I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a heart made of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die

Don't you know we're ridin' with the King
Don't you know we're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' with me Eric, you're in good hands
You're ridin' with the blues
Don't you know you're ridin' with the King
Yes yes you're ridin' with the King
I wanted to say B.B. King but you know King
Don't you know you're ridin' with the  King
Yes you're ridin' with the King
Yes you are, you're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' , you're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' with the King
Don't you know you're ridin' with the  King
You're ridin' with the King
Yes, you're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' , you're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' with the King
You're ridin' with the King
Don't you know you're ridin' with the  King
Yes, I've packed up my clothes
I'm moving away from your door
Lord, I've packed up my clothes
Said, I'm moving away from your door
I've been your fool for so long
Babe, I won't play that fool no more

I gave you all my money
I work as hard as I can
I came home early one morning
I found you with another man
Babe, I've packed up my clothes
I'm moving away from your door
Said, I've been your fool for so long
And Lord, I won't play that fool no more

Solo

So good-bye baby
You don't even care
Yes, I had a love so strong for you
But you treat me so unfair
Said, I've packed up my clothes
I'm moving away from your door
You know, I've been your fool for so long
And babe, I won't play that fool no more
They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
No, sophisticated lady
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh you cry

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
No, sophisticated lady
I know, you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh you cry
Sophisticated lady
You cry
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Can we make it so that's part of the deal
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line this time

I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign this time

Can you see what I see
Can you cut behind the mystery
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind

I want to come when you call
I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me with these iron walls
We got mountains to climb, to climb
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
I came into this lovely city about three weeks ago today
And I've been trying to find someone that I can talk to, a friendly face to turn my way
I walk these streets in silent sorrow, I walk my feet into the ground
And all I see are cloudy, cold, suspicious faces, I swear to God it brings me down
Is there no one with a smile for me, no one with a hello in their eyes?
Is there no one who will love me and help me through the dark and lonely night?

The park's so green and full of flowers and lovers lying on the lawn
I wish I had a lady here that I could laugh with, sweet Jesus Christ, it hurts me so to be alone
Is there no one with a smile for me, no one with a hello in their eyes?
Is there no one who will love me and help me through the dark and lonely night?

Singing la la la la la la, Singing la la la la la la

This life is hard and full of trouble, it's painful just to live from day to day
But if you're weary and afraid don't turn away now
There's no reason why we have to feel this way
Is there no one with a smile for me, no one with a hello in their eyes?
Is there no one who will love me and help me through the dark and lonely night?

Singing la la la la la la, Singing la la la la la la
I just need someone to talk to. It hurts to be alone
I just need someone to laugh with. It hurts to be alone
I just want someone to love me. I need someone to talk to. And it hurts to be alone

Singing la la la la la la, Singing la la la la la la
Singing la la la la la la, Singing la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
I bruise you, you bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you, and that's all I know

[Verse 2]
All my plans have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you, and that's all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on...

[Chorus]
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass to slow
I love you, and that's all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say the darkest night
There's a light beyond

[Chorus]
But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass too slow
I love you, and that's all I know
That's all I know
That's all I know, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

[Piano Outro]
I'm blessed with everything
A world to which a man can cling
So happy times when I break out in tears
In the back of my mind I still have my fears

I live my life with her
Love her true she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm 'fraid it's gonna change

I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just good the way they'll be
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I lose her
It will always be way in the back of my mind

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams]
When I think about how You saved my soul
I'm compelled to praise You, like a woman out of control
So I lift up holy hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You, mmm, yeah
When I think about what You brought me through
I'm reminded to praise You for all that You had to do
So I lift up holy hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You

[Chorus: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
So from the bottom of my heart I say
(Thank) Oh Lord (Thank) I (Thank You) Thank You
Oh, oh, oh, I just wanna say (Thank)
Gotta say (Thank), thank you (Thank You)
Oh Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Yolanda Adams]
When I think about where You brought me from
I gotta praise You like the victories already won
And I lift my hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You, oh yes
When I think about, oh Lord, yes, why You love me so
I'm compelled to praise You because
I really don't care who's looking and who knows that I love You
And I lift up my holy hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You

[Outro: Yolanda Adams, Choir]
Oh, every day of my life I just wanna say
(Thank) Thank You, Lord (Thank)
I gotta thank (Thank You)
Because of who You've been to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Thank) You've been a shelter in the storm (Thank)
Oh, and I (Thank You)
You've been a rock that I can stand on
Thank You, Lord (Thank)
And I say, Lord (Thank) thank you (Thank You)
You've been a bridge over any kind of water, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Thank) I gotta say (Lord, I thank You)
With all my heart, with all my soul
Everything within me says thank You, Lord
(Thank) Thank you, Lord (Thank) Lord, I thank You (Thank You)
Lord, I thank you, Lord, I thank you (Thank)
For all You done to me, yeah, yeah (Thank, thank You)
Thank You, Lord
There are no words that I can say but You've been there (Thank)
Oh, if I had ten thousand hours (Thank)
Couldn't thank you enough (Thank You)
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh, thank You (Thank)
Thank You, Lord (I just wanna thank You)
I wanna thank, I wanna thank You
I gotta thank You, just wanna thank You
I thank You, yes, I thank You, yes
I thank You, yes, I thank You, yes (Thank)
And I say (I just wanna thank You)
And Lord, I thank You, yes
Thank You
Nights are long since you went away
How I think about you all through the day
My buddy, my buddy, nobody quite so true

I miss your voice and the touch of your hand
I long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you
They are minstrels and beggars
Always in the sight of the king
Sometimes they sleep in the daytime
Come out in the night time and sing
They come into the castle
Through whatever window they can find
They come into your mind
Dreams of flying
Dreams of being free
Nobody can take my dreams from me
Nobody can take my dreams from me

You can bind me in chains
Lock me up in a jailhouse to rot
And if you come to see me
You might think I'm there, but I am not
They can sail into prison
Find a way thru any basement door
They can offer you more
Dreams of flying
Dreams of being free
Nobody can take my dreams from me
Nobody can take my dreams from me
You can take my money
Take my reputation
Even take my colour TV
Nobody can take my dreams from me
Nobody can take my dreams from me

What your friends think they see

[Chorus]
Hey, who loves you better, better, than I do, than I do?
Who knows you better, better, than I do? Say it again

[Instrumental]
Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny and his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He ain't got no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig
Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star
I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna grow and glow
'Til I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
'Til I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' Rage of the Age
Yes I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I said I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I've just been to heaven with someone so true
I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night
She never closed her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away
We only knew she never slept and when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we would all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seems to us that mama heard the turning of the key
For always when we'd step inside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she'd kissed us all goodnight
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
But she seemed to fear the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she said, "When you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through, it may be different then"
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waiting there
Then came the night when we were called together 'round her bed
Â€½The children are all with you nowâ€, the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
That told that she'd just been waiting just to know that we were all alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm, then she went to sleep
My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep
I dreamed about mama last night
It's three AM in the combat zone
Gentlemen start your engines!
They can close this bar, but baby I ain't goin
Gentlemen start your engines!
If you lock up the whiskey, give me gasoline
I got a seven grand redline on the black machine
The dead can do my sleepin', if you know what I mean
Gentlemen start your engines!
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Gentlemen start
Gentlemen start
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Got a little girl here in a pinafore dress
Gentlemen start your engines!
She's got more tricks than you can guess
Gentlemen start your engines!
It's dark outside, but it's darker within
Check the back of my jacket just to see my grin
They don't write pomes about the state I'm in
Gentlemen start your engines!
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Gentlemen start
Gentlemen start
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Bridge 1:
One of these days I'm gonna pull myself togeather
Soon as I finish tearin' myself apart
Like the Devil's Mustangs
I've been ridin' hell for leather
Put away wet and angry in the dark
When the police come you better let 'em in
Gentlemen start your engines!
Don't forget to tell 'em what a sport I've been
Gentlemen start your engines!
I got a head full of vintage TNT
They're gonna blow me up 'stead of burying me
If you're lookin' for trouble come and sit with me
Gentlemen start your engines!
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Gentlemen start
Gentlemen start
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Bridge 2:
One of these days I'm gonna pull myself togeather
Soon as I finish tearin' myself apart
Let me tell you, honey
There's some mighty stormy weather

[Sidney Samson]
I can give you anything you want, oh oh
Guarantee you’ll never go to bed alone

Man I got her, lucky
Look what (What) I've stumbled upon
A woman that sees me (Me) for me
Not what I've done
You give me this (This) feeling
Willing to give you my time
Girl, you make me feel like everything's alright
You're sorta like

[Pre-Chorus]
Hearing the birds chirping (Uh) in the morning light (In the morning)
Or maybe even receiving a kiss goodnight (Kiss goodnight)
Girl, you got me believing we just might
End up being more than just two friends, oh

[Chorus]
When we're together (Mmm), it feels ideal (Woah)
The sunny weather (Yeah) puts a smile right on my face
So why would I ever (Ever) turn my back on what we had?
Oh girl (Oh girl), you always bring that first day of spring

We kept things friendly (Friendly)

Darling, I'm expressing

Willing to give you my ti-i-ime

End up being more than just two friends, woah

[Chorus]
When we're together (It feels), it feels ideal (I feel)
The sunny weather (Weather) puts a smile right on my face
So why would I ever (Uh) turn my back on what we had?
Oh girl, you always bring (Bring) that first day of spring

Winter time is over, there is no other
I would rather spend my time with than you

[Chorus]
When we're together (Hey), it feels ideal (it feels)
The sunny weather (Weather) puts a smile right on my face
So why would I ever (Why? Why? Why? Why?) turn my back on what we had? (We had)
Oh girl, you always bring that first day of spring
When we are together, it feels ideal (Ideal)
The sunny weather (Weather) puts a smile right on my face (Huh)

Oh girl (Uh), you always bring that first day of spring

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen a dead man?
A dead man lying in the road
Have you ever heard his best friend?
Heard his best friend say you'd better go
Before you get fined
Or else you'll do time

[Chorus]
Oh its all about money, money
Money hunny
Its all about money, money
Well alright

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen an old man?
Seen an old man living all alone

Heard an old man hear the way he moans?
Because he's so tired
Because he just got fired

[Chorus]
Oh its all about money, money
Money hunny
Its all about money, money
Well alright

[Bridge]
Lately I've been
Feelin' like the world is weighing
Down on me again
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ooh

[Verse 3]
Have you ever seen a broke man
Seen a broke man begging for his life?
Have you ever heard a broke man
Heard a broke man, heard the pain & strife?
In his one line plea, in his dull edged knife

[Chorus]
He asking for money money yeah money hunny
He asking for money money well alright
Well alright
Well alright
Well alright

[Intro]
DJ Noodles! Mr. 305 checking in!

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Remember that new chico Chris that used to play ball
Skinny with a mushroom cut about yay tall
He's pushin rhymes like what they call him, Pitbull?
I've seen him in a club with a dime every time
Yeah, that's right, that's me
That little chico that 

[?] from 305
Kill me but my legacy won't die
I'ma always rap for M-I-A-M-I

We down to cock, rap the five
Check the books, when it comes to the cocaine we cook
Cause we came from the bottom
We got them things in the bottom man
Straight, raw, uncut, 

[?] step on it

Keep sleeping if you want to
And find your mother trying to wake you up

Or the shit hit the fan
You'll be crying through the tag
C'mon boy, be a man
In the hood they got keys
They got quarters, they got grams
We'll rob everything, I'm from Florida, understand

We were taught to say nothing on the stand
Now that's the real

[Verse 3]
I grew up looking up to drug dealers
Idolizing what they do
Analyzing they every move
Miami breeds them on the regular
But you can tell who's professional
By the way they talk on the cellular
I took your Miami to new heights
Now they coming down looking for Pit
Like I'ma prick at a new price
I done gave the streets new life
Like bricks in the drought
Banana clips man we pulling them out
Hustlers we filling them out
To see if they're willing or not
To put they're freedom on the line
When the feds start playing tricks on they mind
Like them ghettos boys
Fiends on bikes with no tires, that's ghetto boy
So all them hustlers on the corner sitting on milk crates
May your dreams come true one day
To all my boys behind bars, you know who you are
Keep your head up, I promise I got you

[Chorus]
That's dem Miami boyz
With them dade county face
Movin weight, we dem boyz they love to hate
That's dem Miami boyz
With a head full of dreads
Mouth full of golds
Watch out for chicos and them zoes
That's dem Miami boyz
Always lookin for a lick
Be careful we don't end up in yo shit
That's dem Miami boyz
305 till we die
That's right motherfucker let's ride
May I beg you
Out of some lovin'?
One more time
Please, baby

Oh, and may I beg you
Out of some lovin'?
One more time
Oh, may I?

It's not enough
Don't walk away
Girl, please, you be mine
Stay, lady, stay

I wanna touch you
If I may
You are the sunshine
My beautiful, beautiful girl

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
May I just beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'?
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Please, baby
(May I?)

Oh, may I beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'?
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Oh, may I?
(May I?)

The touch of you
Sets me on fire
Can't get enough
You're my desire

My melody
Sweet rhapsody
Girl, let me live in
This fantasy, baby
Satisfy me, ooh
I will satisfy you too
You need a man who'll be slow and
That understands you too, oh

Oh, may I beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Pretty please, baby
(May I?)

Must I beg
(May I?)
You out of some lovin'?
(May I?)

One more, one more, one more, one more
(May I?)
One more time
(May I?)

It's not enough
Don't walk away
Girl, please be mine
Stay, lady, stay
My melody
My rhapsody
Girl, let me live in my
Fantasy

I wanna live it
Let me live my fantasy, please, baby
I need you
Gotta have you, gotta have you, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know what
You tantalize me
You hypnotize me
With your beautiful eyes, baby

You mesmerize me
You satisfy me
You drivin' me wild, oh, baby

May I, must I?
Sugar, may I, must I?
I never know
May I, must I?
Honey, may I, can I?
Must be getting early, clock are running late
Paint my love a morning sky, looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere, light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care, but it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

I see you've got your list out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the jist of it, but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way, the only thing there is to say
Every silver linings got a touch of gray

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

It's a lesson to me, the ablers and the beggars and the seas
ABC's we all must face, try to keep a little grace
I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright
Cow is giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

Shoe is on the hand that fits, that's all there really is to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit, but it's alright
Oh well a touch of gray, kinda suits you anyway
That's all I had to say, but it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

It's a lesson to me, the devils and the East and the free
The ABC's we all must face, try to save a little grace
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no-one showed us to the land
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
Now starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can

And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
No-one speaks and no-one tries
No-one flies around the sun
Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

[Verse 1]
Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river going to flow
It just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

[Verse 2]
Then that light hits your eye
I know, I swear
We'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's alright, sometimes
Sunlight comes streaming through the holes

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry at the doorstep
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid 'cause this rover, crossed over

If I never had a cent I'll be as rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade
Because this rover, it crossed over

If I never had a cent I'll be as loaded as old Rockefeller
With that gold dust 'round my feet
On the sunny side of the street
On the side, at that side of the street that is sunny

[Jamie Foxx:] Haha

[Commentary:] Ladies and gentlemen, Willie Beamen has done it again...

[Foxx:] Gotta get to work, that's right, you know, come on, come on, you know my name

[Chorus:]
My name is Willie... Willie Beamen
I keep the ladies... cream-in'
And all my fans... are screa-min'
You gon' defeat me? You drea-min'

Uh, wild style, profile, Willie Beamen got the ladies in the stand smilin'

Why? Getting down to the nitty gritty, makin' them all feel so they get me

Uh, shakin' like getting they shirt 

[?]

Who is that rockin' the spot? It's Willie Beamen
Who is that keepin' it hot? I'm Willie Beamen
Who is that bringing the pain? It's Willie Beamen
Got the ladies screaming my name (the bitches screamin')

[?]

[Chorus with variations]
Did ya read about the flood?
Happened long time ago
In Tupelo, Mississippi
There were thousands o' lives
Destroyed

It rained, it rained
Both night and day
The poor people was worried
Didn't have no place to go

Could hear may people, cryin' "Lord, have mercy"
'Cause You're the only one that we can turn to"

Happened a long time ago
A little town
Way back in Mississippi
In Tupelo

There was women, and there was children
They were screamin' an' cryin'
Cryin', "Lord, have mercy
You're the only one now, that we can turn to"
Way back down in Mississippi, a little country town
I know ya read about it
'Cause I'll never forget it
The mighty flood in Tupelo, Mississippi
Been years ago

Lord, have mercy
Wasn't that a mighty time?
Tupelo's gone

[Intro]
Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
And oh baby (Oh baby)

[Verse 1]
I cry myself to sleep at night
For fear of another holdin' you tight and oh baby
(Oh baby)
I miss you more with each passin' day
Every night on my knees I pray oh

[Chorus]
Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love I'm just no good
I am just a lonely one

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the wrong I've done
Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone
And oh baby (Oh baby)
I need you more than words can say
Without your love I can pass another day

[Chorus]
Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love I'm just no good
And oh baby

[Verse 3]
I want you to know as long as there's
A heaven above
You'll be my one and only love
And oh baby (Oh baby)
I can't control this growin' need
Girl come and see about me

[Chorus]
Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love I'm just no good
And oh baby
Foot on the gas
I am fast Living, Picture me, I ain't have no pot to piss in
Now I am checking bags, cheifing hash with politicians
Helicopter feds I am .. to get to know ..
I don't want to brag but you ain't tried to hear about
The money drugs and women that I wanna ask
Smoked so much that I am going brain dead
Whores are made of me cause my phone ..
I tell her wow slow down baby... lady
You drive by I ...it's a couple of paper plans
Broadcasting my name over internet
Airways bitches .. on twitter put my music on my space
If you smoked the role and played this I'm gonna hustle
When that midnight hour went chiming
I was in my room alone
Yes, when that midnight hour went chiming
I was in my room alone
Yes, and when I came home this evening
I found my baby gone

Oh, I laid my head on my pillow
I gazed up at the stars up above
Yes, I laid my head on my pillow
Yes, lookin' up at the stars above
I tell you it's a miserable feeling
Oh, when you lose the one you love

Oh, I get the blues at midnight
Oh there's one thing I can't describe
Oh, I get the blues at midnight
Oh there's one thing I can't describe
Yes, and when you look at your baby's picture
Oh, the tears will come from your eyes
Trigger happy
Trigger happy

Got an AK-47, well you know it makes me feel all right
Got an Uzi by my pillow, helps me sleep a little better at night
There's no feeling any greater
Than to shoot first and ask questions later
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day

Well you can't take my guns away, I got a constitutional right
Yeah, I gotta be ready if the commies attack us tonight
I'll blow their brains out with my Smith and Wesson
That ought to teach 'em all a darn good lesson
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day

Oh yeah, I'm trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
(Oh baby, I'm) trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
(Oh, I'm so) trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
Better watch out, punk
Or I'm gonna have to blow you away
Oh, I accidentally shot Daddy last night in the den
I mistook him in the dark for a drug-crazed Nazi again
Now why'd you have to get so mad?
It was just a lousy flesh wound, Dad
You know I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day

Oh, I still haven't figured out the safety on my rifle yet
Little Fluffy took a round, better take him to the vet
I filled that kitty cat so full of lead
We'll have to use him for a pencil instead
Well, I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day

Oh yeah, I'm trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
(Oh baby, I'm) trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
(Oh, I'm so) trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
Better watch out, punk
Or I'm gonna have to blow you away

Come on and grab your ammo
What have you got to lose?
We'll all get liquored up
And shoot at anything that moves
Got a brand new semi-automatic weapon with a laser sight
(Shoot to kill now, shoot to kill)
Oh, I'm prayin' somebody tries to break in here tonight
(Shoot to kill now, shoot to kill)
I always keep a Magnum in my trunk
You better ask yourself, do you feel lucky, punk?
Because I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day

Oh yeah, I'm trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
(Oh baby, I'm) trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy
(Oh, I'm so) trigger, trigger happy
Yes, I'm trigger, trigger happy

Better watch out, punk
Or I'm gonna have to blow you away
(Watch out or I'll blow you away)
Better watch out, punk
Or I'm gonna have to blow you away
(Watch out or I'll blow you away)
Better watch out, punk
Or I'm gonna have to blow you away
(Watch out or I'll blow you away)
Better watch out, punk
Or I'm gonna have to blow you away
(Watch out or I'll blow you away)

-------------------
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I heard some say "Better run away"
Others say "Better stand still"
Now I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead
Who can deny, who can deny
It's not just a change in style?
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Now, I don't know, but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold
Keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late
You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
Now I don't know, but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
When two people have a project
They begin a competition
In which there will be a winner and a loser
State of dominance over one or the other

This dominance is integral to
All human's ways and actions
The necessity to keep at disposition
An object or being desired by another

Knowing through training that if he wants to keep it
Learning everyday, he will have to dominate

Our brain makes us act
Behave and react
A pulsion that drives us to stay alive

Need to satisfy our fundamental needs
The nervous system enables that drive

Through consumerism, escape and struggle
As well as inhibition
All these mechanisms that preserve balance
Biological well being

Seems that until now we have used our brain
Just to dominate, just to dominate

Knowing through training that if he wants to keep it
Learning everyday, he will have to dominate
When two people have a project
They begin a competition

We've to widen the knowledge of
How our brain works to understand
Or nothing will, will ever change
(?)Will to an end

Give birth without seizing
Act and expect nothing
They flower let them free
Unite with the dust and be

Give birth without seizing
Act and expect nothing
They flower let them free
Unite with the dust and be
Of course we have our differences
You shouldn't be surprised
It's as natural as changes
In the seasons and the skies
Sometimes we grow together
Sometimes we drift apart
A wiser man than I might know
The seasons of the heart

And I'm walking here beside you
In the early evening chill
A thing we've always loved to do
I know we always will
We have so much in common
So many things we share
That I can't believe my heart
When it implies that you're not there

Love is why I came here in the first place
Love is now the reason I must go
Love is all I ever hoped to find here
Love is still the only dream I know
So I don't know how to tell you
It's difficult to say
I never in my wildest dreams
Imagined it this way
But sometimes I just don't know you
There's a stranger in our home
When I'm lying right beside you
Is when I'm most alone

And I think my heart is broken
There's an emptiness inside
So many things I've longed for
Have so often been denied
Still I wouldn't try to change you
There's no one that's to blame
It's just some things that mean so much
And we just don't feel the same

Love is why I came here in the first place
Love is now the reason I must go
Love is all I ever hoped to find here
Love is still the only dream I know
True love is still the only dream I know

[Verse 1]
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

[Verse 2]
We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
You've got ventriloquists

[Verse 3]
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows
At the end of my bed

[Verse 4]
The rats and children
Follow me out of town
The rats and children
Follow me out of their homes
Come on kids
We like, fuck a hush on the bus that rush
Acting mad dumb singing bum-stiggedy bump
Plus we was mad young, I remember acting a fool
We laughing at the monkeys fucking at that park zoo
Yo it was crazy cool raising hell at West Street school
Forget what the teacher said, yo, we made our own rules
Remember back in the day carving names in desks
Not even knowing six years later I would see your death
We was just little kids doing childish shit
Til we got to middle school and got wild and shit
And that's when we started chasing girls not even thinking about grades
We was in a new world, our visions started to fade
We was still homeboys acting out and such
Even though we didn't hang out as much

I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
But now I'm asking myself why
'cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
And now we in the High School
Smart fish in the lake
We study trying to keep it real
Staying far from the fake
Its funny how the first month of school started to fly
Before I knew it your life was gone in the blink of an eye
And now I'm stuck in denial
This shit can't be

God tell me why you had to take Noah from me
Why the fuck you had to go and take Noah from me?

I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
But now I'm asking myself why
'cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye

School was crazy there the next day
They didn't think I would last
Seeing phoney bitches trying to get the fuck out of class
Now I tried to play "hard" until I lost my cool
That's when I ran to a stall to shed a tear or two
I knew you full, I broke down and cried puddles
Now everytime I see your picture, my anger doubles
And everytime I see your picture, my anger doubles
I told myself I'd never cry
I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye
And now I'm asking myself why
'cause I know, I know know why
I never even said goodbye

[Verse 1]
Tout ce bruit blanc berce mon amour s'endort
Dois-je m'inquiéter ou bien le réveiller
Tout doucement?

[Chorus]
Me and my love are we going to die?
No one is searching for us and I'm cold
I'm waiting, waiting
Me and my love are we going to die?
Silence is deafening as the (?)

Wait in the snow
There goes my hope
End in the snow
Snow
She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
To melt into this lake
She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The King of Siam
And my Siamese twin
She knows what I'm thinking

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
You know sometimes I can't get to sleep at night
I can't quiet my heart or my mind
I toss and turn, I ache and burn
I get caught in the passing of time

It's like too many miles, too many heartaches
Too much that needs to be done
Yes and too many sidewalks, too many people
Too many hours done

What's on your mind
What's on my mind
Is really quite the same
I've been working so hard
And I'm ready to play
I know just the right game

What's on your mind
Is what's on my mind
That's the way it's gonna be
I'm gonna find me a place I can hide
I want you right next to me
On I've never seen a more beautiful day
It's my favorite time of year
The colors are changing, she's rearranging
And I'm so glad to be here

I've been up and around, I've been lost, I've been found
I've seen love face to face in my dreams
And the things that I know and the things that I show
Are not always just what they seem

What's on your mind
Is what's on my mind
It's just that way
It's like catching a ride
On a beautiful river
Let it carry us all away

What's on your mind
And what's on my mind
Is really nothing new
I want to get you alone
I want to make you my own
Baby, I want to make love with you

What's on your mind
And what's on my mind
Is really quite the same
I've been working so hard
And I'm ready to play
Baby, I know just the right game
What's on your mind
And what's on my mind
Is really nothing new
I want to get you alone
I want to make you my own
Baby, I want to make love with you
Sleepless nights, restless days
Memories of her gentle ways
Love locked out looks for a home
A place to find a shelter from the storm

She said you are the air I breathe
The life I love, the dream I weave
Without a word, with just a touch
Now I realize you meant so much

Been awake so long
I feel like I belong
With the rain

Morning light appears
The feelings of the night
Remain

Somewhere in between
The waking and the dream
Feel you close to me
Think
Upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time, so gold

Steal
Away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time, stay gold

But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory?

And, yes, you will say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray
Of sun so gold
Life
Is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Though
Though gold

Life
Is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things, all things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Though
Though gold

Stay gold
Stay gold

[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
Cause I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

[Chorus 1]
Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live, I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

[Verse 2]
I said maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
Cause I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

[Chorus 2]
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I want to be
But now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
Cause I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

[Chorus 1]
Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live, I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

[Outro]
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
Can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

Oh well

Now when I talk to God
I know he understands
He said "stick by me and I'll be your guiding hand"
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

Oh well
It was the summer of 2001
And I saw the whole fuckin thing
Yo! Can I say fuck on tv?
These guys had on some squad, shit!
It was Lil' Wayne, two puppies, one child, and a dike
But not just any dike, Dick Van Dike
Hey, can I give a few shotouts to my people?
Yo mom! Yo dad! What's up? Cool! I'm on tv!
Hey, I been tellin them guys to get off the corner!
(I mean y'all know I'm good for...)
Wavin' from the Ocean Liner
Beaded, cheering Indians behind them

Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over

Bicycle Rider, just see what you've done-
Done to the church of the American Indian!

Once upon the Sandwich Isles
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii

Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over

Bicycle Rider, just see what you've done-
Done to the church of the American Indian!

Mahala-lu-lei
Mahala-lu-la
Keeni-waka-pula
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over

Having returned to the East or the West Indies...
We always got them confused
I never caught stardust that fell from the skies
I never saw moonlight in anyone's eyes
Then suddenly love kicks in the window
Love knocks down the door
Love, it sat down and told me
Lover, what are you waiting for?
I never heard bluebirds, the songs that they sing
I never get crazy, not even in spring
Then suddenly love struck me like lightning
Love it blew up a storm
Love suddenly grabbed me, and ooh, was it cozy and warm
'Cause I found you, now I no longer just exist
Ooh, what a change, it started from the time we kissed
(And now we hear bluebirds), they hear bluebirds
(We're learning that tune) they like that tune
(And even yon moonlight) all that pretty moonlight
(Comes down about you) Hotdog, them love, it's still on a heaven
Love, it gave me a shove
, I'm a-hearing those
'Cause suddenly
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
That get my mind
Now what are you doin' to me

You a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
You a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
That get my mind
Now what are you doin' to me

Now when you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
That get my mind
Now what are you tryin' to do to me
I said you a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
You a good lookin' woman
Just as sweet as you can be
That get my mind
Now what are you tryin' to do to me

[Intro - DMX:]
Hey you see
This the shit, I be talkin 'bout, know'msayin?
When you don't know, what the fuck is really good know'msayin?
You feel one way, but you know you gotta walk the other way

[Chorus - DMX:]
Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggas like, "Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!"

[DMX:]
Aiyyo it's like this man, shorty got a kid
On some drunk after the club shit, we done did
All week bitches got me hittin the Remy, full throttle
By the time I finish the bottle them bitches is models
Let me break it down like this, here's what happened
I was y'know, tryin to fuck and, once I get to rappin
We at the crib, bitches leave they panties on the doorknob
Puff somethin, ten minutes later we on the floor hard
AH! AH! Huffin and puffin
She screamed it more cause she can't get enough of the lovin
Now, look where it got us, nine months later
Baby is born and I'm realizin I hate her

[Chorus x2]

[DMX:]
"YOU DON'T GOTTA CHILL WITH HER!" Man, they don't know
I'm still with her cause I'm tryin to see the baby grow
That's just the pops in me, see I ain't never had one
And now that I am a father I don't wanna be a bad one
As shorty get older, how do I explain
That I really can't stand his mother? She a pain!
And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate
It was those two bottles of Remy, plus it was gettin late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin to do or to blame
Man I'm the Dog, bitches stay screamin my name
She knew it was a fuck thing, she ain't my wife
So why I gotta pay for her for the rest of my life?

[Chorus x2]

[DMX:]
Child support? You're killin me! But it gets worse
Moms got a thirst that'll get her put in a hearse
Some say it's like a curse, the way she got me locked down
It feel like I'm trapped and I'm tryin to get out now
From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat 'til the Dog got full
Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do
Bust it! From the beginnin you had my mind goin
Look forward to seein you every time knowin
Couldn't see shit cause, love was blind
Fuck it, that liquor is what gets you blind
REAL TALK!

[Chorus x2]

[Jannyce (DMX):]
I told you so (yo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)
Cause that's the way it goes (but I'm stuck with that bitch)
I told you so (my niggas like, "Man fuck that bitch")
I told you so (aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)
Cause that's the way it goes (but here I'm stuck with that bitch)
I told you so (now niggas like, "Man fuck that bitch")

[Outro - DMX:]
Bitch! Fuckin bitch, bitch! Fuckin bitch, stupid bitch
Stanky bitch, fuckin bitch! Bitch, punk ass bitch
Ugly bitch, bitch, fuckin nerves hate you bitch
Fuck that bitch, bitch!
Summer nights and long warm days
Are stolen as the old moon falls
My mirror shows another face
Another place to hide it all
Another place to hide it all

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by

Sleeping with a full moon blanket
Sand and feathers for my head
Dreams have never been the answer
And dreams have never made my bed
Dreams have never made my bed

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by
When I wanna fly above the storm
But you can't grow feathers in the rain
And the naked floor is cold as hell
This naked floor reminds me
Oh the naked floor reminds me

And I'm lost, behind
Words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by

If I should be short on words
And long on things to say
Could you crawl into my world
And take me worlds away
Should I be beside myself
And never even stay

And I'm lost behind
Words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by
I'll follow my secret heart
My whole life through
And I'll keep all my dreams apart
Till one comes true

No matter what price is paid
What stars may fade above
I'll follow my secret heart
Till I find love

No matter what price is paid
What stars may fade above
I'll follow my secret heart
Till I find love

[Verse 1]
The judge decreed it
The clerk he wrote it
Clerk he wrote it down indeed-y
Judge decreed it
Clerk he wrote it down
Give you this jail sentence
You'll be Nashville bound

[Verse 2]
Some got six months
Some got one solid
Some got one solid year indeed-y
Some got six months
Some got one solid, yeah
But me and my buddies all got lifetime here

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the...
Mailed it in the air indeed-y
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere

[Guitar solo]
You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago
And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune
Then you've left her to hunt a new game
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's prob'ly doing the same?

If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed
But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year

I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now
I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free

Now me I play for fortune
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money

Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free
Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their t.v
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony...
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good, for free
Did I see moonlight and magnolia trees?
Smile again, my darling, if you please
Did I hear music on a warm spring breeze?
Speak again, my darling, if you please

Did I feel cool September rain just then?
If you please, touch my cheek with your hand again

When you are near me I can dream with ease
And I'm yours, my darling, if you please

Instrumental

Did I feel cool September rain just then?
If you please, touch my cheek with your hand again

When you are near me I can dream with ease
And I'm yours, my darling, if you please

Miscellaneous
And The Wind Cries Mary
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dress in red
And the wind whispers Mary
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a Queen is weeping
Somewhere a King has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cos the life that they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, "No, this will be the last."
And The Wind Cries Mary

[Verse 1]
I took a look into your ocean heart
And ever since, I stumble through the dark
I'm like a moth attracted to a flame
'Cause since we've met, you know, I'll never be the same
(Oohh-ohh)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm like a tiger but in black and blue
'Cause all my bruises wanna 

[?] for you
I wonder if you'll ever know my name
I wonder if we'll ever ever meet again

[Chorus]
What if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
1 2 3, oh!

[Verse 3]
I'm searching deserts and the morning skies
Just to stare into your diamond eyes
I'll build a rocket and I'll fly to space
Just so that I can touch your picture perfect face
Oh, your picture perfect face, oh

[Verse 4]
I wonder if you'll do the same for me
Or would you stay there and just let me be?
And all my blood will drip the color of gold
'Cause that's the love that runs for you within my soul

[Chorus]
But what if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
But what if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
When if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
And when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
1 2 3, oh!

[Instrumental Outro]
Eyes
Eyes chasing eyes
There you were taking your chances
With daredevil glances in the night
Stunned by the moon
Drawn by the flame
Caught in the act
Of love's oldest game

And warm
Suddenly warm
I felt the heat of the night
The rhythm of light across your face
Kissed by the wind
Won by your hand
Two shot the moon
So it began
Yes

That was the night of Van Gogh
The dazzling dancer of promise
I left the clouds far below
To return once again
To the lips of delicious madness
As you came
To me
Love
Unended love
Yours is the nature of giving
The true art of living on the line
You are with me my dear
More than you know
I touch your lips
You touch my soul
Yes

This is the night of Van Gogh
The dance through the cosmos he promised me
I leave the clouds far below
To return once again
To those lips of delicious madness
You smile as you come
To me

There you were taking your chances

With daredevil glances in the night
There is one kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean
Have you ever heard a church bell tone?
You ever hear a church bell tone?
You ever hear a curchh bell tone?
You know by then I'm dead and gone
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Mark the place where I will lay
There is one kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean
Hey woman, let me have a talk with you
Hey girl, let me have a talk with you
Now you've taken all my money
What are you gonna do

A man's gotta give a woman
Everything she needs
A man's gotta give a woman
Everything she needs
Don't give that woman no more money
If that good girl don't say please

A man's gotta give a woman
Everything she needs
A man's gotta give a woman
Everything she needs
Don't give that woman no more money
If that good girl don't say please
Long night, it's a long night, my friend
The barrooms and the back streets' dead end

Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise
And good times in the air
It was just, it was just another big town
With midnight's neon glare

Long night, it's a long night, I know
The bus rides and the nowhere to go

I've seen what the street corners do
To things like love and dreams
Seen what the bottle can do
To a man with his hopes and his schemes

A long night, what a long night it has been
The wheelers and the dealers, they win

I've tasted the 90-proof gin
And chased it away with the blues
I rarely paid debts that I owed
But I sure have paid my dues
No daylight, just a long night for me
When I was young we wanted to get out the ghetto
But after we moved out of the ghetto
It was hard to get things we needed

I took a picture in the hood
Standing by the door
White T shirt and black khakis
Sagging kind of low
I see the corner that I worked
With my homies in the back
LAPD searching us
Looking for some crack

I don't need to be the king of the world
All I need is some activator
For my Jehri curl

CHORUS:
Compton isn't too far away
Neither is South Central LA
No matter what the cops try and say
We move from South Central
To the desert of the real high
Palmdale-Lancaster
Blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
The sheriff harasses me
He puts me in the choke hold
So bad I can barely breath

I'm the hungry hustler Afroman
I'm going parking lot platinum in my Astrovan

CHORUS:
Compton isn't too far away
Neither is South Central LA
No matter what the cops try and say
I'm selling yay

I see police lights
On palmdale boulevard
Back-up units pulling in
I'm thinking oh my god
I got nowhere else to go
My hands are in the air
I don't know what to do
But you can't have my weed and my brew
My heart tells me this is just a fling
And yet you say our love means everything
Do you mean what you are saying
Or is this a little game you're playing?

My heart tells me I will cry again
Lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through, will I
Be sorry if I do? Should I believe my heart or you?

My heart tells me I will cry again
'Cause lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through, will I
Be sorry if I do? Should I believe my heart or you?
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

[Verse 1]
(That's life, you better believe it)
That's life, that's what people say
You're riding' high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

[Verse 2]
(Now don't you worry)
That's life, funny as it seems (Go head and 

[?])
Some people get their kicks
Steppin' on dreams
But I don't let it get me down (Got a fire, you set it)
'Cause this ol' word keeps getting around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and under
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 3]
That's life, I can't deny it (That's life, gotta believe it)
I thought of quitting
But my heart just won't buy it
If I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd just roll myself up in a big ball and die

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and under
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 3]
That's life, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting
But my heart just won't buy it
If I didn't think it was worth a try (What would you do?)
I'd just roll myself up in a big ball and die
Get in touch with that sundown fellow
As he tiptoes across the sand
He's got a million kinds of stardust
Pick you fav'rite brand, and

Dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream
The next woman I get
She gotta have job
I'm not tryin' to be no pimp
I just don't intend to work to hard
I won't have to buy the groceries
She gotta pay the rent
She gotta fill up my car every day
And give me account of every dime she spend

I made up my mind
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

She gotta make me think she loves me
By staying in her place
And sleep in another room
So she won't be snorin' in my face
And when I ask her for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you have no frown
I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
Yes I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me

Now when I ask for some money
To go out on the town
I want you to hand it to me smilin'
And don't you be no clown
Now that might sound cold to ya baby
You might think I'm unfair
But I've been hurt so many times
Till I, I really don't care

I made up my mind baby
If this is the way life has gotta be
I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me
She wants to die
Like people do
Shallow clicking
Summer or sickening
In that room
High in the heat
A white-hot beehive
Well, she was doomed
She has a wind
To offer the sky
She couldn't stop sinking
She thought she wasn't thinking
She wanted to die
She wants to live
Like people do
She feels like giving
It all away
All to you
Oh, little China girl
Oh, little China girl

I couldn't escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing down

I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh, baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says "sh"
She says "sh"
She says
She says

Oh, little China girl
Oh, little China girl
There's a name for war and killing
There's a name for giving in
When you know another answer
For me the name is sin
But there's still time to turn around
And make all hatred cease
And give another name to living
And we could call it peace

And peace would be the road we walk
Each step along the way
And peace would be the way we work
And peace the way we play

And in all we see that's different
And in all the things we know
Peace would be the way we look
And peace the way we grow

There's a name for separation
There's a name for first and last
When it's all for us or nothing
For me the name is past
But there's still time to turn around
And make all hatred cease
And give a name to all the future
And we could call it peace
And if peace is what we pray for
And peace is what we give
Then peace will be the way we are
And peace the way we live

Yes there still is the time to turn around
And make all hatred cease
And give another name to living
And we can call it peace
Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

They killed us in our tepee
They cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the firesticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun

They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share
I wish I was a trapper
I would give a thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the mornin'
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk about Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
Like the Astrodome
And the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Pocahontas
Darlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

I think of you, think of you every morning
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always

When night began to fall
I cry, cry alone
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight

Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else

[Verse 1]
No, I'm not alone, don't think I wanna be gone
'Cause my thoughts always stay with you
There's no need to be sad, you know where my head is at
And my heart always stays with you
And when I feel kind of lonely
When I need a reason to smile, hey, baby

[Chorus]
You're beside me, everywhere I go
But most of all you stay in my mind
You're beside me, I'm there with you
I'm feeling all the things that you do

[Verse 2]
Seeing you in my mind gonna bring you closer
Even though you're not around
Living every day I can see
I'm gonna have my share of ups and downs
When I feel (Feel) kinda lonely
When I need (Need) a reason to smile

[Chorus]
You're beside me, everywhere I go
Most of all you stay in my mind
You're beside me, you're everywhere
Here with me wherever I go

[Bridge]
Everywhere I go
I like the way you give that good-time feeling
Everywhere I go
Right now you know the way you've got me feeling

[Verse 3]
No, you're not alone, don't think I wanna gone
'Cause my thoughts always stay with you
There's no need to be sad, you know where my head is at
And my heart always stays with you
When I feel (Feel) kinda lonely
When I need (Need) a reason to smile

[Chorus]
You're beside me, you're everywhere I go
Most of all you stay in my mind
You're beside me, you're everywhere
Here with me wherever I go

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Everywhere I go
I like the way you give that good-time feeling
Everywhere I go
Right now you know the way you've got me feeling
Everywhere I go
Honey, I like the way you give that good-time feeling
Everywhere I go
Right now you know the way you've got me feeling

[Chorus]
You're beside me, everywhere I go
Most of all you stay in my mind
You're beside me, everywhere
Here with me wherever I go
You're beside me, everywhere I go
Most of all you stay in my mind
You're beside me, you're everywhere
Here with me wherever I go
You're beside me, everywhere I go
Most of all you stay in my mind
You're beside me
River, there are no stars in the city
Here there is no telephone in the trees
Beautiful days all on the water
And all I can do is write you a letter
River, it's cold here in the morning
Later, I can see it in your eyes
Mild and white, we follow the canyons
Quiet at night, we stare at the sky
Leaving you now will never change things
Running away will just change the view
All I can see is the highway
All I can see is you
River, you'll carry me thru the fire
Maybe you'll drown me in your arms
But if I die like that
It won't be like dying
When I rise again, the ashes are gone
Leaving you now will never change me
Running away will just change the view
All I can see is the highway
All I can see is you

[Verse 1: Wanya]
Couldn't have been more than a day over three
Tried to do and be everything that I saw on TV
That won't work now like it did work back then
But then it was easier to imagine for me

[Verse 2: Nathan]
We never had to care which party would win
Would the fighting go on, would it ever end? Yeah, yeah
Not knowing right from wrong, was the safest way to be
When we were free, so young and free

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
And we didn't have a care in the world
We were just too young to understand, at all
And if you feel what I'm feelin'
Then you remember

[Chorus]
Tell me do you remember when
When everything in life was so much better then
Tell me do you remember when
Do you remember?
Do you, do you remember?

[Verse 3: Wanya]
We never had to save for a rainy day
Just enjoying this time in our lives, come what may
But you and me we never needed to think about the time
Because we were free (then we were free)
So young and free

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan & Shawn]
And we didn't have a care in the world
And we were just too young to understand, at all
Ooh, and since you feel what I'm feelin'
I know you remember

[Chorus]
Tell me do you remember when
When everything in life was so much better then
Tell me do you remember when
Do you remember?
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Tell me do you remember when
When everything in life was so much better then
Tell me do you remember when
Do you remember?
Tell me do you remember when
When everything in life was so much better then
Tell me do you remember when
Do you remember?
Do you remember? Do you remember?
Tell me do you remember when
When everything in life was so much better then
Tell me do you remember when
Do you remember?
Do you, do you, do you remember?
I know you remember
Was it in Tahiti? Were we on the Nile?
Long long ago, say an hour ago
I recall that I saw your smile

[Intro]
Ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble

[Verse 1]
Baby you remind me of a pretty rose
That's awfully painful to my touch
And though there's thorns underneath the rose
Baby you hurt twice as much

[Verse 2]
You made me cry a thousand times, ha
And leaving me with a broken heart
I should stand many miles away
But I'm right here in your arms

[Chorus]
Now ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble, yeah
Now ain't that asking for trouble
I said ain't that asking for trouble

[Verse 3]
Baby the way I'm at your beck and call
I must be hypnotised
'Cause I, I know I've got sense enough to know
That loving you ain't wise
Sure as the sun may shine
My heart will be in pain
Like a child that's seen papa
I'm in your arms again

[Chorus]
Now ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble, yeah
Now ain't that asking for trouble
I said ain't that asking for trouble

[Verse 4]
Baby I, I can't stop my loving you
Until you hurt me so much
My plans not to see you again
Baby but your tender touch
I guess I'm just too weak for you
I shoulda been so long gone
But here I'm in your arms again
And I'm still holding on

[Chorus]
Now ain't that asking for trouble
Now ain't that asking for trouble, yeah
Now ain't that asking for trouble
I said ain't that asking for trouble

["It's Only Rock 'n' Roll"]
If I could stick my hand in my heart
Spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy you, would it slide on by you?
Would you think the boy is strange, ain't it strange?
If I could win, if I could sing
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried, if I cried?
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it
I know it's only rock 'n' roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
I really, really, really, really, do, do, do, do, hey

Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver knows he's doing all right
Hear him with the women just around midnight

How come you taste so good?

["You Can't Always Get What You Want"]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes you might find you get what you need

["Honky Tonk Women"]
You need honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

["Under My Thumb"]
Under my thumb, the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb, the girl who once pushed me around
It's down to me, yes, it is, the way she talks
When she's spoken too down to me
The change has come, she's under my thumb

["Ruby Tuesday"]
So, goodbye ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day?
Still, I'm gonna miss you

["Miss You"]

So many a man sold in faith

Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name

Cause what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game
(Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo)

["Get Off of My Cloud"]
I said, hey, you, get off of my cloud
(Hey, you)
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
(Hey, you)
Hey, you, get off of my cloud

Don't hang around cause two's a crowd

Laughter, joy, and loneliness
And sex and sex, and sex, and sex
Look at me, I'm in tatters

["Let's Spend The Night Together"]
This doesn't happen to me every day, oh my

No excuses offered anyway, oh my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girlie action
Cause I try

And I try

I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
Satisfaction, satisfaction, hey
I've been around the world, seen everything
And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

I've loved in sunshine, I've loved in the rain
All of the women who know me call that loving man
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

Some people go to school to try and learn their trade
Yes, but I'm a lover, a lover by nature
That's why I know, I know, I know I've got it made

Yes, you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun
But they tell me the reason I'm the king
I'm a lovin' son of a gun
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

[Intro]
Whoa, yeah

[Chorus 1]
With a child's heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play

[Verse 1]
No need to worry
No need to fear
Just being alive
Makes it all so very clear

[Chorus 2]
That's with a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown

[Verse 3]
Love is it's welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
No grownup thoughts
To lead our hearts astray

[Bridge]
Take life easy, easy, so easy
Like a child so gay and carefree
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Love is it's welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
The whole world smiles with you, ha
As you go your own merry way

[Chorus 2]
'Cause with a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
We've got no reason to frown
... prayer
Take a look at me baby
I am a teenage prayer
When it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is...

(Take a look at me babe)
(Good, go 'head)
(I'm your teenage prayer)
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look at me baby)
I am your teenage prayer
(Yes I'm your teenage prayer)
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look over here at me baby)
I am your teenage prayer
(I'm your teenage prayer)

Take a look and when it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is say you're mine
I come runnin' anywhere
Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
Take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage dream
Take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage dream
(Yes and I'm a dream)

When it's rainy in your heart
Just come to me and start
Tell me how I do and cheer
Oh, just come and take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage prayer

Well oh, let it rain
For any dime just come and see my face
Any time you just got to read my lines
I won't give you any respect
Oh, no

Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look over here at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(Take a look at me baby, I'm a teenage prayer)
Come and take a look at me baby
(Yes take a look over here baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
('Cause I'm your teenage prayer)
When it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is say you're mine
I come runnin' anywhere
Take a look at me baby
(Take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(Prayer, hair, where)

Yes I'm your teenage prayer
You might think I'm not
Somebody might think I'm nowhere
But I'm here to tell you I'm your teenage prayer
I know what you need
I can feel it in my bones and I feel it on my throne
You're my teenage prayer
Any day any night
You just come to me when you're in fright
And I'm your teenage prayer

Take a look at me baby
(Just take a look at me baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(You know I'm your teenage prayer baby)
Take a look at me baby
(Take a look at my hair baby)
I'm your teenage prayer
(I'm the teenage pair)
When it's cloudy all the time
All you gotta do is say you're mine
'Cause I come runnin' to you anywhere
Oh, yeah, oh you're so real
Take a look at me baby
I'm your teenage prayer

[Verse 1]
The day seems so very long
But I'm trying to be strong
(Trying to be strong)
Well, hold on, I say
Things will soon turn my way
And then I'll have a clear view
But I gotta keep

[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
(Keep your head to the sky)
I don't need to tell you why
(I don't need to tell you why you gotta keep)
Keep your head to the sky
(Keep it up, keep it up)
I don't need to tell you why

[Verse 2]
I sometimes get worried
And I wonder why I worry
'Cause I know that I will make it through the storm
I'm tryin' not to lose my cool
Because if in this world I do
The only person that's gonna miss out on everything is me
And I gotta keep

[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
(Keep your head to the sky)
I don't need to tell you why
(And I don't need to tell you why you gotta keep)
Keep your head to the sky
(Keep it up, keep it up)
I don't need to tell you why

[Bridge 1]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, oh
Keep your head up (Keep your head)
Don't you look down for nobody
(Don't look back, don't you look down for nobody)
Don't you do it, don't you do it
Keep your head

[Chorus]
Keep your head (Keep it up, keep it up)
I don't need to tell you why
(I don't need to tell you why)
Keep your head
(Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, keep it up)
I don't need to tell you why

[Bridge 2]
Everyday's a struggle
But struggling to be
Is very hard, so very hard
Because I'm out here trying to do the right thing
And when I look around here's the wrong thing
Tempting me to make me disagree
About how I feel about me
But I gotta keep

[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
I don't need to tell you why
(I'm telling you a reason you should keep your head)
Keep your head to the sky
(I don't need to tell you why, but you should keep your head up)
I don't need to tell you why
(All the way, don't look back, don't do it, no no no no)
Keep your head to the sky
(Be a leader, I'm telling you, yeah)
I don't need to tell you why
(I, I, I don't need to tell you why)
Keep your head to the sky
(You should keep your head up high)
I don't need to tell you why
This is the way that I do feel
I feel it every where I go
I feel just like an engine
That lost its driving wheel

I'm feeling down as a man can feel
Since my baby said that she don't want me hangin' round
Feel like a tin can just a rusting way out on that dumpin' ground
It sure is hard to stumble down when you ain't got no place to fall
Seems like in the whole wide world I ain't got no place at all Yeah

Well I'm feeling like a stranger here
I feel like a stranger everywhere
Feel like I like to go back home
But I'm even a stranger there

Well I've tried, God knows I've tried
To go my way and leave the worry past behind
But every time the sun goes down
My baby stays on my mind
I Couldn't Care Less
()

Balmy breezes are blowing - each star in the sky is glowing
But I couldn't care less
Lovely night birds are winging - and filling the night with singing
But I couldn't care less

Oh how perfect the setting - but how do I start forgetting
I'm alone where we walked before
For without the warmth of your caress
It's a cold and dreary world - I guess

And I couldn't care less - unless
You could care once more
Love is a many-splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring
Love is nature's way of giving, a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing

Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
Now what can you tell them?
What can you say that won't make them defensive?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like they're peaceful, but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

[Verse 1]
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch
The band is playing "Dixie," a man got his hand outstretched
Could be the Fuhrer
Could be the local priest
I said sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 2]
He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands are be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Somewhere mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy
She's holding them shoes and that little broken toy
And he's following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Instrumental]
All around the water tank
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain

I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He says, "If you've got the money
I'll see that you don't walk"

I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show
"Get off, get off, you railroad bum"
He slammed the boxcar door

He put me off in Texas
A state, I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above

Nobody seems to want me
Or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going to Dixie Land
Though my pocketbook is empty
My heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Just waiting for a train
Barbara gently smiling for me
Tender and warm
Shining with love
And I love you, I love you, love you
God I do
Oh I love the way you love me

Every day is a special day for me
Living with you
Just being with you
All my love, for all my life, my love, my love
Just for you
For I love to sing songs for you

Ah

I love you

[Chorus]
Give me that old (Old)
Time (Time)
Old time lovin'
Give me that old (Old)
Time (Time)
Old time lovin' yeah

[Verse 1]
It was good enough (It was good enough)
For dear old mother and father (For dear old mother and father)
That is how I know (That's how I know)
That's alright for me

[Chorus]
What I need is that good old (Old)
Time (Time)
Old time lovin' yeah
It's got to be rockin' (Rockin')
Reelin' (Reelin')
Yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Music will make you make you - make you move your feet yeah
Keep tryin to love you baby - and you're out in the street

[Chorus]
But what I need is that good old (Old)
Time (Time)
Good old time lovin' yeah
It's got to be rockin' (Rockin')
Yeah and reeling (Reeling)

Yeah and the only thing I want you to do is come on home (Home)
Come on home (Home)
Yeah don't let your friends turn your back on me baby

Come on old (Old)
Time (Time)
Old time lovin, yeah
Waitin' for a better day
Waitin' for another day
Come on home
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 2]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day

[Break]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you want to do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away
That's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
Way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation
Oh, for the old folks at home
Ah-oh-oh!
Oh, my my!
Well, way down upon the Swanee River
Far, far away-hey
Whoa, that's where my heart is yearning ever
Home where the old folks stay
All up and down the whole creation
Sadly I roam
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation
And for the old folks at home
All the world is sad and dreary
Ev'rywhere I roam
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Hush my darling , sleep my lover
There'll be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the Lord arranges

Oh my darling , now I found you
Want to live all my life around you
You're my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow

I just want to hold you forever , forever
Loving one another that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

Oh my darling , if you leave me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Not knowing angel , what's coming after
Never hearing you're golden laughter

Oh my baby , hearts like thunder
Can't escape from the spell I'm under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure
I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me
Head on my pillow just thinking of you
Head on my pillow
So lonesome and blue
I wonder where you are tonight
And if you miss me, dear
My heart tells me you can't deny
My arms know you left near
Head on my pillow
My thoughts turn to dreams
Head on my pillow
Like heaven it seems
I see a vision build a home of happiness divine
My head on my pillow
With yours close to mine
The old home town looks the same as I step off the train
Meeting every train in my mind's eye till the man in mail came
Hair like gold, lips like cherry
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Green, green grass of home, green green grass of home
Only dream I know of is to be found hair like gold, lips like a cherry
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
They'll all come to greet me, on the steps of my sweet dream
It's good I dreamt the green, green grass of home
I wait and look around me at the broken walls that surround me
And out here I was on the ground
There's a garden in the path of progress unharmed through winter's day break
Then I'll touch the green, green grass of home
They'll all come to greet me from the chains of the old dark hollow
The green, green grass of home
They'll all come to greet me on the steps, my sweet dream

[Intro x2]
Come on, come on
Suppertime

[Verse 1]
It's all up under you now, all up in my house
I don't know when, don't know how
You thought I was going out

When the night has come
And as soon as you began to unwind
Is when I lost my mind
I think it's supper time

[Chorus +ad libs]
This heat's gettin' close to my, suppertime
I can't believe my, suppertime
Oh, I'mma feel lost, supper time, hey
Ooh, sing it, barbie girl
Come on, come on, ooh
Suppertime, oh, ooh suppertime

[Verse 2]
That mamba knocking us out
I chant him knocking you down
Got all up on my couch
How long has he been around?

Don't cut off the lights, let 'em shine
'Cause I can't find nothing right
With your bump and grind
I think it's suppertime

[Chorus +ad libs]
This heat's gettin' close to my, suppertime
I can't believe my, suppertime
Oh, I'mma feel lost, supper time, hey
Ooh, sing it, barbie girl

[Instrumental interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's suppertime

[Chorus +ad libs]
This heat's gettin' close to my, suppertime
I can't believe my, suppertime
Oh, I'mma feel lost, supper time, hey
Ooh, sing it, barbie girl
Ooh, suppertime
Death to the world! Cthulhu's come:
Let Earth abhor this thing
Let every mind prepare for doom
As anguish and woe he'll bring
As anguish and woe he'll bring
As anguish and woe he'll bring

Up from the sea, R'lyeh did rise:
The cultists awestruck dumb
With ancient rites so wretched and perverse
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come

Death to the world! Cthulhu reigns
The Great Old Ones Destroy

With wrath and doom, so cruel and foul
Replete with obscene joy
Replete with obscene joy
Replete with obscene joy
He rules the Earth with dreadful might
And through our ghastly dreams
His twisting turning tentacles
Elicit from us maddened screams
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come
Cthulhu's time has come
It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go

Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again

With a girl the lonely sea looks good with moonlight
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight

Been so long
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
Well I've been thinking 'bout
All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again

Ow!
Saturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear, clear and blue
But Saturday sun, it came without warning
So no one knew what to do

And saturday sun brought people and places
That didn't see much in their day
And when I remember these people, these people and places
They were really, really too good in their way, in their way

And saturday sun won't come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through, through your brain
Just think about, think about people
In their season, season and times
Just returning again and again

So Sunday sat in Saturday sun
And wait for a day gone by

[Verse 1]
This little girl of mine
I wanna say that she's so fine
And each and every day
I make sure she has her way
Now we don't feel tied down
Although our hearts are bound
I don't have to chase her all over town
My baby she's always around

[Chorus]
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

[Verse 2]
Now she's so good to me
I guess that's why I feel fancy free
Just to see the glow in her eyes
Makes me once again realize
I love her with all of my heart
And I know we'll never ever part
I never heard about or caught her playin'
I guess that's why you always hear me sayin'

[Chorus]
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

[Verse 3]
When I visit at her home
Other fellas never, never ring her phone
She let's them know just where they stand
She tells them all that I'm her man
And when we're out on a date
All the fellas wait till I walk away
They try to beat my time
She tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine

[Chorus]
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

[Verse 1]
I feel numb from the waist up
Eyes walk right past the world's hurt
Better is what the world deserves
Why's humanity just another word?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, you need me (I need you), I need you (I need you)
To give me a hand, it's never too soon
We say we wanna change (Yeah), we say we wanna grow
But all we do is destroy, leavin' no room for love

[Chorus]
We spend all day talkin' (Talkin')
We spend all night layin' the dream out
But we never wake up to this vision of peace
Between you and between me
We're just sleep walkin' (Sleep walkin')
Oh, we're just sleep walkin' (Sleep walkin')

[Verse 2]
It's not a false alarm (No), we gotta get it up (Yeah)
I'm tryin' to put water on your face
And shine a little sunlight your way
We gotta remove the covers (Oh)
That have made us blind (Made us blind)
We're walkin' in circles
And we're runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
You need me, I need you
To give me a hand, it's never too soon
We say we wanna change, we say we wanna grow
But all we do is destroy, leavin' no room for love

[Chorus]
We spend all day talkin' (All day, yeah)
We spend all night layin' the dream out
But we never wake up to this vision of peace
Between you and between me
We're just sleep walkin'

[Bridge]
I know you're sleeping peaceful
It's easy to change your mind
I've heard your thoughts
But I need your actions to save someone's life
We gotta reach past the top
There's more road beyond the finish
And enough's never enough
So give the world back its love

[Pre-Chorus]
You need me, I need you (I need you)
To give me a hand, it's never too soon
We say we wanna change, we say we wanna grow
But all we do is destroy, leavin' no room for love

[Chorus]
We spend all day talkin' (All day, yeah)
We spend all night layin' the dream out
But we never wake up to this vision of peace
Between you and between me
We're just sleep walkin'

[Outro]
We need it, we need it, we need it, yeah
We need it, we need it, we need it, oh oh, oh
We need it, we need it, we need it, oh oh
We need it, we need it, we need it
We need it, we need it, we need it
Your love, your love, your love

I feel numb from the waist up
Eyes walk right past the world's hurt
Better is what the world deserves
Why's humanity just another word?
Public Enemy number 2, the flow is illegal
And these ain't diesel, all fucking Evisu
These is Levi's, equipped with the desert eagle
Run, tell your people, that nigga get evil
Throw em off the bridge like Knievel

Finding you was incredible
Losing you would be unbearable
For you woman, I'd go through hoops of fire
Somethings are impossible
'Cause some folks never try
Some folks see an obstacle
And they never get by
I used to be that way before
I met you, baby
But the force of your gentle touch
Too much is not enough for me
Whoa, I'll go through hoops of fire
I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you
I'll go through hoops of fire
To prove to you
(To prove to you)
That no one else will do
And nothing can keep me from you
No, no, no, no, baby
Finding you was incredible
In every way, you show me why
(Why girl)
Losing you would be unbearable
I'd lose the meaning you've brought to my life
You've done for me
What no one else could ever do
Through your love I've got the strength
To face up to anything
God, I'm telling you the truth
I would go through
(Hoops of fire)
To prove to you
(To prove to you)
That no one else will do
(Nothing)
Nothing
(Will keep me)
Keep me from you
I'll take a chance
I'd risk it all
I'll get back on my feet
If I should happen to fall
It's all because of you
That I am what I am
I'll get down on my knees
If you ask me to, don't you know
I'd go through
(Hoops)
Oh yes I will baby
(Of fire)
Whoa, I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you
(Ah hoops)
Ah my, my, my, my, my, my, my, baby
(Of fire)
Oh yes I will, I'll prove to you
(Prove to you)
That no one else is gonna do
No
(Nothing)
Nothing
(Could keep me)
Is gonna keep me from you, baby, baby
(Oh oh, hoops of fire)
I'll go through hoops of fire
Oh I'll do anything
(Anything)
To get close to you, baby

[Verse 1]
In the meantime, what do you do
When there's no one left but you
And you're alone?
How do you feel when the one you love
Doesn't, doesn't seem real?
Do you run, or do you try to heal
The hurt inside?
But oh, but in the meantime, oh

[Chorus]
I have found within myself (I found)
Everything I need to get by (Everything, you're all I need to get by)
'Cause I ('Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I)
Know what to do in the meantime (Said I know, know, know)
Continue to love you (I'm gonna continue to love you)

[Verse 2]
There is no need for you to fear
For I am here, I'll be right here
All of your life
And I am willing and able to pull you
Pull you through, through the storm
That might await you on the outside
And all of your fears and your doubts will no longer exist
Because God has granted you the greatest wish
And He has done the same for me
'Cause right now, you're all I need

[Chorus]
I have found within myself (I found)
Everything I need to get by (Everything, you're everything I need to get by)
'Cause I ('Cause I)
Know what to do in the meantime (Ooh, oh, I know what to do, know what to do in the meantime)
Continue to love you (Continue)

[Outro]
In the meantime what do you do
When there is no one, left but you
And you're alone? Oh (But in the meantime)
In the meantime, oh (But in the meantime)
What do you do in the meantime? (But in the meantime)
There is no need for you to have no fear (But in the meantime)
For I am here (But in the meantime)
But in the meantime (But in the meantime)
But in the meantime (But in the meantime)
Oh, I'm willing and I'm able (But in the meantime)
To pull you through the storm
Pull you through the storm (But in the meantime)
In the mean— (But in the meantime)
Yeah
John Lennon: This time, you get it in the middle of the song

[laughs]
I had to laugh myself, you know
Wild, wild

Paul McCartney: One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene!
Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course, Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
La la la la la la la la la la la
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. Kite performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

[Outro]
One hand will take, one hand will give
That's all we know and that is how we live
One day hello, next day goodbye
And everyone just stay high

Same old story, same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going, then you're gone
Same old story, same old song

One builds you up, one tears you down
To some you're a saint, to others you're a clown
What can you do, just see it through
And hold on to what is left to you

Same old story, same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going, then you're gone
Same old story, same old song

[Intro: George Michael]
Do do do do, whoa whoa whoa
Do do do do

[Verse 1: George Michael]
As around the Sun the Earth knows
She's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's a cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be lovin' you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

[Chorus]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day

[Verse 2: George MIchael & Mary J. Blige]
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past
But that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
And I'll be loving you always

[Chorus]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
(Now ain't that lovin' you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

[Bridge: George Michael & Mary J. Blige]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
(True love don't want a thing)
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever
Another day

[Verse 3: George Michael & Mary J. Blige]
As around the Sun the Earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
That I'll be lovin' you always

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & George Michael]
Lovin' you until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Lovin' you until the ocean covers every mountain high
Lovin' you until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Lovin' you until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
(Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah yeah)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(I'll be loving, loving, check this out)
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Always
Always
Always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Always
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
Check this out
Always
Always
Always
I'll be love, love, yeah
Always
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Parrots live at sea
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more
Born on a quiet morning
Just a dream in someone's eyes
A dream that's like a promise meant to be
Giving rise to speculation
On a place called paradise
If I've ever been there
It's when you were with me

You're so beautiful
I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

I remember some hidden valley
Where the skies are never still
And alpine meadows burn in the evening light
I remember the path to glory
And the way around the hill
I remember true love's eyes
Shining in the night
You're so beautiful
I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

And if paradise is everything you see
Then the place you must be coming from
Is ecstasy

You're so beautiful
That I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

Just want to see you again
I want to be with you again
I just need to love you again
Just wanna touch you again
I just need to love you again
I want to be with you again
Touch you again
Love you again
With you again
You're a stranger in my arms
When i saw you standing there
Without a wooly ho i hair
You're a stranger in my arms
You're a stranger in my arms
I want it so much
And me on a road somewhere
You're a stranger in my arms
When the lights are very low
And the sky is on the celing
And there's no one there to know
Oh its gone off
I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
For a heart of gold
You keep me searching
For a heart of gold
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas
Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow
Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird
You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat
An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace
My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome
For one old fashioned Christmas back home

[Intro]
Honey, come here
I wanna show you something
You know what it is
Listen

[Verse 1]
Been away for thirty days
Now I'm home, and I'm here to stay
I've been thinking things have been gone
But you already know 'cause I told you on the telephone
I remember your fingers, do you remember my hands?
We did all we could, 'cause that's all we can
When we're apart, you got my heart
But when we're together, you have all of me baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, aah, I got you (I got you, baby)
Mmm, mmm, you're mine (All mine, baby, all mine)
Ooh wee, I'm wit'cha
Your love is right on time

[Verse 2]
Stop, stay where you are
Coming to you
All of  things we talked about, baby
I wanna do to you
So take off your clothes (take off your clothes)
Leave them at the door (leave them at the door)
But keep on your shoes
One leg upon the table
Arch your back
Look at me and smile
'Cause you know what I'm about to do
Baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, aah, I got you (I got you, baby)
Mmm, mmm, you're mine (All mine, baby, all mine)
Ooh wee, I'm wit'cha
Your love is right on time

Ooh, aah, I got you (I got you, baby)
Mmm, mmm, you're mine (All mine, baby, all mine)
Ooh wee, I'm wit'cha
Your love is right on time

[Bridge]
This feels so good I know
I know it feels right
I wish this thing could last forever, oh yes
But you can't stay
'Cause my wife's on her way

[Chorus]
Ooh, aah, I got you (I got you, baby)
Ooh, you're mine
Ooh wee, I'm wit'cha
Your love is right on time

Ooh, aah, I got you (I got you, baby, yeah)
Mmm, mmm, you're mine (You're all mine)
Ooh wee, I'm wit'cha
Your love is right on time

Make me wanna say yeah...yeah...
Oh oh oh oh...
A moment ago it seemed it was yesterday
You were here with me and everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do with all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude with the smell of your perfume
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
'Cause lovin' you is all I ever had, still lovin' you is all I ever have
This wasn't what I wanted to be, a man in misery
Girl I look back a thousand times and can't believe that you left me
(Why you leave me baby)
Why can't you understand my pain, how can I explain
Girl I don't know what I'm doin' wrong, I can't believe that your love is gone
'Cause you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand, yeah
(Oh, oh )
Said you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
See lovin' you is all I ever had
(I had, I had)
Baby lovin' you is all I ever had
Ooh yeah, you're all I need, you're all I see
And I wish that we could do it again
'Cause you never took the time to know me
(Baby you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand, yeah
(Oh, oh)
Said you never took the time to know me, yeah
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man
(Oh)
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man
We can't make it baby
We can't last another year
We can't make it baby
We can't last another year
Well I try to treat you kind baby
But it seems like you got the wrong idea

I give you all my money baby
To buy those real fine clothes
I give you all my money baby
To buy those real fine clothes
I bought you a home and everything baby
Now you're trying to put old me outdoors

When I first met you baby
You had to do it out in the street
When I first met you baby
You had to do it out in the street
I put clothes on your back, baby
I put shoes on your feet

It seems right to me baby
Since you got your feet up off the ground
It seems right to me baby
Since you got your feet up off the ground
You're a real big-shot woman now
You don't want old me around

[Chorus: x4]
I got money on the drink
And half on the dank

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, thank God I'm a millionaire
Hard body, these other boys teddy bears
Fuck with me momma, I know you want a G
And I'm a real Blood, if you want R&B
Just call me Carter honey, if you can't say the baby
Bitch I'm so fuckin' hot, I feel radiated
Hoe I'm so fuckin' fly, my eyes are Aviators
I'm stuck at the top floor in the elevator
'Cause I'm high, dumb high
Nigga, I could look into the sun's eyes
Young guy, but rich though
And I keep a rag on me like a '64, like a '64
You know I got that bounce
It's Mister-Quick-to-Pour-a-Eighth-In-a-20-Ounce
Okay I'm Terminator, you niggas Minnie Mouse
And I'm Young Money anyhow

[Chorus: x9]
I got money on the drink
And half on the dank

[Verse 2 - Mack Maine]
I saud it's hood shit baby, so you know it's all thugs
Rockstar life, lotta sex, and a lotta drugs
It's O.G. kush, purple dro, and pine bud
Have a real nigga feelin' like he's so fucked up
Have a fake nigga feelin' like he's so bucked up
There go the weed man, Spitta back the truck up
There go the lean man, Thugga we done lucked up
I mix the two dro by my bitch and then we rough fuck
I leave a Crego to the lot and pick a Jag' up
If you was in my shoes, nigga you could brag 'cause
Weezy he got me, Baby he got me
Young Money, Cash Money, bitch that's my posse
.40 cals with broke safeties just try to rob me
Million dollar man feelin' like Ted DiBiase
Now let me tell you, if I'm missin' a bush
Shit'll get uglier than New York from the 'Flavor Of Love'

[Chorus x9]
I got money on the drink
And half on the dank
Down to earth once again
I've been away too long
I got lost but then I came home again
Home where I belong

Down to earth just in time
To the love I failed to see
I gave up a dream for a change of scene
Now I'm back where I should be

Down to earth, down to earth
All that I lost I have found
What's it worth, this bitter earth
Whithout your love around

I got lost in the crowd
That's the price I had to pay
'Cause I couldn't find what I left behind
'Til love showed me the way, yeah

Down to earth down to earth
All that I lost I have found
What's it worth, this bitter bitter bitter earth
Without your love around, yeah
Welcome home, little fool
And it's been a long hard time
From a world unreal to the things I feel
Where love was waiting all the time

Down to earth, down to earth
Down, down to earth, yeah yeah
He: Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine
She: Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache
Tangerine, with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says "From Macy's Mezzanine"
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl, but she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine!
Now she's walkin' in the morning
Howlin' you come home
I'll be on my way, so long, forlorn
You just can't go

I will get it if I have to
If I have to please come home
Try, but I'll be dry, and I crave you
If I haunt you back all day

Carry my trouble
Yes you satisfy my mind
I'll try to tell you, if I can't come in
And I must stay true

I'll be happy in the morning
I try my best, I will try to help you
If I can, and I leave it too
But I just can't find you away
Won't some time away
That's the way I think she told mee 

[??]
Heart she bent on me 

[??]
I'll be out all morning, for you
But you can't stop me

Yes, I try my best to please you
Try my best, but if I fail
You must help me to see you
As I go by...

Dylan: No, it's twice as slow. Twice as slow. It's too fast
Yeah, but it can go in there, man, but it's just gonna be twice as slow as that
I'll fit the words in, same words, but it's gonna be twice as slow. Play every chord about twice as slow
Dylan: OK. let's try it again

Now, if you send me a letter
I'll be on my way to get it for you
I'll be with my sister too
I can't find me what to do

Yes, I've been trying to get a message
To you, but you have to treat me
I won't let her to
And then I try my best to hunt her, you..
Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping everyday and the cotton is high
Your dad is so rich babe and your mama mighty good looking yeah, yeah
So hush little baby, yeah and don’t you, no, no, no, no
Please, please don't cry

One of these mornings we're gonna get up, oh yeah
We're gonna rise up singing, yeah
We’ll spread our wings baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we’ll take to the sky again

But there ain't nothing, nowhere, no, no

Bleeds like a craze, Dad

Easy come, come, gotta back
In the valley of the dead man walks
How they drank from the jazz

Astral, Kestrel
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pedestal
Carving you will never get
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong
Domino on the side

Street light, looking right
Looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache

Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine

Blee-eed, bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Living on a movie
All the Shirley/Charley films on film
Come together, party
Footnote on the footstone

Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Bleed like a craze, Dad

To catch me doing wrong

'Cause we got a thing going on

(Good thing)
Gonna mess up a good thing

You don't know what you're hitting
(Good thing)
Gonna mess up a good thing
(Good thing)
No no no no no

[Verse 1]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Summer flies and August dies
The world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
On black infested trees
The singing man is at his song
The holy on their knees
The reckless are out wrecking
The timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
Than anyone can see anyone can see

[Verse 2]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days besides
When phantom ships with phantom sails
Set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
On bright unfocused eyes
The blue of yet another day
A springtime wet with sighs
A hopeful candle lingers
In the land of lullabies
Where headless horsemen vanish
With wild and lonely cries lonely cries

[Verse 3]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days I know
When all we ever wanted
Was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
We told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
On promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know

[Verse 4]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
Still tender, young and green
Left on shelves collecting dust
Not knowing what they mean
Valentines of flesh and blood
As soft as velveteen
Hoping love would not forsake
The days that lie between lie between
Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here and we're gone

Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark

What - though love is old
What - though song is old
Through them we can be young

Hear this heart of mine
Wailin' all the time
Dear one, tell me that we're one

Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark, dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
Taunting from the hill tops, just out of reach
Smiling pretty smiles, telling your white lies
Stringing me along on your sweet promises
Humi you sure know how to Tantalize

You give yourself to those who don't deserve you
You go where you are not supposed to be
I know someday that I am going to have you
Someday you'll have to give yourself to me

Amandla, Amandla dancin in the distance, sayin I'll be free
Amandla, Amandla it's time to change your partner
It's time to dance with me
Amandla, Amandla you're hanging with the wrong crowd
You need a change of scene
Amandla, Amandla don't lose all your self-respect
You know just what I mean

Standin on Commissioner street, in the pouring rain
Tappin my toe, tappin my toe
This time I was so sure that you would be here
But once again you decided not to show
Amandla, Amandla dancin in the distance, sayin I'll be free
Amandla, Amandla it's time to change your partner
It's time to dance with me
Amandla, Amandla you're hanging with the wrong crowd
You need a change of scene
Amandla, Amandla don't lose all your self-respect
You know just what I mean

You're running with the fools
You know Im more your style
Driving me crazy with that someday smile

Amandla, Amandla dancin in the distance, sayin I'll be free
Amandla, Amandla it's time to change your partner
It's time to dance with me
Amandla, Amandla you're hanging with the wrong crowd
You need a change of scene
Amandla, Amandla don't lose all your self-respect
You know just what I mean

You're hanging with the wrong crowd
You need a change of scene
Don't you lose your self-respect
You know just what I mean

Amandla
Amandla
Amandla
Amandla
Amandla
Amandla
Amandla
Amandla
Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue
Seems like everything has gone wrong
Baby 'cause I'm without you
I guess this is that awful feeling
Baby that feeling they call the blues

All by myself baby, yes I began to weep
Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby
You know I still can't sleep
Yes, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling they call the blues

Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman
I can see you all over the place

Yes, then I start walkin', woman
Start walkin' all over the floor
Yes, my heart is telling me, woman
Tellin' me you won't be here no more
Oh, I guess this is the feeling
Baby the feeling, the feeling they call the blues
Well they were all impressed with your Halston dress
Yes people that you knew at Elaine's
Well the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained

Well you had to be a big shot, didn't you
Had to turn the party out
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
Always got the piece of crowd

You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night, whoa

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the stories of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained

Well I'm not sure what you said last night
No I'm not sure that you want to know
Well here's one hint honey
You sure did put on a show
Well you had to be a big shot, didn't you
Had to go and please the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
Always turned the party out
Had to have the front page, last night
Just to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
Had to have the front page, last night Oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I
I stand accused
Of loving you just a little too much
And I hope, oh Lord
Sure enough hope it's not a crime
Oh, guilty of loving you
Oh, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I
I hope that I
That I never, never, never have to testify
But if I do, if I do, everyone's gonna cry, baby
That boy is guilty, oh Lord
Of loving you

[Bridge]
Although, you belong to another
Another boy, baby
And I may not stand the ghost of a chance
But I'll tell the world
Y'all, I love her, I need her, baby
And I'm a victim of circumstance
And been proven guilty
Oh, yes, I am, yes I am

[Verse 3]
Did you know?
One touch
Lord, lord, lord, of your hand, baby
And I find myself
Right back, right back on the witness stand, darling
Shouting out, shouting out, shouting out
All over the land
I'm guilty
I'm guilty

[Outro]
Oh, Lord, lord, lord
Baby
Oh, please, mama
Please, please
There's no one to guide you
Anyone can feel like this
There's no one beside you
I put a kiss upon your lips
Our love might let you down
But I want you to remember this

No one outshines you
Anyone could feel like this
There's no one inside you
You're the one that I still miss
Our love could let you down
Remember that you told me this

When the fog has twisted
And all the sands have drifted
There is one thing to remember
You're not gone

If you're feeling older
The weight will lift from your shoulders
There is one thing to remember
I'm not gone
I'm gonna find you
Put a kiss upon your lips
No one outshines you
And I want you to remember this
Love won't let you down
If you can remember this

When the fog has twisted
And all the sands have lifted
There'll be one thing to remember
I'm not gone

When you're getting older
The weight will lift from your shoulders
There'll be one thing to remember
You're not gone

I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down

I'm gonna find you
I want you wrapped around my hips
Love will let you down
There's one thing to remember
When the fog is twisted
And all the sands have drifted
There is one thing to remember
You're not gone

When you're getting older
And the weight will lift from your shoulders
There's one thing to remember
I'm not gone

I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down
I promise

I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down
I promise

I won't ever let you down
I promise

I won't ever let you down

[Intro: Michael Jackson & Female]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

[Verse: Michael Jackson]
I never knew but I was walking the line (Hee)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee hee)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee)
My baby cried, she left me standing alone (Hee hee)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee hee)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee hee) (Doggone)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Post-Chorus: Female & Michael Jackson]
Just open the door, and you will see (Hee hee, ooh)
This passion burns inside of me (Ooh, hoo)
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell
Keep it in the closet

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Hoo
Hoo
Hoo
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
You don't, you don't, don't
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo
In the evening baby, when the sun goes down
In the evening, when the sun goes down
Sure get lonesome when your baby's not around, mmm
Sure gets lonesome, sleepin' all by yourself
Sure gets lonesome baby, sleepin' all by yourself
When your lovin' somebody else, she's sleepin' with somebody else, when the sun goes down
In the evenin', when the sun goes down, oooh lord
In the evenin', when the sun goes down
Sure gets lonesome when your baby's not around, when the sun goes down
In the evenin', in the evenin', mama when the sun goes down
In the evenin', mama when the sun goes down
Sure gets lonesome when your baby's not around, when the sun goes down
Yeah!

Chorus:
You remind me of my favorite girl
Who loves to party and it's... Girl
And when she's tipsy she... Girl
And I just wanna know if you're just like her

Chorus:
And so let's get trouble

Call on her when I'm in need
She said just ask charlie sheen
I watched her croll up on her knee
She had me begging pretty please
No my... She follows
But this time I stay down beneath

[2 x Chorus:]
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, yes, winter's coming on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Poppa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home, no, Johnny can't come home
Poppa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home
'Cause he's been on the chain gang too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, yes, winter's coming on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
People come and people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by
Seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember

Never been one to give my heart up so easily
But now you're gone wish I'd given my heart completely
In the touch of a stranger I can feel you
In the eyes of a child I see your face
Your hold on my soul
Keeps me from danger
No matter how hard I try
These memories I can't erase

People come and people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by
Seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember
In the brush of a stranger I can feel you
In the eyes of a child I see your face
Your hold on my soul
Keeps me from danger
No matter how hard I try
These memories I can't replace
Oh, Oh Claudette
Oh, Oh Claudette

I got a brand new baby and I feel so good
She loves me better than I thought she would
I'm on my way to her house and I'm all out of breath
And when I see her tonight I'm gonna squeeze her to death

Claudette
Pretty little pet, Claudette
Never let me fret, Claudette
Well she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get, from Claudette
Oh, oh Claudette

Well I'm a lucky man - my baby treats me right
She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight
When the date is over and I'm at her front door
And when I kiss her goodnight I holler more, more, more

Claudette
Pretty little pet, Claudette
Never let me fret, Claudette
Well she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get, from Claudette
Oh, oh Claudette
When me and my new baby have a date or three
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life
When my brand new baby is my brand new wife

Claudette
Pretty little pet, Claudette
Never let me fret, Claudette
Well she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get, from Claudette
Oh, oh Claudette
Mmm, mmm Claudette
Oh, oh Claudette
Mmm, mmm Claudette

[Verse 1]
What do I got to do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to make you care?
What do I got to do when lighting strikes me?
And to wake to find that you're not there?

[Verse 2]
What do I got to do to make you want me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
And what do I say when it's all over, babe?
And "sorry" seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad, so sad
It's a sad situation
And it's getting more and more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over, babe?
Whoa, it seems to me
That "sorry" seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad, so sad
It's a sad situation
And it's getting more and more and more absurd
Yes, it is
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over, babe?
Whoa, it seems to me
That "sorry" seems to be the hardest word

[Verse 3]
What do I got to do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to make you care? Yeah
And what do I do when lighting strikes me?
What do I got to do, what do I got to do
When "sorry" seems to be the hardest word?

[Chorus]
Feels like the world, yeah
Is closing in on me
Feels like the world
Closing in on me

[Verse 1]
Helplessly I stand (I stand)
Watching love walk away (Away)
Nothing I can do (Do)
Nothing I can say (Say)

[Chorus]
Feels, feels, feels like the world
Closing in on me
Oh, it feels like the world
Closing in on, closing on me now

[Verse 2]
I'm in bad shape (Bad shape)
Since you been gone girl (Gone)
I stare (<>I stare)
I stare out the window
Cry all night long (Long)

[Outro]
Oh, it feels like the world
Closing, closing in on, closing in on me
Feels, it feels like the world
Is closing, closing in on me
Woo, feels like the world
Closing, closing
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Beauty roams to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me
To feel the things you never show?
Tell me why can't I be there where you are
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Root, natty, roots

The only thing that 'll move me now is a fast song
Song long and barely known (?)
And I don't wanna hear no crying all gone wrong song
Kick it off and let's all pick a fast song
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome (?) tune
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on
I'll come in on my part on a fast song
Dideldiedie.....
Well it don't have to have a banjo or mandelin
But let it in, if it wants in
Keep the rosin' handed and the horse there tough and tight
Pick it up and I'm lyable (?) to pick all night
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome (?) tune
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on
I'll come in on my part on a fast song
Repeat last verse, but a little faster

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight, uh-huh
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away, oh, oh, yes

[Bridge]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

[Verse 2]
So, through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have a wonderful, wonderful merry little Christmas now, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah

[Bridge]
'Tis the season to be jolly
Have a merry Christmas now
So, here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more

[Outro]
So through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
So, have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Get the tree, get the holly
Get the tinsel, get the garland
And have a very merry, merry Christmas now
Oh, oh yeah
Have the relatives bring over something good to eat
Have your best girlfriend make something sweet
Have yourself a merry Christmas
'Cause I sure will have me one
Me and my family, me and my hubby, and our new little one
Have yourself a merry Christmas
One... two...
Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
I feel my time... my time has come
Let me in... unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head... inside your hands
I need someone... who understands
I need someone... someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom Come
Until my day... my day is done
And say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
In your tears... and in your blood
In your fire... and in your flood
I hear you laugh... I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

For you I'd wait... 'til kingdom come
Until my days... my days are done
Say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief?
Oh Lord please won't you tell me
Why must I be the thief

Why must I be the thief
He said to the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
That's better off, and always stares

Why must I be the thief
He asked of the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
Who gives me an open hand
Why must I be the thief
He cursed and then he cried
And the hanging man held out his hand
And looked beyond the sky

The thief that climbed the cross
"We should have shared that other's fate."
But the Jesus man said "Not now"
"My brother, not now, it's far too late!"
(far too late) (7x)
Do what you must
Take what you can
Steal the pride from every heart
Every angered man (3x)
I am the thief
I am the thief
And you will run
Yes and you will hide
But I'll get you then
Yes I will
Because of you, because it's justified
I will get you yet
Cause it's justified
I will get you yet
It's justified
I will get you yet
It's justified
Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat much faster
What did I long for, I never really knew
Finding your love, I found my adventure
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights the star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Whenever it's early twilight
I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze, caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear, a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you
I got a whole lot of lovin'
Baby just waiting for you
I got a whole lot of lovin'
Baby just waiting for you
And the way I could love you woman
Honey I know you could love me too

Oh you're so good lookin' baby
And you build up from the ground
Well you're so good lookin' baby

And you build up from the ground
Every time I see you baby
My love starts tumbling down

Yeah, you're just my type baby
Just my height and size
Said you're just my type baby
You're just my height and size
And the reason I love you
Because you've got those little dreamy eyes
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?

Gosh all get-up
How'd you get so lit up?
Gosh all get up
How'd it get that size?

Golly gee
When you turn those heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes?
Mmm, golly gee
When you turn those heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes?
How did they get that size?
Where'd you get those eyes?
I must confess what you say is true
I had a rendez-vous with somebody new
(But) That's the only one I ever had
Baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad

Cheatin' shows and it never goes
You've got a reason to be mad I suppose
But she only was a passing fad
Baby, don'cha be mad

Her kind's a dime a dozen
And that's not the kind I want (I should have past her by)
Who'd ever dream your cousin
Would wander in to that restaurant (Would come along and give us the eye)

I understand that you feel (you're quite) upset
What do you say that you forgive and forget
Come on and kiss me just to show your glad
Baby, baby (baby, baby.....) don'cha go 'way mad
(Now don'cha go 'way mad)
Night and you and blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Lovely you and blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness, there should be love

Come with me while the moon is on the sea
The night is young and so are we

Dreams come true in blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you

[Intro]
Get on down
Get on down
Get on down
Get on down
Get on down
Get on down
Get on down

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
When I walk in the club
The people show me love
They say, "What's up?"
I say, "What's up?"
We say, "What's up, what's up?"
I get looks from the ladies
Daps from the dudes
I'm dressed like it's the 80's
No lenses, checkered shoes
I got a drink in my hand
You know my favorite one
Its red bull and vodka
And nigga, I'm faded, son
And then I get those call
From my favorite hizzo
She screaming "Where the fuck you at?"
Baby girl, I'm at the disco

[Chorus: Redfoo]
I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all I want
So come back, stop messing with my head

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
She was my summer love
Then it got serious
She moved back to her momma's
And got delirious
She went back with her ex
Kept me a secret
Then gets mad at me
When I go to the club and freak it
Aw, naw, baby girl
What you talkin' 'bout
I'm dancing with her bud
You got his dick in your mouth
I ain't no side dish
I'm the main course
I ain't your side bitch
Better decide bitch
Before I find another
I'm a say this one more time
Before good-bye my lover

[Chorus: Redfoo]
I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
And I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all I want
So come back, stop messing with my head
I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
And I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all I want
So come back, stop messing with my head

[Bridge: Redfoo]
Eh, uh oh, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Sky Blu

[Verse 3: Sky Blu]
I got this girl (Girl)
She be my baby (Baby)
She is my world (World)
And drives me crazy (Hey!)
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I feel like you're trying to take control of me
I'm a man, but I can't glance at these
I can't grow my trees, I can't smoke my weed
Hey
That's how I roll
To the show then off to the club I go
You act like I'm trying to wedding band the hoe
Girl, I'm trying to superman the ho
I do like I do baby, that's how I do, baby
Me and my nigga RedFoo, baby
She said, "You crazy"

[Chorus: Redfoo & Sky Blu]
'Cause I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all want
So come back, stop messing with my head
'Cause I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all want
So come back stop messing with my head
'Cause I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all want
So come back stop messing with my head

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you one last time, all I need
Don't want no fussin', don't want no cryin'
You're everything to me

[Chorus]
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
Let me say y'all
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need

[Verse 2]
Once over and again for the last time
Something very wonderful is on my mind
Can I say it twice?

[Chorus]
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need

[Bridge]
We can work it out with no delay
We don't have to fight nor take all day
Hear me now, hear what I say
Hear my plea because, hey, you're

[Outro]
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
(I don't need nobody else)
All I need, all I need, all I need, all I need
(Hey hey, somebody, hey)
All I need, all I need, all I need
(Sugar in my coffee, my cup of tea, hey hey)
All I need, all I need, all I need
(Sweeter than honey, all I need, hey hey, one more time)
All I need, all I need, all I need
Sticky summer weather always pains me
It's like living beneath a blanket I can't breathe
The days are like an oven the nights forever
Nothing to do not much else to see

Then again, I can't stand the thought of winter
Ain't got a fire there's nobody to keep me warm
The night is grey and my coffee tastes so bitter
My memories go raging back to storm

Seems like twenty years ago in the springtime
The rain was sweet the wind was cool and clean
I had a girl she was a lady I could talk to
Now it's almost like she's never been

I've been a long time looking for rainbows
Trying to find a way to believe tomorrow

There was a time I think when I remember dreaming
There was a reason I can't find it now
As I recall it almost made my life worth living
It must be hiding like the sun behind a cloud
I've been a long time looking for rainbows
Trying to find a way to believe tomorrow

Sticky summer weather always pains me
It's like living beneath a blanket I can't breathe
The days are like an oven the nights forever
Nothing to do not much else to see
Like spending a long time looking for rainbows
Oh, oh my darling
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say

There are songs from wisdom
There are songs from satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'

There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane

Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side
Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, lookin' good
Dance, baby, to the light

Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing

Songs we're meant to listen to
You're checkin' out the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test

Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed

Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesize a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster

The Devil have his special plan
To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners
Ay, did you know
Some songs can corrupt your flesh to dust
The only song you should live
Are songs that you can trust
The artist pays the price
When she left the room
Her perfume filled the air
Thirty years gone
It's still there

How I love to breathe
The air she left behind
This trick of fortune
Fills my mind

Simple pleasures
Silver treasures
Take me far, far away...

Faded roses on
A table set for two
An open window
Shares my view

Out among the fields
Breezes dance and play
Tender mercies
Soothe my day
Simple pleasures
Silver treasures
Take me far, far away...
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go

But don't you...
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place

Well, do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you...
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, you can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar

Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, go, go

But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
Going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
Well, I'm going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
You know the hound dog make a music
On a summer night underneath the moon

Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
When the hound dog start barkin'
Sound like ol' Son House singin' the blues

Hound dog sing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
When the hound dog starts singin'
I ain't got them big ol' city blues

Wa-ooo
Wa-ooo oo-oo-ooo
Go ahead pretty mama
Lord, just take that city hike
Said, go ahead pretty mama
Lord, just take your city hike
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dog
For the rest of my natural born life
That's right

Singing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dog
For the rest of my natural born life
Well, I'd wanna live with the hound dog
For the rest of my natural born life

[Verse 1]
Out in the barnyard, the chickens do their number
Out in the farmyard, the cook is choppin' lumber

[Verse 2]
Jump in the pigpen, next time I'll take my shoes off
Hit the dirt, do a two-and-a-half, next time I'll leave my hat on
We're fussing and fighting
I keep on trying
To mend this but you won't
Meet me half way
You say it's over
But I want you closer
What have I got to do
Just say the words

We're being crazy
We're acting so lazy
Let's put in the time
And we'll go back to
Us against the universe It'll be you and me
Us against the universe It'll be you and me

If you need
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
You are oh, oh, oh
You are oh, oh, oh
You are, you are
You're my addiction
Caught in a moment
Where I keep on hoping
Soon you'll come 'round
And see my point of view
Won't ask no questions
I'm craving your presence
There's no prescription
To get me over you
Been thinking lately
You'll say yes not maybe
Just speak the words
And we'll go back to
Us against the universe It'll be you and me

If you need
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
I'll say it's not you, it's me
I'll do all that I can
If I can make you love me again
You are oh, oh, oh
You are oh, oh, oh
You are, you are
You're my addiction
We're fussing and fighting
I keep on trying
To mend this but you won't meet me half way
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and-a groovin' gonna
Satisfy my soul

Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send 'im to the store let's
By some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear
I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of a room

Honky-tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
So bring 'im in and fill 'im up
And send 'im ( ? )
We're gonna have
A party
Tonight yeah whoah whoah
Violent skies
10 am
Falling on my knees again

Outside in the underground
Proud in the rain

I'm walking a straight line
Stepped on all of the cracks this time
I don't care I'm not moving aside
For anyone

Outside in the underground
Proud in the rain
Outside in the underground
There's no way out of here today

I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home
But I've stopped searching
Cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh I've got a hundred lives
Oh I've got to get it right
Oh who knows someday I might
Outside in the underground

Underground
Proud in the rain
Outside in the underground
There's no way out of here today

I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home but I stopped searching
Cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me

Oh I've got a hundred lives
Oh I got to get it right
Oh who knows someday I might
Oh I've got to get it right

[Intro]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Verse 1]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you

[Verse 2]
You can call me 'Professor'
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
You were late to school
Teach you, teach you, teach you
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's cause youre hiding WMDs
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You've been a bad girl

[Outro]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?
Alright

I used to think that you were down, yeah, yeah
I used to think that you were down
Oh, but when times got rough I saw the truth
I thought I found a design of love that could be real life, yeah
But our hearts drifted apart
They no longer bind, yeah yeah
Nothing's alright, you're out of my mind, yeah yeah yeah

And that's the way it's gonna stay
'cause I love a woman in this town
Marrying her today ..
Don't pick my apples
Don't pick my peaches
Leave my tree alone

This is not my money
This is not my car
This is not my world too
What labels me a star?

This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me
This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me

Can't a man have secrets?
Can't a man have love?
Can't a man have an attitude?
Or is it all or none?
I don't know what you want

This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me
This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me
Watch me dance

This is not my woman
This is not her race
Color shouldn't matter
If your soul is in the right place, right place, ooh

This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me
This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me

Yo, Robin Power's on the mic now

Pumpin' a steady jam, but this ain't a battle
N.P.G. is in the house to rattle your brain to the new idea
Love's the only drug we're doin' here
Love's the only drug we're doin' here
We doin' it hard! (Hard!)
N.P.G. is in the house and we're just gettin' started (In the house, yeah)
And on the way, I'll preview all the days to come (Mm-hmm)
We got a big bad drummer who got computers on the run, oh yes it is
Got computers on the run
N.P.G. in the house (N.P.G. in the house)
N.P.G. in the house (N.P.G. in the house)

Plant some peace flowers in your war zone
So I can fire my bodyguards

This is my tree

(This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me
This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let you climb me)

Yo, Robin Power's on the mic now
And I'm comin' from a positive place
Uptown James, let's get ready to turn this papa out

You got to slow this down
Did you hear me? (This is.. this is..)
Yo, yo, slow it down (This is.. this is..)

Yeah
Ways of doing and work
Definition of truth
Sexual regulations
Language allowed/forbidden
With enthusiasm dying
For your country
The imaginary, is bounding reality
There's no need to pretend
We don't know when we do
Individuality, apart from society
Is a big fallacy
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Like just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be queen?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth

For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
The fame won't change us if we don't let it

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Mary won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Ruled the world
Ruled the world

You remind me of my coupe, I wanna ride
Something like my gun, I wanna talk to you, baby

And this my testimony, I wanna be alone with you
You are so phenomenal, I wish I had a corner you
Pictures all in my phone of you, let me park in your garage
When I crank that thing up, you got my back like a massage
And like a Dodge I charge, my bills are larger, my assets, too, salute

[Verse 1]
In 1492 you came upon these shores
Seven hundred years, educated by the Moors
17th Century: genocide and the gun
Middle Passage blessed to market the Africans

[Chorus]
In the so-called "Lands of God"
My kind were treated hard
From back then until now
I see, and you agree
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
Just see my family tree
We have been a misrepresented people
We have been a misrepresented people

[Verse 2]
19th century: slavery destroyed
Soldiers who fought and won
What's known as "nigga boys"
20th century: with freedom in my hand
We invent ideas
Which helped us save a land

[Chorus]
But while I prayed to God
My moms and pops got whored
From back then until now
You'll see our history
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
Just see my family tree
We have been a misrepresented people
Yes, we have been a misrepresented people

[Bridge]
1969: Black power's at the door
1982: Hip-hop was on the floor
1992: Gangsta crack prevailed
1999: Our colors filled the jails

It's through the grace of God
That we all were not scarred

[Outro]
From back then until now
We see no comedy
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
Were we still a mystery
We have been a misrepresented people
Yes, we have been a misrepresented people
Though we march across time
A sea of victories
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
You know we made you grow
We have been a misrepresented people
We have been a misrepresented people
From back then until now
We see our destiny
To never be a misrepresented people
Yes, we march across to time to free
A melody
To never be a misrepresented people
No, you must never be a misrepresented people
There's a land that I have heard about

So far across the sea (repeat)

To have you all, my dreamland

Would be like heaven to me (repeat)

We'll get our breakfast from the tree

We'll get our honey from the bees

We'll take a ride on the waterfalls

And all the glories, we'll have them all

And we'll live together on that dreamland

And have so much fun (repeat)

Oh, what a time that will be
Oh yes, we'll wait, wait, wait and see

We'll count the stars up in the sky...

...And surely we'll never die

[Verse 1]
I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here lookin' at you

[Chorus]
Let me tell ya that it
Hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)
It makes me feel so sad (Feel so sad)
Oh, it hurts so bad to see you again

[Verse 2]
Like needles and pins
People say
You're makin' out okay
He's in love
Don't get in their way

[Chorus]
Well, let me tell ya that it
Hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)
It makes me feel so sad (Feel so sad)
You're gonna hurt so bad
If you walk away

[Bridge]
Why can't you stay
And let me make it up to you?
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before, come love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go, please don't go

[Chorus]
(Hurt, hurts so bad)
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad (Hurts so bad)
If you walk away
Please don't go, please don't go, oh oh
Don't make it hurt so bad
It's gonna hurt so bad to see you again

[Harmonizing]
You give me that funny feeling in my tummy

Oh shit, yeah, that's right

Not me, no mo'
Wanna holla at a latin broad (Come see me!)
And if you try'na get that money, buddy (Come see me!)

Verse 1

Ya'll can play, thugs and gangstas while I
Get this money with these lords and bankers
I was, watching Scarface dreaming of becoming Tony
Schemin, Triple beamin, double teamin bitches with my homies
I got no blame its just some bitches understand my story
And anger problems, my brother, Uly won't hear before me
Rap had me, wanting to be a dope boy
Now I rap, I stay away from that dope, boy
It's destiny, I was breast fed that coke boy
And when you seem them chicos better call them folks boy
I'm putting ya'll on the game
I'm hearing raps about coke and crack (crack?)
To be honest they all sound the same
Pit is off the chain (chain?)
Yea, That's etched in stone (stone?)
So leave him alone (lone?)
Boy, leave him alone
Pit's reporting live (live!)
From D-A-D-E
Gotta problem buddy?
Come see me!

Hook x2

Fuck whos the baddest a person's status depends on salary
This for them Cuban's losing life over Fidel's mentality
Treat a hater like golf and put a hole in one
I dont carry guns but my dawg's holdin' one
Ya'll boys flip bricks, These boys flip tons
One time Fat Joe, Rest In Peace Big Pun
This how I do it do it
Spit English and Spanish fluent
Then if you dont know I suggest
You pay close attention to it
Pit's here now
This how it's going down
Kilos and pounds
Goin town to town
Fortunately thats not my life no mo'
If its gotta do with dope
For me its a no go
Pit's one of a kind
Pit's ahead of his time
I'm nowhere near my prime
I'm always on the grind
I'm reporting live
From D-A-D-E
Gotta problem buddy?

Almost EST. in the 90's

Don't even try is the way God made me
Uh uh,its's the way GOD made me(2x)

Verse 1
Hey hater man, you lookin' down on a greater man
'Kuz with cheese I'm grating quicker, and G's don't stand for gangsta grip
It means more than what ya averaging
I probably average more ice then alaska's skin
Think fast 'kuz the jab is quick, 24 hours my star power 100%
My tolerance like 'enuff of this
Who is this kid think he is?
Notorious like I'm close to big
You ain't notice that my focus like pac I'm above the rim,but more potent than that whole script
I've written' most of my career since 12
Did i mention it 5 year later i be rich from it?
Now lets timeline '89- where everyone was supafly,kingpin or the nearest guy
I was compton hospitalized, in the streets another victim but different in my mother eyes
Wait, don't cut the chimes
I need more relief than 357 mili G's, gotta cold flow i need a pharamacy
Honestly, I am one of the youngest old souls on the scene
If agreed than future teens vote for me
This election,make my selection, by the most lyrically
Holding grudes was never me, my budget won't allow the beef
Don't act your age act your salary
They hatin' me and the horse I rode in on
But have they ever seen they name explode in Neon's
No
You wasn't talkin' 'bout me, must've been talkin' ;bout that pony
'Kuz they say Tyga so great like Tony
Frosted Flakes in the roley, oh he started off with the ice motion
Before the deat I had a gliss like wrist and mo shit
The only true story, VIP's Lil' Homey
Step in and get to know me

Almost EST. in the 90's
But im still a 80's baby
Don't even try is the way God made me
Uh uh,its's the way GOD made me(4x)

[Verse 1]
All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No, I'd rather have nothing at all

[Verse 3]
But please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

[Verse 4]
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all

[Verse 1: Al Jardine]
Well, since she put me down
I've been out doin' in my head
I come in late at night
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed

[Pre-Chorus: Al Jardine, Group]
Well, Ronda, you look so fine (Look so fine)
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me, Ronda
Help me get her out of my heart

[Chorus: Group, Al Jardine]
Help me, Ronda, help, help me, Ronda
Help me, Ronda, help, help me, Ronda
Help me, Ronda, help, help me, Ronda
Help me, Ronda, help, help me, Ronda
Help me, Ronda, help, help me, Ronda
Help me, Ronda, help, help me, Ronda
Help me, Ronda, yeah
Get her out of my heart

[Verse 2: Al Jardine]
She was gonna be my wife
And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it ruined our plans

[Pre-Chorus: Al Jardine, Group]
Well, Ronda, you caught my eye (Caught my eye)
And I give you lotsa reasons why
You gotta help me, Ronda
Help me get her out of my heart

Not so long ago you were my lover, not so many moons ago
How green was my love, how brave and tender, I was much too young to know
Half so long ago I trembled when we kissed and my heart set a song Amen
You may never know, never discover, how I loved you not so long ago
Ooh baby, baby you don't move no more
Oo-wee baby, you don't move no more
I believe, baby I believe I'm gonna let you go

Lord, early in the mornin', baby
You don't wash my face like you used to do
Well, early in the mornin', baby
You don't wash my face like you used to do
Well, you know baby, baby you know that'll never do

Oh, if I should cry, baby would that do poor B. any good?
Well, if I should cry darlin', honey, would it do poor B. any good?
Well, I hate for all my people to know baby
I'm the biggest fool in the neighborhood

Mom and dad are goin' out for the evening
And you're stuck inside the house all alone
That's when you decide it might be fun to harass someone
Dial a random number up on your telephone

You ask if their refrigerator is running
Then you tell 'em they should go out and catch it
Buddy, if they ever figured out where you were callin' 'em from
They'd come and bust your head right in with a ratchet
Listen to me

Don't go makin' phony calls
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to
I know that you think it's funny driving folks right up the wall
But it's really getting old fast

Little Melvin has a natural obsession
Asking for Prince Albert in a can
He gets a kick each time he makes a collect call
To some guy he doesn't know who lives in Japan
He's calling strangers up at three in the morning
Gives 'em pizza pie delivery at four
He won't be laughin' when they're tracin' his line
One day the phone police will be there at his door
Yo, hear me

Don't go makin' phony calls
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to
Swear someday I'm gonna yank that phone
Cord right out from the wall
How long is this phase gonna last?
Come on

Uh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name Rotch

[MOE, spoken]
Hold on, I'll check
My crotch! My crotch! Hey, has anybody seen my crotch lately?
Listen to me, you little puke
One of these days, I'm gonna catch you
And I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an icepick

[WEIRD AL]
Don't go makin' phony calls
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to
You went through the New York City phone book
And prank-called 'em all
Hope that you grow out of this fast
Grow out of this fast
Don't go makin' phony calls
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to
But you think it's funny when you're drivin' folks right up the wall
But you're just a pain in the ...

Whether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I am growing fonder of you

Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find, you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
Much more than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But baby I can't live without it

Oh how I'd cry, oh how I'd cry
If you got tired, and said good-bye
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know
She may not be the best lookin' woman
I ever did see
Nor have the charms of the ladies
Of high society

But the woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And all the love that I have belongs
To the woman with soul

Now I'm just a regular fellow
I don't need much
I don't need a Cadillac car
Or diamonds and such

But the woman that I hold
She's got to have soul
And then I'm richer than the richest gold
If the woman's got soul

I don't need a woman
That's got a whole lot of class
Because class in a woman
Don't mean she's gonna last
I need a kind of lady
That when I hold she fits up tight
And when she throws it on me
I give in without a fight
Then I know the woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And all the love that I have belongs
To the woman with soul
The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul

The woman's got soul
Worth all money and gold
And all the love that I have belongs
To the woman with soul
The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul

The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul

The woman's got soul
The woman's got soul

The woman's got soul
Yes I've been dreaming about you every day
Each and every day
Had I been thinking about you all night long
I even wrote a song

Just to try to tell you how I really feel
To make you understand my love is real
That you're on my mind all the time
I wish to God you were mine once again

I remember talkin' to you
I remember walkin' with you
I remember laughin' all the time
And you were mine
Now the days seem so long
I can't face a night alone
I beg you please won't you please come home

I remember talkin' to you
I remember walkin' with you
I remember laughin' all the time
I remember singin' to you
I remember dreamin' with you
I remember lovin' you alone
And now the days seem so long
I can't face a night all alone
I beg you please won't you please come home
Well now, it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied
I've looked all around me
And my baby, she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby, she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
People, I'm going down to the golden ground
Goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh, goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please, please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins

[Verse 1]
I watch the distant lights on the runway
Disappear into the evening sky
Oh, you know I'm with you on your journey
Never could say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you, I don't want you to

[Chorus]
Break away
Fly across your ocean
Break away
Time has come for you
Break away
Fly across your ocean
Break away
Time has come

[Verse 2]
For you to awaken in another country
Greet the morning under foreign skies
Leaving me to face another Monday
It's not easy to get by

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you, I don't want you to

[Chorus]
Break away
Fly across your ocean
Break away (breakin' away, break away)
Time has come for you
Break away (breakin' away, break away)
Fly across your ocean
Break away (breakin' away, break away)
Time has come for you
Break away
Fly across your ocean
Break away (breakin' away, break away)
Time has come for you
Hey, fellas, yes, you, fellas, listen to me, I got something to tell you
And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves accordingly

Now, you see these girls with these fine diamonds, fine furs and fine clothes
Well, they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who knows
They ain't foolin', and if you fool around with them
You're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'

Listen, if she saves you dough, and won't go to the show
Beware
If she's easy to kiss and won't resist
Beware

And if you go for a walk, and she listens while you talk
She's tryin' to hook you

And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'
Don't do it, don't do it
And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row
Bring her down front, bring her right down front
If you wanna go for a snack, and she wants to sit in the booth in the back
Beware

And listen, if she's used to caviar and fine silk
When you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk
She's trying to get you

If you're used to goin' to Carnegie Hall, but when you take her out night clubing
All she wants is one meatball
You better take it easy

If she grabs your hand and says, "Darling, you're such a nice man"
Beware, I'm telling you

(Should I tell them no more?)
(Tell them everything)

You better listen to me 'cause I'm telling you what's being put down
You better pick up on it

If her sister calls your brother, you better get further
I'm telling you, you better watch it

And if she's acting kind of wild, and she says, "Darling, give me a trial"
Don't you do it, don't be weak, don't give it to her
And if she smiles in your face and just melts into place
Let her melt, forget it, let her melt
(Should I tell them no more?)
(Tell them everything)

Now listen, if she calls you up on the phone, and says
"Darling, are you all alone?"
Tell her, "No, no, I've got two, three women with me"

Don't pay no attention to women
Stand up for your right, be a man, be a man

(Are you listening?)
If you turn out the lights and she don't fight
That's the end, it's too late
She's got you hooked, you might as well stick with her

(Should I tell them no more?)

If you get home about two and don't know what to do
You pull back the curtains, and the whole family's looking at you
Get your business straight
Set the date, don't be late

Brother, beware, beware, beware
Brother, you better beware
The truth about a Roni, she's a sweet little girl
You could treat her nice real and hold her tight
Only tender Roni's, can give a special love
A special kind of love that makes you feel good inside

So, if you believe in love and all that it can do for you
Just give it one chance, girl, you'll find romance
Hold on till you find a tende Roni that is right for you
Make it official, give me your love

Special kind of girl that makes her daddy feel proud
You know, the kind of girl that stands out in crowds
Oh, found a tender Roni and the Roni is so right
Think I'm gonna love her for the rest of my life

[Incomprehensible]

[Verse 1]
If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

[Verse 2]
If'n I was God
I'd fix it so, without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's goin' on inside
Of everyone else like me

[Verse 3]
Nobody hurts, nobody else
Oh no, I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thankin' me

[Verse 4]
If'n I were God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realise
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone
And God, that ain't half what I would do
If'n I were You-oo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-hoooo
Oh yeah!
If'n I were God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand
Oh yeah-eah!

[Verse 1]
Belle
The Lord and I've been friends for a mighty long time
Ooh hoo, Belle
Leaving Him has never ever really crossed my mind
Let me say just one thing
I'd never go so far, mmm
'Cause it's Him no matter who you are, oh hoo
Belle
Oh, it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need

[Verse 2]
I'd like to take a little minute just to say now
Belle
The laughter of the sound has quieted down
Ooh hoo, mmm, Belle
The best thing we could do is have Him around
Now. I'm not playing, little lady, let me say this one thing
I think if love could abound
My heart was lost but now it's found
Ooh hoo, Belle
Oh, let's you and I let His love come down

[Bridge]
I'm so happy, happy about that now, say this
Seems so easy to me
To try to act naturally
Let's not waste each other's time, time, ooh hoo

[Verse 3]
Belle
He's my surprise and, Lord, he's my joy
My joy, not a toy
Belle
I know that you can understand
A little country boy
Just a little country boy
Hey, He brought me safe thus far
Let me say it, little lady
Through many drunken country bars
Ooh hoo, Belle, oh, let me say
He's my bright morning star
Belle, Belle
My bright in the morning
He's my bright in the morning, He's
He's my everything, my everything
Hey, a drink of water
(Belle, Belle)
Belle
He's my joy in the morning time
(Belle, Belle)
Belle
I know you're all of these things, yeah
But, uh, He's such a brighter joy, He's such a brighter
He's, He's, He's
(Little, little, little lady, Belle)
(Jesus is my)
(I just let you know that Jesus)
Little, little, little Belle
(My everything)
My everything
(Everything)
Everything
In the morning
(Time, time)
In the evening
(Time, time)
In the daytime
In the nighttime
(Little lady)
Hey! Hey!
He's my everything, yeah! He's
Belle
Belle, Belle, Belle, Belle, Belle ...
When you were very young, the world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky
Above the ring you loved so well

Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl, you're through
Just sit there and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl, you might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue

[Verse 1]
You say you're gonna leave me for the arms of another
You say my love for you is no good and we can't go any further
But have pity on me
I was blind but now I see
Stay with me and never walk out of my life

[Chorus]
Because
Oh, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin')
Oh, oh, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin', baby)

[Verse 2]
In spite of all the wrong I've done, I'll make it up to you
Even if it takes all my life, I'll prove my love to you
So please don't go away
With me always stay
'Cause I love you and I couldn't stand it being away, girl

[Chorus]
Oh, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin')
Oh, oh, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin', baby)

[Verse 3]
Girl, restore the faith you had in me
I'm beggin' you down on my knees
Please don't take your love from me
Don't leave me, don't leave

[Verse 4]
Forgive this fool for causing your heart to suffer
Remember two wrongs don't make a right, it only makes things tougher
So have little sympathy on a poor fool like me
And stay with me, please don't walk out of my life

[Chorus]
Because
Oh, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin')
Oh, oh, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin', baby)

Oh baby, baby, baby (I need your lovin')
Oh, woo, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin', baby)
Oh oh oh (I need your lovin')
I need your lovin' baby, baby, baby (I need your lovin', baby)
Oh, woo, I need your lovin' (I need your lovin')
I need it, I need it
Goodbye cold
Goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow
And goodbye shame

I'm headin' out west with my headphones on
Boarding a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

I just found out her ghost left town
The Queen of California is a-steppin' down

Hello beauty
Hello strange
Hello wonder
What's your name

Looking for the sun that Neil Young hung
After the gold rush of 1971

I just found out her ghost left town
The Queen of California is a-steppin' down
If you see her
Say hello
Just don't tell me
I told you so

Joni wrote 'Blue' in a house by the sea
I gotta believe there's another color waiting for me
To set me free

I just found out her ghost left town
The Queen of California is a-steppin' down, down, down
Get down

[Intro]
Come on, man, get your bag
We got to go
Man, tell that girl goodbye, let's get out of here
Woo

[Verse 1]
I wanna talk to you (Talk to you, said I wanna talk to you)
'Bout this love affair
Is it really true (Really true, tell me, is it really true?)
That you don't care?
Seems like every day (Every day, seems like every day)
You grow farther away
Tell me, what can I say (What can I say?)
To make you stay? (Make you stay)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you really don't love me anymore
I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
There's a train that's leavin' in the morning
That will take you straight to Santa Fe
If you feel this thing we got just can't go on
Then I won't stand in your way
(I won't stand in your way)
(I won't stand in your way)
No, no

[Verse 2]
I'm so in love with you (I'm so in love with you)
You're all I wanna be (You're all I wanna be)
Whenever you go away, baby (Whenever you go away)
You take a part of me (You take a part of me)
Yes, you do (Yes, you do)
A man's gotta do what he gotta do
But remember, babe, wherever you go
I'm with you (I'm with you)
('Cause I need ya)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you really don't love me anymore
I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
There's a train that's leavin' in the morning
That will take you straight to Santa Fe
If you feel this thing we got just can't go on
Then I won't stand in your way
(I won't stand in your way)
(I won't stand in your way)
No, no
Woo

[Instrumental]
(Man, get your bag)
(Get out of here)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you really don't love me anymore
I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
There's a train that's leavin' in the morning
That will take you straight to Santa Fe (Take you, take you)
If you feel this thing we got just can't go on (Darling, no)
I won't stand in your way
(I won't stand in your way)
(I won't stand in your way)
(I won't stand in your way)
Woo

(Come on, baby)
(Take this with you)

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm goin' crazy, I'm lonely and I need a kiss
My body wants to call you but my ego says I got to resist
Tired of waiting baby, tired of giving you the upper hand
You play it your way, I never know where I stand

[Chorus]
So I said
No call you, you call me
If love is true, I will see

[Verse 2]
I can't to listen to my music for when you're calling, what'll I do
My body wants to call you but my ego says let her call you
Everybody say you got the different kind of live and die
Baby, I don't wanna but I'll listen to my ego tonight

[Chorus]
I said
No call you, you call me
If love is true, I will see, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh
No call you, you call me
You still call, I still call you baby
If love is true, I will see, yeah

[Verse 3]
Girl, I'm goin' crazy, I'm lonely and I need a kiss
My body wants to call you but my ego says I got to resist
Got this lovin' if you want to, but I ain't playin' second to none
You gotta put your arms around me and tell me I'm the only one

[Chorus]
I said
No call you, you call me (no, no, no)
If love is true, I will see
(I will see baby, I will)
No call you, you call me
If love is true, I will see

[Breakdown]
No call you
You call me
Love is true
I will see
No call you (I called you in the summer)
You call me (whenever I call your ass up on the phone)
Love is true (love is true)
I will see (love you)

[Spoken]
Woo!
Damn I wish you'd call me
What possesses you to be so proud
Just tell me that you love me
Write a letter for crying out loud
Just tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus]
No call you, you call me
(Boy, I'm going crazy)
If love is true, I will see
(Can't make up my mind what I wanna do tonight)
No call you, you call me
(I'm kind of lonely and I)
If love is true, I
(I don't know what I)

[Outro]
No that's alright
I'm the coolest
No boy, you got to call me
Yeah
We can fool around if you want to
I won't call you, you gon' have to call me
That's right, I'm stubborn
That's my middle name
Cool day in the summer
If I call your ass up on the phone
No call you, you call me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-wee

Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses
Morning me, evening me
And as the world slips
Far away, star away
Forever me with love

Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire
Pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence
Quietly, whisper me
Forever me with love

Forever me with love
And ev'ry day I'll
Gentle you, tender you
And oh, the way I'll
Velvet you, clover you
I'll wrap you up and
Ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you with shine!
Suddenly, magically
We found each other
There we were, here we are
I plan to let you
Happy me, summer me
Winter me, always be mine!
A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city, yeah
His sister's black but she is sho'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord, her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city
Her brother's smart, he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city, yeah
Just enough for the city
Just enough for the city
Just enough for the city

In my mind I'm goin' to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moonshine
Maybe just like a friend of mine
It hit me from behind
Yes I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind

Karen she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shinin'
Watch her watch the mornin' come
A silver tear appearing now I'm cryin'
Ain't I goin' to Carolina in my mind

There ain't no doubt it no ones mind
That loves the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
And hey babe the sky's on fire, I'm dyin'
Ain't I goin' to Carolina in my mind

In my mind I'm goin' to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moonshine
Maybe just like a friend of mine
It hit me from behind
Yes I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind
Dark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway calling
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
Signs that might be omens say I going, going
I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind

With a holy host of others standing 'round me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it seems like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me
If I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mind

In my mind I'm goin' to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moonshine
Maybe just like a friend of mine
It hit me from behind
Yes I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind
I laughed at sweethearts
I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland
Was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes
Now castles rise in Spain!

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still
Through all my school days
I hated boys
Those April Fool days
Brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato
Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss
I'm reading Missus Glyn!
It feels like summer
I can hear the music playin'
I hear the drummer
I can the children playin'
Snow will fall
The snow will fall
Snowfall

Sounds like laughter
A happy song in the days
What are we after?
I can hear mister say
Someone will call
Someone will call
Someone will call

Ooh

Feels like winter
Oh happy song today
In time, I can hear mister say
Snow will fall
Snow will fall, yea
Yea, the snow will fall
Snow, snow, snow, snow, will fall
Snow, snow, beautiful snow
Wonderful, cold snow
Snow

You are wonderful
Wonderful snow, snow
Beautiful, wonderful
Oh, marvelous snow, snow, yea
Meanwhile think about it
Beautiful clean wonderful snow
“People often ask me about the voices on Dark Side. I was trying to gather audio snippets to mix into segues on Dark Side. Rather than interviewing people I came up with the idea of writing a series of questions on cards. The cards would be in a stack on a conductors stand in front of a mike. We would scour Abbey Road Studios for willing guinea pigs, bring them to the studio, sit them down, roll tape and then ask them to respond to each card in order.

As I recall the first card was something irrelevant and innocuous, like “What’s your favourite colour?” and the last was the more enigmatic “What do you think of The Dark Side Of The Moon?”

I can’t remember the ones in between, except for:
Are you afraid of dying?
When were you last violent?
Were you in the right?
Do you ever think you’re going mad?
If so why?

End of Story.”

[Verse 1]
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over-loved, over me

[Verse 2]
Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over-loved, over me

[Outro]
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know?
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over-loved, over you, you
Over you

Cheyenne, Cheyenne

[Verse 1]
I'm a little unsure how it got so complicated
If I let go I know, I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before, I was sure to break it
I don't know what you did, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

[Chorus]
Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started, baby
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

[Post-Chorus]
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

[Verse 2]
Cheyenne, got the table set for two, guess you couldn't make it
Thought I kissed your lips again, I was dreaming (dreaming)
I still believe that night we shared was something sacred (yeah)
I'm tryna clear my head, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't (can't) stop (stop) thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't (can't) stop now

[Chorus]
Look what we started, baby
You're not what I expected
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun (Cheyenne)
Look what we started, baby (started, baby)
I used to look for exits
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun

[Post-Chorus]
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't stop thinking 'bout you every day
No, I can't stop now

Look what we started, baby (oh, oh, baby)
You're not what I expected (woo)
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun (huh, woo)
Look what we started, baby (started, baby)
I used to look for exits (you, yeah)
'Cause all I ever wanted was some fun (oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove
I never meant to fall in love (Cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in lo-ove

Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot

[Chorus:]
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

[Chorus:]
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead

[Chorus:]
Written by Danny Kirwan

Yes there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day

When somebody leaves you
You just lose a friend
But when you left me babe
Thought it was the end

Because there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day
When somebody leaves you
You just lose a friend
But when you left me babe
Thought it was the end

Because there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Oh when you left me that day
This time

Baby, baby, U just want me 4 the sex

Damn my life, I'd rather spend it all with U

Give me all I need
When I see you, walking around
When I see you, walking around
Baby I need you
Baby I love you
Baby I need you

[Verse 1]
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her, too

[Refrain]
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree

[Verse 2]
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me

[Refrain]
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree

[Bridge]
A love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Have you near me

[Verse 3]
Bright as the stars that shine
Dark as the sky
I said I know, I know this love of mine
Will never die

[Refrain]
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree, yessiree

[Bridge]
Yeah, a love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Have you near me

[Verse 4]
Bright as the stars that shine
As dark as the sky
I said I know, I know this love of mine
Will never die

[Refrain]
'Cause I love her, oh yessiree, yessiree

[Outro]
I love her
Yes, this love of mine will never die
Simply 'cause I love her
I want the world to know that I love her
It's just the same old song and dance, the same old song and dance
Turns out you never cared at all, turns out you bound me like a ball
Whoever thought I'd fall for the same old song and dance
It's just the same old smooth routine, the same old moonlit scene
Turns out you only used those eyes simply to tell me all those lies
I really went king-size for the same old song and dance
Me with a built-in radar, me with a cushion hard
Winding up number one on the all-time loser's card
I should forget you but I won't, should hate you but I don't

It didn't turn out like I planned but if you smile and wave your hand
I'd go out and hire a band, and wait for one more chance
At the same old song and dance
(instrumental)
It didn't turn out just like I planned
But if you smile and wave your lily white hand
I'd go out and hire a band, then wait for one more chance
At the same old, same old song and dance
Follow your dreams don't give up
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure
Follow your dreams don't give up
Remember anything is possible, believe is all you gotta do
Please don't give up
Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do just because they ain't you
Believe in yourself that's enough
The sky is the limit if you want it all you gotta do is get it homie

This is a message to the youth
Remember you can do anything you pursue
Look at me, I'm living proof
It's a piece of me in you, it's not a lot that's different bout us
Nobody ever thought I'd live to see a million dollars
Remember I was hustlin just to fix up my Impala
And now you ought to see the rides I hop up outta
Convertible Mercedes, look at haters like holla
Reclining terra cotta, I don't owe you guys notta
All they get is second hand as I pass by
I'm that fly, so they go hatin I don't ask why
Hey nevermind, keep your head to the sky dog
Remember nothing beats a failure but a try dog
Don't listen to them when they say it can't happen
Let it go in this ear and right out that one
Just keep mashing on them, laughing
Soon you'll be passing all they broke asses
Better than you imagined
Follow your dreams don't give up
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure
Follow your dreams don't give up
Remember anything is possible, believe is all you gotta do
Please don't give up
Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do just because they ain't you
Believe in yourself that's enough

The sky is the limit if you want it all you gotta do is get it homie

Same message on the second, continued from verse one
You let them trick you out of your dreams the worse done
The only purpose for some is to take your eyes off the prize
And to keep you from succeeding see they willing to die
Let's say one day you cross paths end up killing a guy
Never make it, go to the penn now you letting him win
Man now here he is with a big ass grin
Laughing at you from the grave cause you ain't get paid
The same ones that call you a sucka today
Laugh at you tomorrow when the feds take you away
Listen, once upon a time there was a guy name Jay
He will never make managing TI they say
He'd quit right then if they had they way
Instead he quit his job, hustled hard, night and day
Dropped an album on his artist although no one ever heard of him
Minus sales but the mixtapes murdered em
Got on a label, sent the hatas home inspired
Turned Grand Hustle into an empire
And poof, out the hood he blew
If not me Jay Jeter, that could be you
Remember
Follow your dreams don't give up
Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure
Follow your dreams don't give up
Remember anything is possible, believe is all you gotta do
Please don't give up
Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do just because they ain't you
Believe in yourself that's enough
The sky is the limit if you want it all you gotta do is get it homie

[Verse 1]
Well, you say you'll be fine
When you walk out that door
Oh, will it be that easy
To see me no more?

[Chorus]
Well, will you be fine?
Are you complete?
Say you'll survive
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street

[Verse 2]
Well, say you'll be fine
When you walk out that door
Oh, will it be that easy
To see me no more?

[Chorus]
Will you be fine?
Are you complete?
Say you'll survive
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Will you be fine?
Are you complete?
Say you'll survive
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street
Down Endless Street

[Verse]
If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

[Outro]
The birds in May time
Would sing a sad and mournful refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain
With you, with you beside me
The rose would bloom in the snow
With you right here beside me
No winds of winter would blow
I gave you all of my love, all of my love
And I was living a dream
But living would seem in vain, all in vain
If I ever lost you
Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some are gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meanings
When I think of love as something new
I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more
Well, I could have been sick, I could have died
I could have given up and not tried
To make it to tomorrow
Like a broken hearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken
It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor
Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses
And they knew all the places I needed to go
All of the people I needed to know
They knew who I needed, who needed me
And who would come help me and who would just let me be
I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say?
When you're in the hands of angels
Life is, oh, so sweet
And you feel the love down deep inside
Even out there on the street
In the hands of angels
God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!

God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!

And when I close my eyes tonight to symphonies of blinding light
(God bless us, everyone, we're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Oh, like memories in cold decay, transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I, where oceans bleed into the sky

God save us, everyone, will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no!

God save us, everyone, will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no!
And when I close my eyes tonight to symphonies of blinding light
(God bless us, everyone, we're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Oh, like memories in cold decay, transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I, where oceans bleed into the sky

Oh, like memories in cold decay, transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I, where oceans bleed into the sky

Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...
Lift me up... Let me go...

God bless us, everyone (Lift me up)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun (Let me go)
And, it can't be outfought (Lift me up)
It can't be outdone, it can't be outmatched (Let me go)
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us, everyone (Lift me up)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun (Let me go)
And, it can't be outfought (Lift me up)
It can't be outdone, it can't be outmatched (Let me go)
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us, everyone (Lift me up)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun (Let me go)
And, it can't be outfought (Lift me up)
It can't be outdone, it can't be outmatched (Let me go)
It can't be outrun, no!

[Verse 1: Brian]
Maybe it's just me
But I don't think that it is
Possible for me
To continue like this, oh!
I feel so insecure
Every time you walk away
And I'm never really sure
How long you're gonna stay

[Chorus: AJ & All]
Maybe it's all in my head
I feel like leaving but I don't really want to
But I feel so mislead
A kiss through the phone just won't do, no
'Cause from my point of view
I gotta say
There's something 'bout you
So tell me babe
Somewhere down the road (somewhere down the road)
I think you lost it all
Now it's all in my head, all in my head
All in my head, all in my head

[Verse 2: Nick with Howie, Brian]
Mmmmh-yeah!
You know it's not my style
To start a fight and make a scene
But I'm different this time
I am not a drama fiend, no
And maybe it's just me (maybe it's just me)
But this is how I feel (this is how I feel)
And this can't simply be
Another case of jealousy, oh-oh!

[Chorus: AJ & All]
Maybe it's all in my head
I feel like leaving but I don't really want to
But I feel so mislead
A kiss through the phone just won't do, no
'Cause from my point of view
I gotta say
There's something 'bout you
So tell me babe
Somewhere down the road (somewhere down the road)
I think you lost it all
Now it's all in my head, all in my head
All in my head, all in my head

[Bridge: AJ with Brian]
I mean we can talk it out
Pretend that it's all right
But all right just won't do anymore, no
I mean we can kiss and make up
Pretend that it's enough
But enough just won't do anymore, oh-oh!

[Interlude: Howie]
Maybe it's all in my head
I feel like leaving but I don't really want to
But I feel so mislead
A kiss through the phone just won't do

[Chorus: AJ, Brian & All]
Maybe it's all in my head (maybe it's all)
I feel like leaving but I don't really want to (maybe it's all)
But I feel so mislead (I feel so mislead)
A kiss through the phone just won't do, no
'Cause from my point of view
(I gotta say) I gotta say
There's something 'bout you
(There's something about you baby!)
So tell me babe
Somewhere down the road (somewhere down the road)
I think you lost it all
Now it's all in my head, (head) all in my head
(It's all in my head)
All in my head, all in my head (it's all in my head)

[Verse 1]
You're my morning star
Shining brightly beside me
And if we keep this love
It will last through all eternity

[Pre-Chorus]
Just the way we are, our love story
That's just the way it should be

[Chorus]
'Cause our love will stand as tall as the trees
Our love, will spread as wide as the sea
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above
And we'll always be together (Our love)

[Verse 2]
My love is surely one thing
You can surely depend on
In times of darkness and fear
I go to you, i know you'll make me strong

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna make me happy
And you're gonna make me smile

[Chorus]
'Cause our love will stand tall as the trees
Our love will be for the whole world to see

Our love
We got a mighty, mighty
Our love
Hey
Our love
We got a mighty, mighty
Our love
Ooh that's right
Our love

[Outro]
Break it down
Just a little
Because love is soft, love is sweet
Love is nice, love is gentle
Love is joy, love is pain
Love is laughing in the rain
Love is you, love is me
Love is just a little baby
(Our love)
I got love on my mind
Love is always right on time
(Our love)
Love is you, love is me
Love is gonna set me free
(Baby, baby, our love)
Yeah
(Our love)
Our love
(Baby, baby, our love)
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
(Our love)
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
(Baby, baby, our love)
You got my pride
Hanging out of my bed
You're messin' around with my life
So I bought my ...
You even mess with my children
And you're screamin' at my wife, baby
Get off my back
If you want to get outta here alive

Freedom, give it to me
That's what I want now
Freedom, that's what I need now
Freedom to live
Freedom, so I can give

You got my heart
Speak electric water
You got my soul
Screamin' and howlin'
You know you hook my girlfriend
You know the drugstore man
But I don't need it now
I was trying to slap it out of her head
Freedom, so I can give
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, that's what I need

You don't have to say that you love
If you don't mean it
You'd better believe
If you need me
Or you just want to bleed me
You'd better stickin' your dagger in someone else
So I can leave
Set me free

(Yeah)

Right on, straight ahead
Stay up and straight ahead
Freedom

[Intro]
Hey girl, I don't mean no harm, but
You do something to me
I'm not sure quite what it is yet, but
I'm getting a pretty good read on it at this point
It's gonna come to me
What is it exactly what we do
Oh god, yeah we gotta dance

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance with me, dance
Dance on the floor, dance

[Verse 1]
The club is packed like a sandwich
All types of people like ham and swiss
Lettuce and tomato toasted bread
Bite down and taste the rhythm
Thank goodness we're finally here at the club
Man what a great-looking crop of people
The fact that they worked all week
Really adds to the meaning behind their dancing
My boss yelled at me "Take this dance move
The copier broke down but tonight you're a star!"

[Chorus]
I don't care what your name is
I don't care where you went to college
I hate your outfit and your face
Now everybody dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 2]
Your jam's on, the jimmy jam's on
This is the time to get your jimmy jam on
Hey jimmy, no, it's jimmy jam
Time to slam bam, is it jimmy jam?
World beat, whores in rhythm
Africa, no man's land
South America, fruits and coconuts
Europe, you have no idea
Europe is crazy
Global warming, hot and sexy
Poverty, exotic things

[Chorus]
I don't care who you came with
I don't care if your car just died
I hate your open wounds and your brain
Now everybody dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Everybody dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
For all the times that you've wondered why
The world turned out this way
And all of the times that you've asked yourself
About the games that people play
About the politics of hunger
And the politics of need
How the politics of power
Seem to be the politics of greed

For all of the times that you've struggled in an effort
To work your way back upstream
And all of the times you've held on to it
When most of us had lost the dream
And for all of the ones who have walked with you
By your side or way back home
Maybe much more than any of us
You know that no one is really alone

Because the heart is still a hunter
It's like a beacon in the night
And though the heart is just a lover
It's never afraid to fight
We are fighting for more than survival
We are working for more than peace
We are giving ourselves to each other
Making sure all injustice is will someday cease
You can take a look around you
And you can see how far we've come
All the separate parts
All the hundreds of hearts
That are beating together as one

It's a possibility
For many tomorrows
It's a possibility
Of a world to be made for everyone
It's a possibility
No more suffering and sorrow
It's a possibility
It's in everyone

It's a possibility
For many tomorrows
It's a possibility
Of a world to be made for everyone
It's a possibility
No more suffering and no more sorrow
It's a possibility
It's in everyone

[Chorus]

Somebody dreaming
But you just living
(Moody river, moody river)

(chorus) Moody river, more deadly than the vainest knife
Moody river, your muddy water took my baby's life

Last Saturday evenin' came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found with a note addressed to me
It read "Dear love, I've done you wrong, now I must set you free"
No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend"

(repeat chorus)
I looked into the muddy water and what could I see?
I saw a lonely, lonely face just lookin' back at me
Tears in his eyes and a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love at his fingertips

(repeat chorus)

[Verse 1]
Girl, I've seen you around almost every day
I look you up and down every time you pass my way
Baby, don't you realize what you do to me, yeah
Oh, I'm so hypnotized, I can't hardly see, oh

[Chorus]
If you ever wanna need someone
I forever wanna be the only one in your life
(I need your body) Oh, baby
(I need your body) Oh, darlin'
If you ever wanna need someone
I forever wanna be the only one in your life
(I need your body) Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you're free tonight, I'd love to take you home
You understand that I don't wanna spend the night alone
It would be like paradise makin' love to you, yeah
Well, don't you think it's time I got into you, whoa, oh, oh

[Chorus]
If you ever wanna need someone
I forever wanna be the only one in your life
(I need your body) Yeah, yeah
(I need your body) Oh, darlin'
If you ever wanna need someone
I forever wanna be the only one in your life
(I need your body) Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Why don't you stay with me, I'm livin' in a fantasy, yeah
Oh, tell me what you want, tell what you need
Why don't you stay-stay with me, I'm livin' in a fantasy, yeah
Girl, tell me what you want, tell what you need, oh

[Chorus]
If you ever wanna need someone
I forever wanna be the only one in your life

If you ever wanna need someone
I wanna be in your life
(I need your body) Oh, baby

[Outro]
You know, it's not every day (I need your body)

Come here, baby (I need your body)
Somethin' I want, something I want to say (I need your body) (Oh, darlin')
I think I love you, darlin'

Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth
As it is in Heaven

Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors

And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power and the glory forever

Amen

Now I lay my down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
Guide me safely through the night
And wake me with the morning light
Alright, Westley Funkaneers, today we go to war

Hey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town

Dead or alive..

Its coming from heaven on high
I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward (I've gained a reward)
For the land where we never shall die

The saviour who died, on cruel calvary
He shed his life blood that the world might be free
So follow his footsteps, up the narrow way
And be ready to meet him when calls on that day

The saviour has paid a great price for me

That'll pay my debt on the great judgement day

Love right now, love brother
Love right now, love...
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
And there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I want to stop and thank you, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be
Without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did seems I'd done 'em before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I want to stop and thank you, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and nobody else
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I want to stop and thank you, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Look in your eyes
And I see the lies
But in my mind
It's a mystery
Feeling the pain
And I feel the love
And once again
You're the world to me

Hey, what is this thing I'm feeling, baby
What are these strange emotions
Loving the pleasure sweetly
Loving the pain as deeply

It's almost midnight
And my love is coming down
Lots of ladies love me
But it's still a lonesome town

(Very special love
Very special love affair)
(Very special love
Very special love affair)
You've got me looking for love
Though you're my sole desire
Looking for love and a girl for me
You've got me looking for love
And my soul's on fire
Looking for love and a girl for me

Memories of our love obsesses me
Thoughts of us are sending all the time
If I gave into your soul, my dear
Then you really never could be mine
Very, very loving day
Think of you every day, think of you all kinds of ways

Sometimes I hate your guts
And love your lust
Sometimes I love your guts
And hate your lust

It was a crazy love affair
A crazy love affair
Oh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I hate your lust

[Repeats]
Very special love

I got a good luck charm
Hanging on my arm
To have, to hold
Tonight
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Oh yeah
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Oh yeah

If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say

C'mon and be my little good luck
Charm, uh huh huh
You sweet delight
I got a good luck charm
Hanging on my arm
To have, to hold
Tonight

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Oh yeah

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Oh yeah

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh
Oh yeah
The diamond necklace played

[Two, three, four...]

The diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome mannered baton

A blind class aristocracy
Back through the op'ra glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
Columnated ruins domino!

[Two, three, four...]
Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn

The music hall; a costly bow
The music, all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter's swan
Columnated ruins domino!
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers the hour was-
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-step to lamp light's cellar tune

The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
A glass was raised, a fire roast
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting

While at port adieu or die
A choke of grief heart-hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's up, board a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave

I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song...

[Let's hear that!]
I see you in the distance and I see us as we are
So nearly so contented but a careless word too far
I see you in confusion for a once enchanted boy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

I longed to love you better but I swear I don't know how
You could have been my future but I had to have it now
The things we love completely we are fated to destroy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

It's easy to be certain that another's heart will fall
Much harder to be certain of your own
It moves you, and inspires you then it drives you to the wall
And leaves you so excited but alone

My heart dances, oh oh
My heart dances, oh oh
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy
But not for joy
But not for joy
But not for joy
All the women who understand
How natural and good it is
To bare all clothes and bring the smile of knowledge
Try the freedom that comes with it

With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes
With a smile, trumpets and drums, the desire for meaning comes

Roaring inside her woman and anger, roaring inside her woman and ire
Roaring inside her woman and anger, roaring inside her woman and ire

All the women who understand
How good it is
To bare all clothes and bring the smile, smile of knowledge
Try the freedom that comes with it
Hello angel , do you know me ,I'm you man
Would that be hard for you to try and understand
I've been waiting for this day for so so long
Could lovin' you be so so wrong

It doesn't matter much to me
Baby , I been hurt before
Don't you ask me why I'm here
Back and knockin' at your door

Do you remember
Do you remember all the nights
And all the love we went through
Well you know maybe I thought you had some left over
Could I mean that much to you

It doesn't matter much to me
Baby, I been hurt before
Don't you ask me why I'm here
Back and knockin' at your door
Now open up your arms and take me
Make me love you till I die
You wouldn't have me when I was a young man
But tonight I'm gonna try

It doesn't matter much to me
Baby , I been hurt before
Don't you ask me why I'm here
Back and knockin' at your door
If heartaches brought fame
In love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
I'd be a legend in my time

Again
Again, this couldn't happen again
This is that once-in-a-lifetime, this is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now, and yet, never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when this doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever, but never, never again
Ain't I got the song of the robin
And I got a roof in the sky
Wonder why my heart keeps a-throbbin', throbbin'
A son of God's country, am I

Ain't I got the flames and the mountains
Ain't their treasures mine, if I try
One by one my blessings, I'm countin'. I'm countin'
A son of God's country am I

I got the sun up in the sky
The streams when I'm dry
The fruit on the boughs of the trees
The clouds bringin' me rain
The fields givin' me grain
Thanks to the Maker for these

Ain't I got a loved one who loves me
Kids to make my cares hurry by
I may not be in heaven, but I can't be far away
A son of God's country, am I
(Ain't I got a loved one who loves me) My baby loves me
(Kids to make my cares hurry by) Hurry by, hurry by, hurry by
I may not be in heaven, but I can't be far away
A son of God's country, am I
A son of God's country, am I
Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, everyday, it's a gettin' faster

Everyone said go ahead and ask her
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, hey, everyday, seems a little longer
And every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me

Everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, hey

Everyday, seems a little longer
And every way, a love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me

Oh, everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Hey, hey, hey
Love like ours will sure be here to stay
You told me that you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone and hours seem like years
So darling, I sing my song
Your leaving makes my heart beat slow and slow
Now I'm wondering where did you go
Please tell me, tell me what is wrong

I still love you
Won't you please come back to me?
Come back where, where you ought to be
Don't stay away from me
Cause you'll always be my own
We'll be together for eternity

You told me that you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone and hours seem like years
And you left me singing a song
I'm just singing a song
You left me singing a song...
I peeked in to say good-night
When I heard my child in prayer
"And for me, some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"

All our stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

[Intro: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Say, you
Who do you belong to?
Say, you
I've been hoping to meet you

[Verse 1: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Baby (Baby)
You've caught my eye
I can't deny
I realize it's you
I like what I see (I like it)
You're perfect to me (I like it)
Fast and fancy

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
I don't want to be friends if my heart caved in
Watching you play around (You play around)
This would make me mad (Make me mad)
Hurt so bad (Hurt so bad)
Drag my spirit down

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)

[Verse 3: David Ruffin + Melvin Franklin + (The Temptations)]
There's none quite as fair as you
(You're a sweet thing)
Let's make plans for two
Girl, say, you
If you love me, too, say you do
We shouldn't be apart
Forget your pride (Forget your pride)
Don't be shy (Don't be shy)
Give me the key to your heart, girl

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Say, you
Who do you love? (Say, you)
Who, who do you love?

[Outro: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Baby, say, you
Who do you belong to?
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Baby, baby, you, (say, you) lil' girl
(Baby, give me the key to your heart)
Oh, what happened to that beautiful smile?
Oh, the one that you gave me anytime we were face to face
Is it someone that's taking my place
Darling, what happened?
Oh, what happened to those fast heartbeats?
Oh, the one's, the one's that excited me so
Tell me, don't you love me, don't you love me no more
Darling, what happened?

Oh, it's so sad what a little time can do
Well, too much time with another
Careless love can change the two
Oh, what happened to the love we knew?
All of those good times, the good times, just me and you

Oh, baby, baby, before I go
Oh, it's just one thing I'd like to know
Oh, don't you love me, oh, don't you care, don't you care anymore?
Darling, what happened?

Oh, it's so sad, so sad what a little time can do
Yeah, it's too much time with another
Careless love can change the two
Oh, tell me what happened, baby, to the love we knew?
All the good times, the good times, just me and you
Oh, baby, baby, before I go
Oh, it's just one thing, one thing I'd like to know
Don't you love me, oh, don't you care anymore?
Darling, what happened?
We got to keep the lift, hope and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope and the struggle
Give me the strength the lift, hope and struggle

[Verse 1]
One for the money two for the show
Three get ready and go man go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Do anything but don't you step on my shoes

[Verse 2]
I know a girl she lives next door
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Do anything but don't you step on my shoes

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I know a girl she lives next door
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Do anything but don't you step on my shoes

[Verse 3]
People say I don't care
I know what I want so why should I care?
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Do anything but don't you step on my shoes, alright

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro: Michael McCary]
Hey, what's up? This is Michael
Just calling to see what you got going on this weekend
You know ever since I met you, I can't seem to let you go
Make sure you call me back, okay?

[Verse 1]
Ever since the day that we first met
Everything you do just seems to pique my interest
Girl, you know you pierce right through my soul
Make me wanna tell you things nobody knows, yeah

So here I am with heart in hand
Your life have a mission for both you and I in these demands
Wouldn't you like to take a trip with me?
Heaven knows just where this thing could lead
So how's about it?

[Chorus]
Howz about it
We can just go away
Howz about it
We can leave today
Howz about it
No need to pack, I'll handle everything
Take a private jet
And we can fly away
We can fly, fly away
Listen

[Verse 2]
See, maybe you think it's a bit too soon
I realize it's only been a week or two but
Feels I know you all of my life, yeah
And I wouldn't be surprised if one day you were my wife

[Chorus]
Howz about it
We can just go away
Howz about it
We can leave today
Howz about it
No need to pack, I'll handle everything
Take a private jet
And we can fly away

[Bridge]
Don't even give it too much thought
Just listen to your heart
We can go anywhere you wanna go
All you gotta is
All you gotta is
Let me know
Howz about it

[Chorus]
Howz about it
We can just go away
Howz about it
We can leave today
Howz about it
No need to pack, I'll handle everything
Take a private jet
And we can fly away

Howz about it
We can just go away
Howz about it
We can leave today
Howz about it
No need to pack, I'll handle everything
Take a private jet
And we can fly away

Howz about it
We can just go away
Howz about it
We can leave today
Howz about it
No need to pack, I'll handle everything, girl
Take a private jet
And we can fly away
Howz about it
We can just go away
Howz about it
We can leave today
Howz about it
No need to pack, I'll handle everything, girl
Take a private jet
And we can fly away
You are the summer and I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
Your song's beginning
While mine's nearly sung
Don't wait too long

Fall is a lovely time of the year
When leaves turn to gold and brown
But soon fall is ending
Winter is near and the leaves
Start tumblin' down

Why must the moments go by in such haste
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming I've no time to waste
Don't wait too long
I'd rather see my coffin comin'
Comin' through my back door
I'd rather see my coffin
Comin' through my back door
I'd rather see my coffin comin'
Comin' through my back door
Than the girl I'm a-lovin'
She say she don't love me no more

Can you see me leavin'
Babe, I sure left so far
Can you see me leavin'
I feel I sure left so far
Sometimes I'm a-wonderin'
Who you think you are
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more
So many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more
In the night, though we're apart
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Haunted heart won't let me be
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me
Dreams are dust; it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart
Be still, my haunted heart

[Intro]
I won't
I won't
I won't
I won't
Cause I came too far

[Verse 1]
Tryin to know what's goin' on
Echoes on my cellular phone
I noticed a couple items missing
Could it be the FEDS still listening?
See i outa' beat those cases
Dead time for the miscellaneous
And they proceed to keep on watching
Cause i outa seen them lately
Interrogated my mom
Locked up half of my crew!
But i can guarantee one thing that i won't let you DO!

[Chorus]
I won't let you lock me down
I won't let you push me 'round
I won't Let you stop me now
I won't, cause I came too far
I Won't let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
I won't , Noo not today!
I woont, Cause I came too far

[Verse ]
Devil's Always wathing me(wathing me)
Evil's always stocking me(stocking me)
God has been protecting me(protecting me)
And thats how i got this far
Cause when you look at me you see an ANGEL
Can't belive i been throught half the things that i went through
Cause everyday i see your face( my face)
Keep gettin screwed by the human race( my race)
So, Please dont you judge me unless you know me
Cause I won't let you. 

[Chorus]
I Won't let you lock me down
I Won't let you push me 'round
I Won't Let you stop me now
I Wooont , Cause i Came Too far

I Won't let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
I won't , Noo not today!
I woont, Cause I came too far
Came To far to turn back now( too far)
Came To Far to turn back now( too far)
Ain't no body gonna stop me( can't stop)
Ain't no body gonna stop me ( can't stop)

I Won't let you lock me down
I Won't let you push me 'round
I Won't let you stop me now
I Wooont , cause I came too far

I Won't let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
I won't , Noo not today!
I woont, Cause I came too far
That certain night, the night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

I may be right, I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
I know 'cause I was there
That night in Berkeley Square
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone

Well, the moon still in the sky
An' the sleep still in you eye
But when you hear me sing
You better make dem hammers ring

Wake up and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone

Well, you had a big time last night
And some of your heads are tight
But when I call this roll, please Lord
I don't want to miss a soul

So get up and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
When you break dem one by one
But man you just begun
'Cause today, I tell you something new
You gotta break dem two by two

So come on and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone

Well, I tell you man, if you good
You better chop dat stone like wood
Then tomorrow gonna be a big day
You get another shilling in you pay

'Cause from sun to sun you gotta stick
And don't tell me 'bout you sick
I want you to do your best
To night you better let them women rest

So you can get up and go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
Go down Emanuel Road, man and boy
Got to break that stone
All day long
I've been thinking about you, baby
With loving you on my mind
I couldn't hardly wait
To get home to you, baby
So I could do a little overtime
Baby, baby, you've been so good to me
I want to understand
If I want a do right woman
Then I've got to be a do right man

So I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes, I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Trying to keep Jody from my door

Oh I know I've been neglecting you
Lately, baby
Just trying to make ends meet
But tonight I'm gonna be
On my love job, baby
Me working on you, you working on me
Wine, music, and a little candlelight
Just to help me unwind
'Cause I know
I got so much love to give, baby
And tonight I'm gonna take my time

I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Before my flame gets too low
Said I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door

I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes, I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Just gotta keep Jody from my door

I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Before my flame gets too low
Think I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire, baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door . . 
Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
I woke up one morning
Waking with the rising sun
Woke up one morning
Awakin' with the rising sun, ahh
Thought about my baby
Did I just do what she done

Well, I shoulda loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
Oh, yes, I shoulda loved you more
I know I didn't treat her right
I know that a woman needs
Rollin' every day and night
Oh, yeah

Break:

Well, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
Yes, my heart beat like a hammer
My eyes plumb full of tears
She's been gone about an hour
But it seems like a thousand years
Don't ever dog your woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Don't ever dog your woman
You know you're gonna ruin yourself
Know that a woman she'll
Run off with somebody else
Oh, yeah
It only happens when I dance with you
That trip to Heaven when the dance is through
With noone else do the heavens seem quite so near
Why does it happen here, only with you?
Two cheeks together can be so sublime
Especially when those cheeks are yours and mine
I've danced with hundreds of others my whole life through
But the thrill that comes with spring
When anything can happen, it only happens with you
Usher

I was riding number 9
Heading south from Carolina
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow
Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my girl, left my home
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my baby's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia Main
And locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry
As the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

[Intro: Lil Duke & (Young Thug)]
Yeah, no more struggle, no more pain (what)
Fuck you mean? It's turnt up (Thugger, ay!)

[Hook: Lil Duke & (Young Thug)]
I'm just riding 'round, laid back (Skrrrrrrr!)
And I'm sipping purple drank
All the shit I go through, sometimes man I can't think
And all these haters 'round me, please move up out my space
Smoke so much with this bitch she say she can't feel her face
I been through hell and back, I ain't going back that route
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back that route
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back that route
Damn right I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I remember shooting it out with those runts man (bah!)
I remember shooting it out with four season (bah!)
I remember shooting it out with every fucking man
Now I look like Black Ken, ay
I remember going to war with all my fucking sisters (hey sister)
I remember falling in love with a fucking hooker (freak nasty ho)
I remember jumping on niggas like trampolines (let's get it)
I remember I ain't like to rap now rapping is my thing
It pays me, I get 7,500 a show nigga
Y'all little niggas ain't 'bout it, you wanna roll coke nigga
I remember that nasty white smell no coke nigga
I remember my momma broke down in coke 

[?]

[Hook: Lil Duke & (Young Thug)]
I'm just riding 'round, laid back (Skrrrrrrr!)
And I'm sipping purple drank
All the shit I go through, sometimes man I can't think
And all these haters 'round me, please move up out my space
Smoke so much with this bitch she say she can't feel her face
I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
I'm so sick of all this bullshit going on around me
Who are you to judge me, and ever try and down me (you can't)
Or clown me? (clown me)
And start grinding (grinding)
Said I used to shop at JC Penny now I'm worth a pretty penny
I was only tryna learn something, you said get out your business
Now I'm on the road I can't accept calls I'm probably busy
Now I don't got a brother, but I got a mother
That helped me, now she had my back, when no other
Had it, I don't give a damn man I got her back (I do)
What ever she need I swear I'm coming ASAP
Alright I do this for D'Asia, Samari, and Junior
I hope they stay in school I got kicked out as a junior

[Hook: Lil Duke & (Young Thug)]
I'm just riding 'round, laid back (Skrrrrrrr!)
And I'm sipping purple drank
All the shit I go through, sometimes man I can't think
And all these haters 'round me, please move up out my space
Smoke so much with this bitch she say she can't feel her face
I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back (hell and back)
I ain't going back
Damn right I been through hell and back, I ain't going back
Damn right

[Part I]

[Intro]
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before
I've been here before

[Verse]
Late for everything, my face to the cement
That's how I always seen it
I spent days faded and anemic
You could see it in my face, I ain't been eatin', I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out the gutter, mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, when and if the pen hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch in my space
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways

[Part II]

[Intro]
And if it's like that the whole time
If it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
And if it's like that the whole time, we'll be alright
Stayin' up all night, but it's alright
And I been stayin' up the whole night, but it's alright

[Verse]
It's me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
It's trouble, the way that we joggin'
Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
This spliff, I ain't splittin' no time soon
My brain split in two, it's rainin' a bit
I hope it's a monsoon, my face in the sink
I'm seein' my mom soon, I'm faded, I stink
Stay in it, alright..? (Faded, I'm stayin' in...)

[Part III]

[Instrumental]

[Part IV]

[Verse]
I got my grandmama's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And not by nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my sec
(And not by nothin' by myself)
My hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And not by nothin' but myself, my second thoughts
My hectic process of thinkin' and all my doubts, and I think
I know Nak in there sleepin', he on the couch, that's my brother
Give me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love him
To tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be druggin'
To tell the truth, I'm not supposed to be off in here
I'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'
To tell the truth, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, you can't be loud when you're the wrongest, fam
To tell the truth, I'm at a loss of friends
Well time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands
I'm the youngest old man that you know
If ya soul intact, let me know

[Part V]

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
I love rapping in New York
KK and dirty lemonade
And I just checked the charts too
I'm still #1 (hahaha)

[Verse]
Uh
Wake up wake up
Bake up bake up
Money comin'
She lookin' good
With no make up
Pull up pull up
Full of that Kush
I wish you would
My neck of the woods
Is misunderstood
No pain no gain
I play the game
Got cars got fame
Got on these chains
I stayed the same
When she come over I need more brain
And we get stoned and we gon' ball a high scorin' game
Them niggas cool, they ain't right tho
I have you somewhere by the pool gettin' right
Leavin' school takin' flights
Sayin' you would, would you might tho
Stop fuckin' with the nigga that you with
It's Taylor Gang life
You be pourin' out champagne, spillin' it up
Puttin' money in the safe, would be fillin' it up
Got the number one record and I'm still in the cut
It's the Gang baby, ain't nobody realer
Roll the next one bigger

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby

[Wiz talking]
Let's light a joint
Drink some 

[mushroom tea?]
Have a conversation
I wanna take you around the world
I wanna show you some things
I wanna get away from all that shit
Just leave it all
If you smoke a little bit of weed
I'll some a little bit with you

[Outro]
Yeah
Taylor Gang
We ain't going no where
We just gettin' higher
Tryin' to do things
When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chittlins'

When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!
Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down

We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says "Pork Pie Hat Bar"
And there's black babies dancing...
Tonight!

[Chorus]
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy

[Snoop Dogg]
Huh, it's like that that there
They love it when I let down my hair
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel
So I let 'em all come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if they able
Bottles of everything, models and everything
Everything goes and yes I mean everything
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So, I invite her over to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down
My life is like one big highlight
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion
With some whites, some asians and persians
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains
She say she wanna be an actress
So I pointed to these nuts and then I yelled ACTION!
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck
Huh, yeah, here we go again
I gotta go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm just too much commotion
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, "One Love"
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues
I just stepped in for a quick cameo
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio
He keep a bad ho, I keep a bad ho
He slide me new hoes everywhere we go
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight
Yes, these Hollywood nights
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out
Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it
Get some m_nage, durin' every visit
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Pharrell & Stevie Wonder]
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (L.A., in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yeah (L.A., in Los Angeles)

You can make it on the light blue box, yeah (L.A., in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California roll-olls, yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask if you can roll
You say "Bro, don't you know I'm from 'round here?"
Well girl, I like the way you roll, even though you from the ghetto
You belong in a home in the mountains
Not talking 'bout the view
I'm talking 'bout me and you
So if you wanna go to Melrose
Let's hit Adidas, girl we got our own shell toes
And then we'll go to Venice
You roll so good, you might as well let me hit it
For like fifteen minutes
Girl, you never gon' forget it
And if you wanna go around town
I could show you where all the real get it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talking 'bout them fools
I'm talking 'bout me and you

[Chorus: Pharrell & Stevie Wonder]
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (L.A., in Los Angeles)
Get yourself a medical card, yeah (L.A., in Los Angeles)

You can make it on the light blue box, yeah (L.A., in Los Angeles)
Cause that's how California roll-olls, yeah

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder & Both]
And when I hand you that weed and I ask if you can roll
You say, "No", let me show you around here

Rodeo with a winner, Rodeo loud, yeah
Ain't got nothing to lose
I'm talking 'bout me and you
And girl I got a, home in the Valley
And the Rolls in the valet, just tell 'em what my name is
You heard about me, you heard all about me
Mean you heard all the hittas that I'm with gangbanging
But I ain't talking 'bout the news (I'm talking 'bout me and you)
Girl you know that I'm talking 'bout you
Let me show you all around
I could show you where all the real get it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talking bout them fools
I'm talking 'bout me and you

Girl I'll eat you up (Eat you up)
It's when you realize you're in Heaven
Like how'd you get there?

Uh
She's impressed by a fat boy
Cadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy
Home run hitter, thought I was a batboy
Search warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it
Paid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it
She a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard
Hustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it
Blue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force
Impeccable suits, as I run with my dogs
Pinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job
Dogg pound niggas, and we came to fight
I was several million up before it came to light
Now they callin' me the truest one to ever do it
Status symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music
Smoked out like a player and you know the name
Break a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game
Maybach Music

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we

Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it... make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place

Hurry, hurry

Something's burning
You see the party people rocking side to side
And if you feel it, let me hear you say, "Oh"
Cause I gotta know

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, knot unlocking, baby this is for real

Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Pharrell Williams]
You must let go of that mind control
That's coming out your television and radio
You must escape (Say what?) escape from here!
Get intelligent when you hit that shit and let it go (Blow)
Far from here, let it go (Just blow)
Let it go

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, knot unlocking, baby this is for real

I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut, you crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg with Charlie Wilson]
You try to survive
You're under pressure cause you're running outta time
But this is not a chance you wanna blow
Cause we gotta go
The deed is murder
You think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind
Make you move when you hear them screaming, "Ho"
Cause I gotta go

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
She's DTF cause she's down to feel
That aromatic, knot unlocking, baby this is for real
Are you a freak, or what?
I'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut, you crack me up
Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?

Got 'em running upstairs got 'em coming in pairs
May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there
She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there

Quit tripping on me, be concerned with yourself

You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'
Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy, I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodgin' the leeches, I'm signin' agreements
I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh
Another one

Busting down the Rollie diamond dealing like a rainbow
I do what I wana I go places that you can't go
Leaning in my motherfucking Phantom like a Kangol
I fuck all my bitches on the jet, jet, jet, jet
You fuck all your hoes and pay a check, check, check, check
She gon' bless the kid out of respect, pect, pect, pect
Let her count the money now she wet, wet, wet, wet

[Chorus]
Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
Flexing from the bottom
We just want the money the respect and all the power
The money and the power
Fucking up a check, check, check, check, check
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check
These bitches fucking for a check, check, check, check, check
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check

[Verse 3]
Look at all these young niggas, drug dealers
Lookin' like we came up on the plug nigga
Pick that fuck that check up in the club nigga
And then buy your bitch a bag straight out of love nigga
I'm talking young niggas, drug dealers
Swerving in the Phantom sipping mud nigga
This gon be the anthem that they love nigga

[Chorus]
Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
Flexing from the bottom
We just want the money the respect and all the power
The money and the power
Fucking up a check, check, check, check, check
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check
These bitches fucking for a check, check, check, check, check
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check

[Verse 1]
'Cause I was still unsure
But it's something I'm used to
And I could tell by your face
No one's ever been rude to you
But I could tell you things
That I can't say to anyone
And you came 'round today
But you didn't stay very long

[Bridge]
Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried whose audience will lose you

[Verse 2]
And I had no idea
What that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you've changed
By the people around you
I used to take the long way
Just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside
But I guess I won't anymore

[Outro]
There's so much I wanna tell you
So much I wanna tell you

[Produced by DJ Clockwork]

[Intro]
Like clockwork (Like, like clockwork)
Yeah (Like)
Well

[Verse]
Well, it's the maniac with zany raps, made millions off of baby Mac
My brain, it ain't attached, you love me? It's a little late for that
They gave my crazy ass a label, everything is rated X
I'm far beyond divorced middle-aged men who pay for sex
I work like I ain't made it yet, deserve this motherfuckin' paper
Get a Kit-Kat, break it in half, save one for later
Death to any traitor, that's a Benedict Arnold
I be wildin', goin' broke at international car shows
I'm a lawn mower, mad face get redder than a dog boner
Thank God I got sober, pot smoker, top roller, thought holder
Was a little kid until I got older
Wild since a child, pulled my file out of God's folder
Now let me talk slower, you can understand me now
We the originators, your style hand-me-down, yeah
They got me turnin' up, the amp is loud
The apocalypse is comin', so we campin' out at Granny's house
Dancin' with a bitch and pull her panties down, it's bush league
I love a little nature, addin' flavor to the pussy
People tend to overlook me and my agent overbook me
I'ma get it while the gettin' good, feel better than forever
I'm National Treasure like Nicolas Cage
I'm a shelter for these animals, got bitches for days
She be feedin' on my semen and it's cinnamon glaze
I tell her keep it or delete it, this the digital age
Now I'm muscle-buildin' just so I can juggle children daily
I'm fucked up in the head a bit, I'm Rumpelstiltskin-crazy
These bitches gettin' wet when I pull up in the Mercedes
Bitch, I be with Mr. T, I'm simply the fuckin' A-Team
Make dreams reality
Say "Hi" when you see me, my "Hello" is a formality
I'm comin' with a cavalry
Of motherfuckers trained from watchin' Braveheart battle scenes
Waste of space, and we paint our faces like it's Halloween

[Outro]
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Boo!
Now let me see you bang it
I like it when you bang it
Now let me see you shake it
I wanna see you shake it

I love it when you freak it
Now let me see you work it
I wanna see you twerk it
Now let me see you bang it

[Verse 1]
I have seen too many things
That'll make you want to sing, sing, sing
But that ain't what's been on my mind (I'm coming home tonight)

Oh baby, I've been up and down this road
Or so you have been told
But you won't be alone tonight (I'm coming home tonight)

[Pre-Hook]
I promise baby, would I lie to you?
I'm just being, honest baby
I want to fall in love tonight

[Hook]
I'm gonna row, row, row this boat
All across the seven seas just to see your face
And you won't be alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)
I know you know ain't nobody in this world that can take your place
And I won't leave you alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting for too long
And this feeling has got too strong
Baby, I've waited all my life (I'm coming home tonight)
I can tell you what I've seen
But that don't mean a thing to me
You got me on your own tonight (I'm coming home tonight)

[Pre-Hook]
I promise baby, would I lie to you?
I'm just being, honest baby
I want to fall in love tonight

[Hook x2]
I'm gonna row, row, row this boat
All across the seven seas just to see your face
And you won't be alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)
I know you know ain't nobody in this world that can take your place
And I won't leave you alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)

Smoking on Cuban cigars like a banner

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Gotta be crazy, you gotta be mean
Gotta keep your shoes and your car clean
Gotta keep smiling, you gotta keep fit
You gotta keep drinking, you gotta eat shit
You gotta be small to be a big shot
Gotta eat meat to stay at the top
You gotta be trusted, you gotta tell lies
Gotta be able to narrow your eyes
You gotta believe they gotta believe you
Gotta appear easy to see through
Gotta be sure you look good on TV
Gotta resemble a human being
You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder
Gonna get harder as you get older
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand
Gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer

[David Gilmour's scat singing]

[Verse 2: Roger Waters] (David Gilmour Harmonies)
And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down
All alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
You've gotta be sure, you gotta be quick
Gotta divide the tame from the sick
Gotta keep all of us docile and fit
Gotta keep everyone buying this shit
They gotta get you started early
Processed by the time you're thirty
You work like fuck until you're sixty-five
And time's your own until you die
Gotta admit to a lot of confusion
Pain in the head is the child of collusion
Gotta resist this creeping malaise
Gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze
But you, you just keep on pretending
You can tell a sucker from a friend
But you still raise the knife
Stranger, lover, friend and foe alike

[Verse 4: Roger Waters] (David Gilmour and Rick Wright backup)
Who was born in a house full of pain
Born in a house full of pain
Who was sent out to play on his own
Sent out to play on his own
Who was raised on a diet of shame
Raised on a diet of shame
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with bridle and bit
Fitted with bridle and bit
Who was given a seat in the stand
Given a seat in the stand
Who was forcing his way to the rail
Forcing his way to the rail
Who was offered a place on the board
Offered a place on the board
Who was only a stranger at home
Only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Dragged down by the stone

[Intro]
Ah, let the thirty-day countdown begin, man
In the studio every motherfuckin' day
I told y'all, man, the hunger is real
Been doin' this shit too long, man
Seems I got to take these niggas to school
Eight albums, let's go

[Verse 1]
Luda, class is in session
For the little nigga from Atlanta with the light complexion
Steppin' on the track and (-) the verse
Puttin' rappers in a hearse, this my profession
I keep 'em guessin', don't nobody want to test them
If you don't want 'em up in your baby momma
Somebody better find a way to arrest him
You handcuff him, I dance, sucker
Keep that pussy to a pole, then I let my man fuck her
I'm gone, I'm trippin', I'm high of that medicine
Know that strong, that sticky, that critical condition
It's Lil' Fate, it's Luda and Drizzer down all together, man
Yeah, we smoke some buddha
Was cool, but now we feel better, man
I got hella game and hella dollars
Traded in that Range and just got three Impalas
Rollin' like a G and bendin' corners on Ds
Steady countin' Ms with bank accounts overseas
Splittin' open Bs and droppin' the top on Vs
Other rappers countin' Zs, but they bitches pop them Ps

[Outro]
Ah, pop it, pop it, pop it
Oh, man, I'm havin' too much fuckin' fun, man

If you ain't gonna ride fly than you might as well hate
Shit, I gotta eat, yeah, even though I ate
No it ain't my birthday but I got my name on my cake
Shit, believe that: if your mans wanna play
I'mma fuck around and put that boy's brains on the gate
Hey pick em up! Fuck em, let em lay
Where I'm from we see a fuckin' dead body everyday
That's - Uptown! Throw a stack at em
Make a song about me, I'm throwing shots back at 'em
Ya bitch on my pipe, and she like a crack addict
She saw me cooking eggs and she thought I was back at it
I grab the keys, "ho I gotta go"
I got my motorcycle jacket and my motorcycle locs

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Birdman]

Shorty, 98's, 45 paper plates
Tint the whole thang, big money heavyweight
A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a Caddy, 25 on the pinky
Bought a pound of blow and bounced back
Matching grills, big houses on the hill
Got them hoes in the kitchen all cooking, paying bills
I start to holler, dollar after dollar
Flipping chickens, getting tickets. Want the money and the power
Born Stunna, Uptown hunter
3rd ward G, nigga, been about money
Ice chunky, Birdman, red monkeys
White Tees on the chromed-out 11 hundreds
You know we shine every summer, we grind every summer
And this is how we spend money
You see them Bentleys and them Lambs'
Them ounces and them grams, bitch we was born hustlas

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah when I was 16 I bought my first Mercedes Benz
I must've fucked a thousand bitches and they girlfriends
White leather, hot new bare rims
Brand new pistol with a trigger like a hair pin
Big work, we don't need a scale man!
Big papers: say "good morning" to the mailman
What you know about putting bricks in the spare, man?
I can stuff a coupe like a motherfuckin' caravan
I'm in my zone, my form is so rare, man
If there's a throne, you looking at the chairman
How you want it, show me my opponent
*Munching noises*
Show me my opponent
I'm still ballin, a bullet gotta get me
And I've never been a pussy cause my hood never let me
A made nigga, got made niggas with me

[Tommy Mara]
The other thing is this I want you to learn: I want to go around all over the streets, and you make yourself a protector. You go in, and you make sure these guys are all safe, okay, you offer them an order of protection for a small nominable fee, and thats the way you do it. You walk in and you tell 'em, "Hey, you know, we're gonna take care of your business, but you gotta pay us X amount of dollars a week." So you collect from them, you bring it to us, we give your piece and you're earning the money for the family, and then you go up and up and up the pole

[Tommy Mara]
I'm so glad to see how far you came in life. And now since you're gonna become one of the bosses, it's nice to see that someone is following in my footsteps. Carry on the name and tradition, but remember one thing: It's respect, never cross the line, and you'll always earn a lot of cash money

[Hook]
And I'm ridin' wit a body on the shotty
Stretch a nigga out like Pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hidey
Snatch all the honey from your honeycomb, now the bees keep flyin' by me
I'm on that piff, that potty
That shit, smokin' like Vladi, spendin' dough from the 90's
Shiny P-90 in the lining
I'm dining, don't time me mu'fucka

[Verse 1]
I'm a, young ass piranha
Don't get caught in that water cause I'm waitin' for a drowner
And on the corner I got packs on the counter
Before ya bitch leave I make Young Marl count 'em
Tryin' to get a dollar i could turn into a thousand
I'm so determined its a economic problem, drama
That's why I carry the llama
Ready at any given day to bury my honor
Love weed so much i tried to marry Juana
So pass the pastrami and asparagus mama, I'm lunchin'
Cause in my area
If you got bread you better break it or we sharin' ya
I got his ankles, and his stereo
Cause i could get a cool buck fifty for that and the barrio, that's Hollygrove
It's Hollygrove til I adios
I gotta go, gotta go, got more bags to dope, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hot Boy Wayne
Since the beginning I've been in and out of some shit
Thinnin' out the thick
Living out the script, for the role that was chosen
But I don't want an award, I'm tryin' to afford
Back to the road in a Honda Accord
The whole right side slam down with that raw
A city supply the city get high, like
If I was Clear I woulda touched Claudette
I'm so fresh, like sex in the sheets
But I'm from the dirty dirty, like sex on the beach
The checks on my Nikes they match my carneesh
The button up shirt match my button seats
The AK-47 match my fuckin' heat
Watch your fuckin' feet cause I'm hot in the streets
A quarter thing is how i got in the streets
I had money ever since that week, young Weezy!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
17 gangsta, Hollygrove soldier
Got a lil money, got a lot more colder
My top don't roll up, it fold up
My money don't fold up, it build up
You niggas ain't fly, get your gear up
Copped my bitch the Marc Jacob boots, and the ear muffs
Got her lookin' like Kamora or somethin
Brought Kamora to the South now Kamora stuntin'
Yeah we big business pimpin', chyea
Walkin' wit a limp, talkin' with a slur
Barkin' at ya' bitch, bet her pussycat purr
She all on mine, she ain't lookin' at yours
And if a man trip he get the blit bla blat blurr
Credit Wayne for bringin' the hood back first, chyea........chyea
Credit Wayne for bringin' the hood back first! Chyea!

[Hook]
And I'm ridin' wit a body on the shotty
Stretch a nigga out like Pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hidey
Snatch all the honey from your honeycomb, now the bees keep flyin' by me
I'm on that piff, that potty
That shit, smokin' like Vladi, spendin' dough from the 90's
Shiny P-90 in the lining
I'm dining, don't time me mu'fucka
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, yeah

We dance and sing somewhere in between heaven and hell
Gabrielle, that was her name
Everyone was smiling, dreamin' through their tears, under a spell

But in Gabby's eyes, nothing
I asked do you not like the music?
She says it's alright
But she dances to her own sad tune, she said

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you, baby
Long as I'm there with you

I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream
Nightmares to live where you live
Tears well in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall
I'd give the world to know where her smile is
I asked will you dance with me now
Let me try to figure out
The fastest route out of town and she says

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you baby

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got a full tank of gas, girl
Anywhere you wanna go, girl
All you have to do is ask girl, ohh she said

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you baby

Come on and take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go long as I'm there with you

[Intro]
My father was a black panther
My father who ain't in heaven

[Verse 1]
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

[Bridge] (2x)
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
They throwin' pussy at me
I know that pussy ain't free
I know that pussy ain't free

[Verse 3]
New slaves
And your brand new car
New slaves
With your brand new job
Its still a new slave
No matter who you are

[Bridge] (2x)
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Outro: Kanye West & Frank Ocean]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)

[Kóbor János]
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

[Intro]
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever

[Verse 1]
She let me ride it like a caravan baby
I swear I need you to come lay right there with me
She say she down and she gon' lay and care for me
I don't know why she like the air that I'm breathing in
Baby, breathe in with me
You make me go brazy, I know you won't judge me
You might turn to wifey, give you wife things and babies

[Chorus]
I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

[Bridge]
She want it heavy like a bear
I told her drop that shit right here
I cut that pussy, barber chair
Then I'm goin' psh off in the air

[Verse 2]
Shine it up then bounce it, climbing in it just like a mountain
My bankroll big like a bouncer, spitting game like a counselor
Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins?
Body red like an apple
Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my mother
Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others
I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper
I get respect from her brother, Crenshaw boolin', Nipsey Hussle
Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we gon' wrestle
Chanel pouch on my left, fuck the cops we don't play
Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like "who is that?"
They be like "where you at?", meet at the Valet at Saks

[Chorus]
I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

[Interlude]
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
Until we meet each other, oh
I want you to love me forever
Love me forever
I want you to love me forever

[Verse 3]
She love my life and she don't care
I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it
You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty
I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy
Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch
Woah, she standing naked bookin' bhicken
Woah, I need them thick thighs on my chicken
You know, just got dropped off by Scotty Pippen
Woah, and I just wanna be loved
Help the poor, won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby listen to my plead
I need you so much, I need your care
Need all the loving baby you can spare
Help the poor, oh baby, won't you help poor me

Say you will, say you'll help me on
I can't make it no further in this world alone
Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes
For your loving don't you realize
I need help, oh baby, help poor me

You are my inspiration
You could make me be a king
But if you don't come to my rescue
I couldn't ever be anything

Help the poor, won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby listen to my plead
Well I lost my courage till I found you
You got what it takes baby to pull me through
Help the poor, oh baby, won't you help poor me
I'm in trouble don't you see
Only your love can save me
Help the poor, help the poor

Help the poor
Help the poor
Help the poor

[B. B. King Chorus]
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Ooooh, everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby
Because it's you I hate to lose

Well nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well those worries and trouble darling
Babe you know I had my share

Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday,  I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby
Because it's you I hate to lose

Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well those worries and trouble darling
Babe you know I had my share
I've got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh, if my baby should quit me
I believe I would die
Oh if my baby should quit me
Lord I do believe I would die
Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

[Chorus]
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes, when you were loving me, baby
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

[Chorus]

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois

[Chorus]

[Talking]

I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
I said You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: "thanks for the snack"
I let you live in my penthouse
You said it just a shack
I gave you seven children
And now you wanna give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?
I was in love with you, baby
Honey, before I learned to call your name
I was in love with you, baby
Honey, before I learned to call your name
The way you treat me, baby
Gonna drive old me insane

You know I love you, baby
I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you, baby
I'll do anything you tell me to
Nothing in this world, baby
Honey, that I wouldn't do for you

[Chorus 2x]
So, if you love me, baby
Honey, I'll do everything I say
Yeah, if you love me, baby
Honey, I'll do everything I say
If you don't do what I tell you, baby
Well, I'll fall on your knees and pray
Hey, be my girlfriend, everybody
And I'm gonna be your boy
Want you to be my girlfriend, baby
Baby, I'm gonna be your boy
Gonna buy me a Cadillac car, baby
Drive me where ever you are
Yes she's 36 in the bust
28 in the waist, 44 in the hips
She got a real crazy legs
You upsets me baby
Yes you upsets me baby

[Chorus]
Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman what you do to me

Well, she's not too tall, complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out the way she wears her hair
You upsets me baby
Yes you upsets me baby

[Chorus]
Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman, woman what you do to me

Well, I try to describe her, it's hard to stop
I better stop now because I got a weak heart
You upsets me
Well you upsets me baby

[Chorus]
Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman what you do to me

Well, I try to describe her, it's hard to stop
I better stop now because I got a very weak heart
You upsets me baby
Yes you upsets me baby

[Chorus]
Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman what you do to me
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
The way I used to love you baby
Baby that's the way I hate you now

Oh you once said you loved me
And you would do anything I said
Oh you once said you loved me baby
And you would do anything I said
Oh but the way you treat me now baby
I would much rather be dead

You said once that you loved me
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
You said that you loved me baby
But baby I believe you've changed your mind
Well but I don't blame you baby
Because you ain't what you used to be

Oh let me love you just one more time(3x)
Oh you can't quit me now baby
Because you didn't mean me no good anyway

Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now
The way I used to love you
Baby that's the way I hate you now
Worry worry worry
Worry is all I can do
Oh worry worry worry baby
Worry is all I can do
Oh my life is so miserable baby
Baby, and its all on account of you

You hurt me so bad baby
When you said we were through
Oh you hurt me
You know you hurt me so bad baby
When you said we were through
Oh but I would rather be dead baby
Then to be here so alone and blue

Someday baby
Oh someday baby
Oh! someday baby
Oh! oh! oh oh yes
Oh! someday baby
Yes someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
Someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
You know you won't be able to hurt me no more baby
'Cause my heart won't feel no pain

[Skit presents on Live in County Jail, 1971]

Ladies. I said Ladies! Ladies, if you got a man and the man don't do like you think he should... ladies, you don't hurt 'im. I said you don't hurt him! Men happens to be God's gift to women! So, ladies, you must know that the man is already grown so you can't raise him over again

So the thing to do is throw your arms around him! Hold him close to you! Look him straight in the eyes! And then you tell him... you tell him, you say "Now baby you been messing up, but I know you gonna do me better." and when he look at you as if he wanna know when, then you tell him..."someday baby". and if it seem like he's hard of hearing or not paying you much attention or something do like you ladies are known to do... Put your hands on your hips and then you say it again... Ow! He has to be a mighty hard hearted person not to listen to you

But I don't think it's fair to just talk to the ladies, I think I should say a few words to the men too. So, fellas... I said "Fellas"! Fellas if you got a woman and the lady don't do like you think she should, don't you be goin' upside of her head now. you know what i'm talkin' about, don't you be beatin' on her. The judgement's much cheaper if you don't beat her. and you see if you hurt her you only do one thing... I said if youhurt her you only do one thing! you make her a little smarter and she won't let you catch her the next time. so the thing to do is throw your arms around the pretty little thing! Now listen to me, listen to me... I don't care if she weigh thirty-two and a half pounds wet or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet. If she's your lady and you dig her, than she's your pretty little thing... and then you tell her! You say "Baby! Baby, I don't care what they say about you on the next block, your my little lady and I dig you. let 'em talk, let 'em say what they want to say"

And fellas, you must know too that the ladies, god bless their sweet little souls, ladies happens to be God's gift to man too fellas. You all agreed? You better say it cause your wife is listening. But there's just one more thing I must say to you, fellas. Just one more thing. Don't be too proud to beg. I said don't be too proud to beg! If you have to fall down on your knees to let your woman know that you love her, go on down there! I can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this evening...what i'm tryin' to say, ladies, love to hear their men say "Baby, I love you!" don't you ladies? I said: ladies! Love to hear their men say "Baby, I love you!"
Don't you ladies? So fellas tell your lady that you love her! She might think you're lying though. Tell your lady that you love her even if you are lying

But seriously speaking, when I goof, when I goof I usually slide up to my woman and i look straight at her... I have to get my look first... I usually say I look like a little puppy begging for that last bone you been holding out on. I look straight at her and I say "Baby! Please forgive me, honey!" And then i wait a few minutes to see how she take it and then I say "Baby! Please forgive me, honey!" and then I stand back far enough so that when she swings, I can duck... and then I say "Baby! You know when I goofed last week, I was high". If she let me get away with that then I look at her real pitifull like this... Say "Baby! Honey, you know when you're high, it don't count". And then I tell her, I say "If you forgive me, honey, I'm gonna do better". And if she look at me as if she wanna know when, then I tell her "someday, baby"
I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've feel so bad, my baby gone

I ain't got nobody, staying home with me
I ain't got nobody, staying home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no loving, since my baby's been gone

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no loving, since my baby been gone

Everybody
Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
When I ride by, I want you to see what I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit's very clear, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Pass me a joint, guarantee Imma hit it
Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it
I got a old school ass car you can sit in
I got a crib that you probably can't get it
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it
I been at work on the grind for a minute
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Countin' my benjis
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish
When you stay all on your grind you can get it
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention
I be so high, you should prolly come visit
You make a choice, hope you like your decision
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician
She ain't have fun, then she probably was trippin'
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Get to this money, get high, my intentions
Family first, that's a valuable lesson
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together, we stick to the mission
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together, we stick to the mission
Rollin' that weed up without no permission, uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, oh
Money come and money go, we stay the same though
Oh, oh
Money come and money go, we stay the same though
Oh, oh
Money come and money go, we stay the same though
Oh, oh
Money come and money go, we stay the same though

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Still getting richer, her friend came for richer
Ain't answer my calls and I guess you don’t know 'bout this blessing you missin'
Keys in ignition, ready to start it
Killing that pussy, that’s dearly departed
OK, now give me your thoughts on this carpet
Just got the call, Imma pull up and park it
Smellin' like kush, what could you tell me?
Body all chocolate like Keisha in Belly
Damn girl I like what you do with that jelly
You here for your interview, shoutout O'Reilly
We gettin' money nigga case closed
All hundreds to the bankroll
If you coming nigga, let’s go
I’m talking crab with the eggroll
Just shot a text “What you doin tonight?”
Oh is you down for the chewin' the night?
Turn off the lights but that ain’t what I like
I want to see what you do in the light
Told me you grown and don’t need no permission
If it hadn’t been for you Ima need intervention
Hold up a second, I’m talkin', just listen
What’s on your mind?
Don’t make no decisions
I’m gone

[Verse 1]
Love came to my door with a sleeping roll and a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman to court and spark

[Verse 2]
He was playing on the sidewalk for passing change
When something strange happened, glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made in People's Park
And went looking for a woman to court and spark

[Chorus 1]
It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried sometimes
I worry sometimes

[Verse 3]
"All the guilty people," he said, "they've all seen the stain
On their daily bread, on their Christian names
I cleared myself, I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me, I'd complete you."

[Verse 4]
His eyes were the color of the sand and the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know, the more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A
City of the fallen angels

[Verse 1]
All the people at this party, they've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries, they've got passport smiles
Some are friendly, some are cutting, some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre, giving to get something

[Verse 2]
Photo beauty gets attention, then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth and a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy, then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying, you know it's the same release

[Verse 3]
I told you when I met you I was crazy, cry for us all beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker and stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence, thinking I don't understand

[Verse 4]
I feel like I'm sleeping, can you wake me?
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings with a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to people's parties, fumbling deaf, dumb and blind

[Verse 5]
I wish I had more sense of humor, keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away

[Verse 1]
Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full of mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Do you think this can be real?

[Verse 2]
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and clamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around

[Verse 3]
You've had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if I'm worthy
Like the church, like a cop, like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval

[Verse 4]
Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said, "Send me somebody
Who's strong and somewhat sincere"
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love that don't seem to cease

[Verse 1]
I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waiting for his car on the hill
He makes friends easy, he's not like me
I watch for judgement anxiously
Now where in the city can that boy be?

[Chorus]
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill

[Verse 2]
He's a real good talker, I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
But there's still no buzzer, they roll on
And I'm waiting for his car on the hill
It always seems so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter, when there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark

[Chorus]
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill

[Verse 1]
Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high and told yourself were true
Lost or changing as the days come down to you

[Chorus 1]
Down to you, constant stranger
You're a kind person, you're a cold person too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you

[Bridge]
You go down to the pick up station
Craving warmth and beauty
You settle for less than fascination
A few drinks later you're not so choosy
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
On this strange new flesh you've found
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf, you hurry
To the blackness and the blankets
To lay down an impression and your loneliness

[Verse 2]
In the morning there are lovers in the street, they look so high
You brush against a stranger and you both apologize
Old friends seem indifferent, you must have brought that on
Old bonds have broken down, love is gone
Love is gone, written on your spirit this sad song
Love is gone

[Verse 3]
Everything comes and goes
Pleasure moves on too early and trouble leaves too slow
Just when you're thinking you've finally got it made
Bad news comes knocking at your garden gate

[Chorus 2]
Knocking for you, constant stranger
You're a brute, you're an angel
You can crawl, you can fly too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you

[Verse 1]
I'm always running behind the time
Just like this train
Shaking into town with the brakes complaining
I used to count lovers like railroad cars
I counted them on my side
Lately I don't count on nothing
I just let things slide

[Chorus 1]
The station master's shuffling cards
Boxcars are banging in the yards
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness 'cause you lost your heart

[Verse 2]
I went looking for a cause or a strong cat without claws
Or any reason to resume
And I found this empty seat in this crowded waiting room
Everybody waiting
Old man sleeping on his bags
Women with that teased-up kind of hair
Kids with the jitters in their legs and those wide, wide open stares

[Chorus 2]
And the kids got Cokes and chocolate bars
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness 'cause you've lost your heart

[Bridge]
What are you going to do now?
You've got no one to give your love to

[Verse 3]
Well I've got this berth and this pull down blind
I've got this fold up sink
And these rocks and these cactuses going by
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Settle down into the clickety clack
With the clouds and the stars to read
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have
Watching your hairline recede, my vain darling

[Chorus 3]
Watching your hair and clouds and stars
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
This jealous lovin's bound to make me crazy
I can't find my goodness, I lost my heart
Oh, sour grapes because I lost my heart

[Intro]
He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion, he was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves

[Verse 1]
She says: "Let me sit down, you know, drinkin' alone's a shame
It's a shame, it's a crying shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us 'round a bottle and we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery"

[Verse 2]
I'm a pretty good cook, I'm sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking, trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasin', I was raised on robbery

[Verse 3]
We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
You should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne, he put it in a ditch
He drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery

[Verse 4]
You know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full length mink
Hey, where you going? Don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robbery

[Verse 1]
Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change and that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you, keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you to defy him
When you're this weak and this spacey?

[Verse 2]
So what are you going to do about it?
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion, you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

[Chorus 1]
They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes too
Trouble child, breaking like the waves at Malibu

[Verse 3]
So why does it come as such a shock
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human is going over too

[Chorus 2]
Well, some are gonna knock you
And some'll try and clock you
You know it's really hard to talk sense to you
Trouble child, breaking like the waves at Malibu
Shorty like a precious jewel
I'll take care of you
You can put your heart right in my hands
Oh
Baby, you're like the rarest flower
I'll make sure you bloom

Baby
Just imagine if I was your man
Oh, baby
I pray to you
Breakfast in the bed
And every night I'd sing to you
No matter what it is
Before you sleep

I'll have you saying
Ooh
How did he know just what to do?
Like a radio
I'm tuned into your soul
Oooh, oh
If
If it was up to me
You know I'd fill you up with love
And make it flow like water

Stars at the sky
I'll place 'em in your eye
Oooh
Since I was a young player talking to the ladies
I just know

It's just my intuition
(I know what you like)
(Shorty, how you like it?)
I know if it possess you
I know what you feel
You can't even fight it

It's just my intuition
I know your every wish
Shorty, let me in your life
And watch me put it down

[Intro]
You ok?
Yeah, what up?
You went out
I went out where?
You were asleep
Wow

[Verse 1]
Damn, I've must of fallen asleep
All that I remember, girl is turning you over
I'm having flashbacks of your feet on my chest
Around my waist and over my shoulder
That thing was stronger than Patron
(Got me higher than some weed)
Hit me harder than some E, uh
I guess I took the most of
Whatever you gave me
And it's all I need from you

[Chorus]
When I'm on the inside (Bottom of the ocean)
Girl, it feels like (Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill (Sleeping pill)
Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night (Bottom of the ocean)
So gone that I couldn't gotten robbed (Swimming in slow motion)
Girl, you got the sleeping pill (Sleeping pill)
Ooh, you got that sleeping pill (Sleeping pill)

[Verse 2]
Damn, you must be playing for keeps (Playing)
Sex's so good my toes are numb
And I can't feel my fingers
Girl, what you do with your love (With your love)
Got your body singing harmony, but shorty you ain't no singer
You should know that a part of me to share with you never wants to wake up
Made a connection with your love inception

[Chorus:]
When I'm on inside (Bottom of the ocean)
Girl, it feels like (Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill
Oh, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night (Bottom of the ocean)
So gone that I couldn't gotten robbed (Swimming in slow motion)
Ooh, you got the sleeping pill (Sleeping pill)
Girl, you got that sleeping pill

[Bridge]
Kinda love I'm feeling in
I lost control, next thing I know nobody wouldn't go
Least I remember was closing my eyes
Kissing your lips and went down to your thighs
And then after tonight you changed my life, don't be surprised
TV on Oprah, broke down to my knees
Promoting my book about what you did to me

[Chorus]
When I'm on inside (Bottom of the ocean), oh
Girl it feels like (Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill
Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Had me in a coma all night (Bottom of the ocean)
Couldn't gotten robbed (Robbed)
Ooh, you got the sleeping pill (The sleeping pill)
Girl, you got that sleeping pill
When the morning inside (Bottom of the ocean)
Girl, it feels like (Swimming in slow motion)
I just took a sleeping pill
Oh, you got that sleeping pill (I want some more of that)
Had me in a coma all night (Bottom of the ocean)
So gone I couldn't gotten robbed
Ooh, you got the sleeping pill
Girl, you got that sleeping pill
Kinda love

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Since you've been gone
Well, I feel like I've been chewing on tinfoil
Since you've been gone
It's like I got a great big mouthful of cod liver oil
Oh well, I'm feelin like I stuck my hand
Inside a blender and turned it on
You know, I've been in a buttload of pain
Since you've been gone

(Since you've been gone)
I couldn't feel any worse if you dropped
A two-ton bowling ball on my toes
(Since you've been gone)
It couldn't hurt any more if you shoved
A red-hot cactus up my nose

Since you've been gone
Well, it feels like I'm getting tetanus shots every day
Since you've been gone
It's like I've got an ice cream headache that won't go away
Ever since that day you left me
I've been so miserable, my dear
I feel almost as bad as I did
When you were still here
Listen to the cat…
The bird says…
This is a dog…
The coyote goes…

Choose your weapon…
Choose your weapon…
Choose your weapon…
Choose your weapon…
Choose your weapon…

[Intro]
Follow my love, follow my love

[Chorus]
Drop into, drop into
Drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
Drop into this, drop into this
Drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo

[Verse 1]
The lines on your palm cry out to be cloaked
With the steady compass of my own
My constellations burn to be strung to yours
Almighty dot to dot

[Chorus]
So drop into this, so drop into this
So drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
So drop into this, honey help me swim right through this
So drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo

[Verse 2]
In this heat don’t doubt, I own the hour
White ocher shower
Howling as it falls to find the form
Of dust once more
In this heat don’t doubt, I own the hour
White ochre shower
Howling as it falls to find the form
Of dust once more
In this heat don’t doubt, I own the hour
White ochre shower
Howling as it falls to find the form
Of dust once more

[Bridge]
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine

[Chorus]
So drop into this, so drop into this
So drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
So drop into this, honey help me swim right through this
So drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo

[Verse 1]
Melt into the other world
Melt, melt
He saw my eyes turn gold and reptile
I'll dream tonight, bare and baptized
Bare and baptized
Coyote bones flex the muscle of animal spirit old
A bond so simple

[Chorus]
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline, in time, it all collides

[Verse 2]
After the coal has settled deep beneath ash resting
Quiet as silk the remedy tempers the willing
A ripe submergence of the highest order, no borders
After the coal has settled deep beneath ash resting
Quiet as silk the remedy tempers the willing
A ripe submergence of the highest order, no borders

[Chorus]
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline, in time, it all collides

[Verse 1]
Aftermath of the catch
Reeling in the secrets of the swamp
A motorcade harrowed and dapper underneath the surface
Founded, its talons curl they come to get you boy
Howling like...

[Chorus]
A toothless grinned swamp thing
Is lurking, come get you
Is lusting for your skin
Its hunger is climbing

[Verse 2]
A will-'O-wisp, a rum soaked ritual
Ravenous its cold stare is habitual
Send a message with fire smouldering across the lily pad
Saffron tears the sweetest you’ve ever had

[Chorus]
A toothless grinned swamp thing
Is lurking come get you
Come close dear, I could hold you
Safe in the water where the pressure
Crush you like pestle and mortar
Kiss your fever sleep forever

[Outro]
Forever
To sleep, to sleep
Forever

Baltimore

[Verse 1: Prince]
Nobody got in nobody's way
So I guess you could say it was a good day
At least a little better than the day in Baltimore
Does anybody hear us pray
For Michael Brown or Freddie Gray?
Peace is more than the absence of war
Absence of war

[Chorus: Prince & Eryn Allen Kane]
Are we gonna see another bloody day?
We're tired of the cryin' and people dyin'
Let's take all the guns away

[Verse 2: Prince]
Absence of war, you and me
Maybe we can finally say
Enough is enough, it's time for love
It's time to hear
It's time to hear the guitar play, guitar play
Baltimore, ever more

[Refrain: Prince]
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: Prince & Eryn Allen Kane]
Are we gonna see another bloody day?
We're tired of the cryin' and people dyin'
Let's take all the guns away

[Bridge: Prince]
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace

[Outro]
We have to interrupt the regular scheduled programming to bring you up to date on a developing situation in Los Angeles

[Chorus]
Broken memories
They taunt me like a bird caged by scorched wings
Puzzle pieces missing
All the grubby fingerprints that kissed the walls have vanished

[Verse]
Like the wind without her whisperings
And the colours wept from all her tapestries
Would be left nothing but sullen imagery
The uncertainty of forgotten things

[Chorus]
Broken memories
They taunt me like a bird caged by scorched wings
Puzzle pieces missing
All the grubby fingerprints that kissed the walls have vanished

[Outro]
The phoenix she dies with her wings burning
She sinks from the sky to the earth returning
But she will rise through ashes singing
With new wisdom she flies
With new wisdom she flies
With wisdom she flies to a new beginning
Dr. Jekyll that mister been buggin out my Hyde again
If he come in rapping on my door I’m not gonna answer it
I’ve been grieving old fashioned at the seed, my seam is fraying
I’ve been grieving old fashioned at the seed, my seam is fraying

Silk once rushed this thrust has rusted dry
Slip your flux right past your fortress
We all are born to die
We all are born to die

Lease this here now sweet piece of mind awake this light
Lease this here now sweet peace of mind
Always in flight
Diamond of a boy
Docile and wide eyed
And small in size
Stay warm
Tranquil a hymn of vermillion
Prince minikid i feed you water and seed from my lips
Sleeps through the day
Drunk on the fruit of symmetry
Sleep in my hair, a nest, your labyrinth
Lapse of myth
I found a babe to keep warm and safe
I found a babe to keep warm and safe

[Bridge]
Out over the edge you’ll find
Beads of laser fly
Out over the edge of time

A flint to strike down with the weather
And combat in full force

Abrasive the static
The grain of pixel equation
Erase speed, and forced heat
In 2D

[Chorus]
Atari sight

[Verse]
Direct to the old Navajo by the fire
Wish we were burn your design
Suede and hawk feather entwine me to the time
Arizona in June light
A bell that rings in the chest of story told
Meet you in this future bold
Sage at key point lead me to his funeral
A man lost young and old

[Outro]
Regret less the knot yes I give you the end to hold
Through darkness and earth wet I seek through the land to mould
A woman that rests night and day, sweat and tears unfold
To undress the burden that caress the blessed I’m told

Regret less the knot yes I give you the end to hold
Through darkness and earth wet I seek through the land to mould
A woman that rests night and day, sweat and tears unfold
To undress the burden that caress the blessed I’m told

Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head

[Verse]
Fill the lung that loves the phosphorescent absorbent time spent on few
And all of you, i'll offer myrrh and murder the preferred method of doubt that sways about
Heavy and unsound
I offer this smoke from you
Overrun from the mouth
You
The truth overrun from the mouth

[Chorus]
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down

Quick, quick to
Quick to lose, quick to lose your
Quick to lose your furrowed brow brow

[Verse 1]
Free range of the mind
Maps the fire coasting the sidelines
Contact with an ease
Tarnish point of the supreme
Is it the strength of your fearless over throwing your pain
You’ll see new heights you’ll be reaching
Is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake ripples your sweet fate
Free range of the mind
Maps the fire coasting the sidelines
Contact with an ease
Tarnish point of the supreme
Is it the strength of your feelings over throwing your pain
You’ll see new heights you’ll be reaching
Is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake ripples your sweet fate

[Verse 2]
In the death of the grip of the mask
That’s covering your simple love for the part
Of your soul so warm and vast
And I can hear the hinges struggle to last rusting
Feel my feathers rush from the past

[Chorus]
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
And then we fly away
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
And then we fly away

[Outro]
Hand in hand we fly away
Hand in hand

[Verse 1: Audra Mae]
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 2: Audra Mae]
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Bridge: Audra Mae]
Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this whole world
Is a new world
And a whole world for me

[Verse 3: Audra Mae]
Stars, when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yes, it's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good

This the type of thoughts for hours after the liquor store
Chemistry, let me into your energy

And I find us a rhythm making you quiver
It's so different I'm into your symbol like instrumental beats
Fall back, fall, I'mma leave for that son and go back

After all the love and passion girl, I gave it to you, babe
After all the pain I've endured girl, while I was with you, babe
Since that we're over babe, I could see your halo slipping babe
And it's all my fault, you were in it for my lifestyle, no more denying now

[Hook]
She said said she wanna be alone, so I left her in Hollywood
She wanna be amongst the stars, so I left her in Hollywood

All that she want, to see the bright lights in Vegas
Smoke 'til she's painless, she asked and I gave it
How can I deny? So I passed her a light
She's trapped in her mind, until she opened her eyes, eyes and recognise a real nigga
She was a drug, I'm rolling her up
Catching a buzz, off of her love
So many options, shawty got me sprung, body hot Bunsen
Girl make me go numb

[Hook]
Baby your body leaves me all hungover
Take my breath away, not a word or a verb
What happens here stays here
Out in Vegas yes

[Verse 2]
All that she want, was to make love in Paris
Take her right back to Vegas, and go half on a baby
How can I deny? So I passed her a light
She's trapped in her mind, until she opened her eyes, eyes and recognise a real nigga
Out where to start, drive the fancy cars, live the fast life, name in bright lights, name in bright lights
Take a gamble, what do you want? Something particular
Sip of Ciroc making you hot, shaking the atmosphere, yeah
Big as a dance floor, let her know my flow, oh she wants the bright lights

[Hook]

[Bridge]
All that she want, to see the bright lights in Vegas

Paying nothing but attention
While I'm making you moan
Tell you and your girls to come on

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It's you in the crowd, I'm watching you dance
I'm watching you dance, I love how you work it
If I'm allowed, let me use my hands
Let me use my hands, your energy's perfect

[Pre-Hook 2] + 

[Hook]

[Verse]
Roses, I bought a dozen roses, roses (when I say I love you I mean it)
I bought a dozen roses, roses, I bought a dozen roses, roses
I bought a dozen roses, roses, I bought a dozen roses, roses (I don't know, I don't know if I can do this)
I hope you're on your way
I bought a dozen roses (what do you mean? Tell me what you mean)
I've been waiting here all day (I know you say you love me, but what do you mean?)
I bought a (what do you mean? Yeah)

[Hook]
I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
It's been so long for me, I don't know how, by now
Been drowning in the sea of broken vows, by now
But I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now

[Bridge]
I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

[Verse 1]
Cause I'm supposed to be in love by now, by now
Well girl you stole my heart now take a bow, by now
In love by now
Well I'm supposed to walk you down the aisle, by now
Change your name and make your parents smile, by now
Leave the Church, make plans to celebrate, by now
A big old house and babies on the way, by now

[Bridge]
I've been chasing my dream, now I'm chasing you
Running hard but my legs feel weak
I done played every part, I done played a fool
Write the movie, I'll be your lead

[Verse 2]
Well I'm supposed to be in love today, by now
Go through my phone and throw 'em all away, by now
In love by now
Without your love, what would they say when they write my stories
Without your touch, I'll never know how it feels to fly
Drown in my emotions, now it's all on me
Eyes are finally open to love I couldn't see
Can't wait 'til I can say bless the day you landed in my arms

[Outro]
I'm supposed to be in love by now
I'm supposed to be in love by now
In love by now

[Verse 1]
These past few days, it's been a terrible house
Hold pain and it won't soon forget it
And we ain't got a broom, broken glass in every room
We're both to blame for it, I'm sure
But tell me one thing, if another man said your name
Would it still sound poetic?
If so fuck it then, don't really wanna live
Just call the cops on me

[Hook]
And tell 'em I'm jumping out of the window with my heart on fire
Flying fast as the wind goes as I chase the moonlight
Love grows like a crescendo and it take me high
So I'm jumping out of the window with my heart on fire, tonight

[Post-Hook]
Way up, way up
Way up, way up

[Verse 2]
These past 2 years we could fill up a room with tears
From the floor to the ceiling
We could feel the sun even through a thunderstorm
The floods won't reach the gates, I'm sure
The climb did changed now I'm carrying
Always rains but you still love the weather
If so fuck it then, don't really wanna leave
Just call the press on me

[Hook] + 

[Post-Hook]

[Bridge]
Now I'm jumping and falling and calling and screaming your name
Glasses and pieces I'm clearing it off of your veins
How many stories have fallen, where do I begin?
The damage is done, you can tell by the cuts in my skin
Ain't no running away from all of the painful things
If my heart is to 

[?] you know it'll leave a stain
I see your foot on the ledge, I know that you feel the same
Let's jump out of this window together

[Outro x2]
Jumping out of the window
Flying fast as the window goes for love

[Intro: Fabolous]
Foxx, Young OG (I hope you miss me when I'm gone)

Hit her with the beam jawn (I hope, I hope you miss me when I'm gone)

Oh you know now baby
Just like I'm working on the clock, you know I hit it on the dot

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
Girl I knew from the beginning (it was long gone now)
Get it once and that's the ending (no more, no more chasing you 'round)
Cause I remember in the summer (it was a different game)
Now you wanna be my lover, baby

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Oh you know now baby
You know I found your favourite spot, know I hit in on the dot
Oh you know now baby
Just like I'm working on the clock, you know I hit it on the dot

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Shawty hit it on the dot, she an infrared bone
Come out the blue with the red on
Put the Beats on you like the headphones
You still make me wanna head home
Used to run into you head on
Tried to live right but you dead wrong
Saying I'm close like that red zone
You know I hit that shit dead on, go 'head and get your regret on, gon'

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I hope, I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I hope, I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Girl I know, I know you gon' miss me when I'm gone

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
Oh you know now baby
You know I found your favourite spot, know I hit in on the dot
Oh you know now baby
Just like I'm working on the clock, you know I hit it on the dot
I hope a dozen
A dozen, a dozen

A dozen, a dozen

[Intro]
Pop the champagne and let it rain all over the world
Me and my girl about to do the twirl on the dance floor

[Verse 1]
Who told you to walk up to me with them Louboutin's so high?
Baddest bitch I've seen in my life, 'bout to make your boyfriend cry, make him cry baby
Lord knows, when you were sitting in front of your mirror at home
You knew that you were 'bout to get yours, why the hell you put that black dress on? It's so cold

[Hook]
It ain't my fault, just blame it on the dress that you bought
I blame it on the way that you walked in the club and stole my heart
It ain't my, ain't my fault
It ain't my, ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
You know you're wrong baby, but why would you bring him along then sneak and meet me in the bathroom stall?
Slide 'em to the side, don't take 'em all the way off
Lord knows, when you were sitting in front of your mirror at home
You knew that you were 'bout to get yours, why the hell you put that black dress on? It's so cold

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It ain't my fault, you know you wrong, it ain't my fault
You knew that dress was the baddest, as soon as you put it on
It ain't my fault, you know you wrong, it ain't my fault
If homie don't know he's leaving here alone, it's ain't my

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
If only there could be another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to

[Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah

[Verse 2]
Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life, you wouldn't have to change it

[Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah

[Bridge]
And I know just what I've got to do
And it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too

[Chorus]
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually

[Verse 1]
You said you didn't need her
You told her goodbye (goodbye)
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wish that you still had her (had her)
And you feel like such a fool

You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
(Gotta blame it on something)
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain

[Verse 2]
Should've told her you were sorry (sorry)
Coulda said you were wrong
But no, you couldn't do that
You had to prove you were strong
Oh, if you hadn't been so blinded (blinded)
She might still be there with you

You want her back again
But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
(Gotta blame it on something)
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Come on and blame it on the rain
'Cause the rain don't mind
And the rain don't care
You've got to blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain

(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
You can blame it on the rain
Blame it on the rain
Blame it on the rain, baby
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
Blame it, blame it on the rain

Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something

[Chorus]
Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
I got my mind made up
Come on, get in, get into it
To let it right
Yeah, tonight's tonight
Yeah, check it

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Relax yourself, and let your conscience be free
Get down to the sounds of the D-R-E
Cause tonight's tonight, I'll get in some shit (Yeah)
Deep cover, black tint MAN Hummer
Jams rock the whole summer
Stackin' his green while niggas get dumb and dumber
I headline, keep the shines
What's this surprise?
Got the D-O double-G applied to me with the dope rhyme

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Wake up to make up, wake up it's time to take up
More paper, it's Snoop and Dre who gettin' shake up
And take up, to hold you all for all my dogs
We hit you with that bang bang, boogie boogie y'all
Whether slidin' in your lo-lo, or smokin' on some do do
We're back in actions, spread the words, take some photos
Cause, we got more paper to get, pounds to get
I clowns the bitch, with pounds of shit, roll one nigga
Uhh, just what the Doctor ordered
It's the motherfuckin' father figure, I got a little older
And got a little wiser
But I still blast your ass with the 9 Mila-heat mind
Aww, and incase you think I'm slippin'
I'm dippin' with the bullet proof
Sun rise, wise up

[Hook: Dawn Robinson]
Ooh, his first mistake was he had to do the crime (Say what?)
He had to hustle mornin' to the night (That's right, hah)
(If), he would have known then (Yeah)
The things (Yeah) that he knows now
He might not have got that time in Wayside

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, it's me, white rag, cherry bently
Cop shines from Italy, speak money language fluently
Never fuck with the nastiest, flashiest
Bought a house, big as Scarface to show my happiness
Rack as the Six Zeros, for those who wanna get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal, rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spread a mill
Small bills, bring a smile to ta Ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue light a philly cause the judge has got a Free Willy
Salute with chill Rémy, gently
And escort four ladies an arm to Four Seasons after the club bentley
Condo suités, I'm fancy
Twenty floors up, overlookin' ladies, boomerang their panties
Bumpin' Snoop Dogg's latest, takin' trips to Las Dregus
That's how we do it, Snoop is on you

[Verse 4: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Niggas puffin' while they're stuffin' dope down their drawers
Niggas stackin' while we're jackin' nigga, all yours
Compound, locked down, Dogg Pound in a year
Decode comp-town is back with them L.B.C's
Eastside up, wide up, that's how as real
The Eastside family, D.P.G.C
I make a run for the buddah with a quarter of Hashie
In a Blue Century, toast in the back seat
Aboyed them, full the paranoid in them
Runnin' out gat some, mashin' with the hashins
Tryin' to get back to the big L.B.C
And when I do, young nigga sell me
All your dope, and all your robes
Cause Big Snoop Dogg ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Nigga

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Zoom zoom zoom, zoom zoom zoom
Repeat to fade

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Chorus: Miguel & Rod Stewart]
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow

[Intro: Ric Flair]
Woo, that's who's standing here today
The World's Heavyweight Champion
Only one, and you're looking
Oh knows I can't stand it
Now I gotta talk, we all gotta be quiet
Nikita Koloff, we've only just begun

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Boy floatin' down shit's creek
Who gon' need the paddle when the shit's deep?
We ain't Bobby Shmurda but the clique deep
Caught a body a week ago, we were this weak (Don't fuck with me)
Boy floatin' down shit's creek
Who gon' need the paddle when the shit's deep?
We ain't Bobby Shmurda but the clique deep
Caught a body a week ago, we were this weak
I just want it all, I just want it all
Even when I'm knowin' that ain't shit to you
I just pray to God, I just pray to God
Oh Lord, you done made my wrist weak
Jumpman, you could call me Air Jordan
Pullin' out the lot like I’m Jeff Gordon
We fuckin' Ric Flair on 'em
Pullin' out the chamber like a shareholder
I just got some mutherfuckin'
Puttin' bitches all up in a landcaster
Took a bitch and flew her out to South Beach
This is how you put a doll in a sand castle
Done know, we dumb blowed
I could live without a magazine cover
But shout out to my niggas from the XXL
All I need is, Magnum rubbers
But fuck the competition, let the sex sale

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Side diss, dog
You talkin' 'bout you fuckin my bitch, aw
Let's keep it real, I never eat your baby, mom
But boy I treat her like a side dish, dawg, don't get it fucked up

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Last time, I ain't had time for it
But today I got time for it
Nigga dressin' up in Tom Ford
Just to get that (clap, clap) like my dogs tryna encore
Oh my God, you a hater, nigga, on my mom
And no lie, I be on my job
A lot of niggas be jammed
When they talkin' but they don't want drama
We a different kinda sinister
Rollie presidential but the prime minister
Niggas got a chopper and a nine milliter
Liu Kang niggas acting fly finish' 'em, woo

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ric Flair, the bitches love me on my Ric Flair
Ric Flair, the bitches love me on my Ric Flair
Ric Flair, the bitches love me on my Ric Flair
Nigga, Ric Flair, yeah, the money long like my bitch hair

[Interlude: Rory Trustory]
All these bitches should know
All these niggas should know
All these bitches should know
All these niggas shit, done known, done known
All these bitches should know
All these niggas should know
All these bitches should know
All these niggas shit, done known, done known

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I'm sorry nigga, you forced it
Fuck it, just say you love it and forfeit
All my brothers goin' corporate
I see us #1 on this Forbes' list
My closet still covered in Jordan's
Still thuggin', still ruggin', niggas still can't fuckin' afford this
'Bout to pay the lawyers off for my nigga Kellz
We still talkin' like they're cell phones in his cell
I touchdown just like its NFL, then I'm in a SSL
Then I'm in a shawty named Vanessa cell
I'm pullin' off the SLS, sippin' VSOP
It got me stressin' and yes I'm callin' up the SOD's
Abbreviation talk, bang bang hate to talk
We pull up in matchin' cars 'cause we hate to walk
With more problems always comin' from this dope shit
Hoe shit, want to stop your whole cash flow shit
Put your feelings in the air, niggas wanna hold shit
Oh shit, hate the man the "open the door" shit
I'm only fuckin' with my nigga Sasha
A lot of niggas is some rich impostors
Thick woman whippin' pasta, plus sippin' vodka
Never fuck the money up, don't think this shit was flocka
Back when play was playback, you knew the kid from way back
We Maybach major, I got aggressive and lay back haters
But niggas ain't really ain't got nothing'against me
They just hate that paper, well, grat grat, take that hater
I think it's clear I hate the plateaus, and the platform
I bring it back like the Afros, ain't no platforms
And plus the plaque here, that's the young here
I'm ballin' like AND1 here
I'm offstage a bunch of white bitches yellin' fuck yeah
This for the niggas with no ambitions
This for the bitches with heart intentions and your commitments
You know we old school, since '02 with the pro-tools
We would scroll through, fresh niggas bustin' dope moves
Look, I heard you tellin' lies, shit was funny
These niggas disrespect the kid, I get they bitch to fuck me
If she miss out on fuckin' me, that bitch gon' miss the money just to love me
I treat you niggas like some distant cousins
Don't give a fuck who make the XXL cover
Fuck the competition with some XXL rubbers
Heard them birds chirpin', they some next Nextel brothers
Niggas try to hate, I had to check check tail brothers
Y'all know, I'm so original like old school and Nike checks
I fuck the game up then I fuck your wifey next
I'm so serial, I eat these niggas up for cereal
I'm talkin' life, checks
Nigga, you don't understand, boy
We can go O for O, hoe for hoe, check for check
Dawg, we can go bad bitch, slut, head, neck for neck
Nigga, we ain't never gon' be neck to neck, dawg

[Verse 1]
Neon lights on the dust on the ground on the bus
Dirty roads makes that scarf wrap a must
Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app
Data mine my mind like a diamond in the ruff

[Hook]
A platform here's a train of thought
Getting to the right side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what I really got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not
Guns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run
Guns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run
Guns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run
Guns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run

[Verse 2]
If oil is the god then the cranes all pray
The crude is so rude
Coz it makes the people pay
On the side of the road men make money
A flower for a dollar man
He wants a family
If I rose to power
It'll be a bouquet
Emoji a smiley
And say your ok
The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day
And talking is cheap
Coz they make it easy

[Hook]
A platform here's a train of thought
Getting to the right side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what I really got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

[Bridge]
Guns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run
Those who love heat, yeah here comes the sun
Power to the people yeah the light is never done
Switch on for the bitches yeah electricity bun

[Hook]
A platform here's a train of thought
Getting to the right side of me is why I fought
I'm gonna say what I really got
Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not

Intimidated
Gee, I'm a nerd
Seen each Star Trek eighty times
Memorized each word

Home alone
On Friday nights
But I got eight gigabytes
Left on my hard drive

I'm hooked as I can get
Into the Internet
Maybe you would like to see my web page

I love my new PC
It means the world to me
So many things to download

Gee, I'm a nerd
All the jocks and muscle heads
Flip me the bird
Cause I'm a nerd
Gee, I'm a nerd

[Intro]

[Chorus]
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song (Oh, yeah, yeah)
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known (Oh, yeah)
When you smiled, you smiled (Oh)
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules

[Chorus]
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

[Verse 2]
We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car, if we choose
Mr. "Born to Lose"

[Chorus]
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

[Bridge]
There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
Fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought nor found you
Everything you do is elusive
To even your honey dew

[Chorus]
Our honeymoon

[Outro]
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Hmm, mmm
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Hmm, hmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
You been down with me since I first started
No love for a friend, baby girl cold-hearted
I know it's really hard to believe
But fuck her with the shoe, I probably would never succeed
On my knees, beggin', 'Please' for the Lord to forgive me
I tried to bounce, but your spirit had bit me
I'm drinkin' the Remy, killin' niggas, squeezin' the semi
Ridin' 'round in a Cutlass, shit, I need me a Bentley
I missed bail cause of you, nigga, went to jail cause of you
Trialed niggas in my cell cause of you
I squeeze shells cause of you, I wouldn't tell cause of you
Even probably brought my ticket down to hell cause of you
Damn, look, see, I'm knowin' that I'm 'posed to shake
But anytime I leave you, I'm feelin' my heart ache
Hope you feelin' my vibe, holmes
Nah, not a chick, I mean the shit that you drive, holmes

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Livin' a double life, havin' double shots of Patrón
With my mistress 'stead of my wife, I was on
Like the switch in my Marriott, can we get married, Dot?'
I fucked her three times, then I was gone, apparently not
Story of the 80–20 rule is me
Movin' cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat
Way back, her perfume on my white tee
Ignorin' calls from my wifey
See, I was dead wrong, but was tryin' to get a nut
And she had some great dome
Like the New Orleans Saints when they're playin' at home
What's a nigga to think? Oh, just throw away some pussy
Then my conscious called me, 'Pussy'
You don't understand, mama had ass
And I'm quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man...
I never thought of the day I would quit
Till I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart

[Intro: Meek Mill]
When I say weakass, you say bitch
Weakass bitch, weakass bitch
I don't want no basic bitches, basic bitches
I don't want no basic bitches, wait a minute motherfucker

[Hook: Meek Mill]
White niggas be talkin' hard
Talkin' shit till we pull your card
Take your chain, beat you up
Fuck your bitch, clean you up
My niggas wylin', we wylin' wylin'
My niggas wylin', we be wylin', we wylin' wylin'
My niggas wylin', we be wylin' we wylin', wylin'
My niggas wylin'
And I don't want no basic bitches

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
She ain't never fuck with a rich nigga
She told me that her ex was a bitch nigga
So I told her put me on the 'Gram though
Just to flex on that nigga with some real killers
And now he on my line talkin' reckless
I'm thinkin', should I slide or should I check him?
But I ain't goin' to war bout no pussy though
But if you tryna you get wet then
Runnin' with my niggas on the low-low
We in the south side, talkin' mafioso
I be really outside, bustin' with my four-four
Right there on the south side, watching for the po-po
Sharper than a motherfucker
We gettin' money like a motherfucker
She suckin' dick for Red Bottoms
You bet some bitches call 'em bloodsuckers
Get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I know exactly what Meek talkin' bout
I took your basic ass ho and then I nut on her mouth
Broke niggas you can stand to the left
Rich niggas to the right with their pistols out
Playin' with a cat, got her whiskers out
Got 'Rari's and Bentleys, and Fiskers out
Hold up, what the fuck this nigga talkin' bout?
Yo, Takeoff, pull the Mac-11 out
Young niggas wylin', 12 o'clock on a Friday
Pull up like Big Worm, I want my money Friday
And you can have your basic bitches
Because my hoes' siddity with fat ass and titties

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Takeoff, I make the work disappear like a magician
Take that envy then stand in the kitchen, whip me up a chicken
I beat that pot like a chemist, money bat-bat like it's tennis
And free my niggas in penitentiaries, they locked in the system
I pray the Lord is my witness, nigga, I'm stackin' them benjis
Ever since they killed Pistol Pete my nigga, I turned to a menace
And all these diamonds around my neck, I put on two of them chinchillas
Drop my top in the winter, cash out at the Beverly Center
Go to my jeweler out in Cuba, get diamonds below temperature
Double cup my muddy trouble, I'm an Actavis citizen
Bitches run around the lobby, boot 'em up, but no Timberlands
Your bitch pull up to my trap with no call
Like football she get penalties

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Cloud nine, where you can find me and my dime
Like Roosevelt in his prime, wait till I'm in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool
But the irony is I can hold the bottom of an iron
With the bottom of my palm
I say so much so little, all action, no talk
Like a mime throwin' up gang signs
It's not all about punchlines, I don't do that
I'm a jaguar, you just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aimin' for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still like a petty theft
I will conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsey got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me cause we all ate cereal
Humped the momma friend daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shoppin' carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school, here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no fussy-ass A&R or TEO
We ain't what you think and you think we back
But we been here for decades and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that
Speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watchin' enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feelin' froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'm a get when I see your suicide

[Hook]
Too hot to handle, too dope to hold
Two dope boys, we roll deep, everybody gather your seats
We goin' to cloud nine, we comin' back in a week
And the weak good riddance
Only the strong permitted to ride and test drive
With Kendrick the Jedi
One of a kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters, I tell 'em, 'Hi', enemies, I don't tell 'em shit but puta
Click, booyah, click, click

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call ?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Chorus: Sam Smith & John Legend]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Outro: Sam Smith & John Legend]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou

[Verse 1]
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I am not the enemy
It isn't me, the enemy

[Chorus]
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

[Verse 2]
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below

[Chorus]
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?

[Intro: Andy]
This one goes out
From the bottom of our hearts
To the most important lady in our lives
It's time to pay some respect
I hope you proud of us
'Cause we're proud of you

[Chorus: Andy, Akiva & Jorma]
Mama! You raised me right
Mama! Showed me the light
Mama! Through pain and strife
Mama! You gave us life

[Verse 1: Jorma, Akiva, Andy]
When I fell down you were there to pick me up
When I felt bad you were there to build me up
Gave everything you had in the world to me
And you made me the man I'm supposed to be
Jane, even though I don't say it often enough
I appreciate everything you did for us
Never take you for granted 'cause it ain't hard to see
The best parts of you are now a part of me
Ah Mama

[Pre-Chorus: Andy, Akiva & Jorma]
And when it was cold outside
You kept us warm and held us down—

[Interlude 1]

[Mom] Hi boys, who wants a snack?

[Andy] Mom, get out we're in the studio!

[Jorma] Oh my God

[Mom] Just checking on my guys

[Jorma] Get out of here!

[Andy] We're making a track, you idiot!

[Mom] Oh

[Andy] Just leave!

[Mom] Okie Dokie

[Jorma] Go! Go!

[Andy] You suck, mom!

[Verse 2: Jorma, Akiva]
Yeah, my one true love, my heart, my ma
Showing her respect in the form of this song
So when life gets hard and it makes you cry
I'll always be there to wipe a tear from your eye
My mom's my number one fan, my best friend
And I'll never disrespect—

[Interlude 2]

[Jorma] Mom!

[Mom] I know you said you weren't hungry, but I made ants on a log

[Andy] Get the fuck out!

[Jorma] Leave! Leave! Leave! Go!

[Mom] So how's your little club going?

[Andy] Not a club!

[Jorma] It's a rap group!

[Mom] Well I'll leave these here and eat them if you—

[Jorma] Fine!

[Andy] Go to hell, Mom!

[Verse 3: Andy]
She's an angel on earth with invisible wings
I put no one above in summer, winter or spring, or fall—

[Interlude 3]

[Mom] Have you guys seen the remote?

[Andy] Oh my God!

[Jorma] Leave us alone!

[Andy] Fuck you mom!

[Jorma] Leave us alone!

[*window smashes*]

[Mom] Watch it

[Andy] I hope you fucking die!

[Verse 4: Jorma, Akiva]
Jump in front of a bullet if it could save my mom
You got a gun or a bullet 'cause she will never see harm—

[Interlude 4]

[Mom] Nevermind, I found it

[They all scream/shout/glass smashes]

['Dale'] Laura, everything ok?

[Andy] Shut the fuck up, Dale!

[Jorma] Shut up!

[Mom] Hey! Be nice to Dale

[Andy] Fuck Dale!

[Jorma] Fuck Dale! I can't believe you have sex with that guy!

[Outro: Andy, Akiva & Jorma]
This goes out to all the mamas
Trying to protect their kids from drama
Love was your goal to bring
No matter what they say, you're beautiful
So push them lighters in the sky
Wave 'em back from side to side
And if you feel lost and alone
Let our voices guide you home

[Mom] Is something burning down there?

[Andy] Get the fuck out now!

You know the deal, domino, money - no friends
All I ever wanted was a little action
Especially back in the day when I didn't have shit
Feelin' like shit, get treated like shit
Now I'm changing to be deceiver postic
Life's a bitch, fucks with your head
I'm a man need to get tree(3) to work respect
But I'm getting bullshit, I'm trying to calm my temper
When I do good, don't wanna man buff
When I do bad, no one forgets

Made myself rich cause I'm too proud to beg

But Ninja's a most cooler ruler than Zuma
Ninja's a most meaner leader than Malema
Fuck a racist makin' the same mistake all over again

Good luck to all those that hate me
Hack you like a dark fuckin' knight

[Spoken Monologue]
This is The Manifesto of Mother Monster
On G.O.A.T, a Government Owned Alien Territory in space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite
As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment
But boundless freedom
But on that same day, as the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place... the birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered, "How can I protect something so perfect without evil?"

[Intro]
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride

[Verse 1]
Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini
Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky
All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues because we like to keep it freezy
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time
So let's ride

[Chorus]
(Vroom, vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom, vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom, vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me

[Verse 2]
Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah, I'm so bossy
Speedin' like Alonso just to crash your party
People are goin' loco when I'm pullin' up, takin' your papi
Don't think about consequences 'cause they're never gonna stop me, what?

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time

Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Know they can't catch me
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Too slow, too slow

(*laughing*) Oh, hello

I don't know who're you talking about)
EMINEM, YOU FUCKING BITCH!

[Intro]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the fuck outta here

[Hook]
You see I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me

[Verse 1]
You might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Or leaning out a window with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue-and-red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should've been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fucking brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What is this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots
In public, I'mma love it

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just...

[Dialogue: Eminem & Sculptor]
*Dial tone*

(Hello?) Hello? (Yes)
Hi, is this Curtis (Yes, it is) Hi, Curtis
(Hi) Hi, this is Curtis, I'm Curtis
My name is Curtis also (Oh, my name is Kurt)
Oh, that's really funny (Okay)
(That's okay) Um, listen, I was wondering
I was looking at your ad in the paper, um
I was wondering, you-you, you do sculptures? (Yes)
Okay, um, you're gonna laugh, um
This is kinda personal, but
I'm, um, a transsexual
And I was wondering if, um, you could-
Are you there? (Yes) Ok, I'm s-I'm sorry
I thought you was gonna laugh at me, um
I was wondering, um, how much would charge, to like, um
Sculpt, like-like, if-if-if you were to make like, um
A sculpture of my body (Well, that's not what I do
I work in the steel and...)
You couldn't make a-a sculpture of, like um
My body **cellphone ring** (No) Okay, um
(It's not what I do, I-ah) Okay, you're yelling at me
(No, I'm not) Oh, I'm-I'm sorry
I thought you were, I thought you were yelling at me
(My phone is louder) Oh, ok (But, uh)
It sounds very loud in my ear
(Just to be, make it very clear, what I do) Uhuh
(Is geometrics) Oh (So)
What exactly is geometrics? (Well)
Cause I was trying to get like, just-
All I really wanted- you're probably gonna laugh, but
All I really wanted was, um, a sculpture, really
Of my penis, just for my girlfriend (That's not what I do)
(I don't know what to tell you, but, uh)
You can't make a sculpture of my penis?
The- Just (It's not what I do, sir)
Just my penis, that's it, just the head of my penis
(No, that's not what I do) (*laugh*) (Okay?) What?
Why don't make sculptures of penises?
(Well) This is (it's-it's-it's not I'm in- First of all)
You're being mean, sir, 'cause you put an ad in the paper
(No, I didn't, I put an ad in fo-)
You put an ad in the paper for penis sculptures!
This is really messed up, you're doing psychological damage to me
Physically and mentally
(You know, I have your phone number, by the way
So don't make obscene phone calls) I'm not making obscene *phone ringing* phone call
I'm being dead serious with you sir (Well I can't do that)
And you're making fun of me (I can't do that for you)
Is that a business you run there? (I put an ad in for trucking)
You're scaring me, what? Trucking? (Yes, you looked under "trucking")
(I don't have an ad for-) I thought I looked under "fucking"
Oh my god, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, goodbye

[Verse 1: Mac Demarco]
How's your heart been beating?
How's your skin been keeping?
How's the dream been going since you've came back home this time?
You left her out there somewhere
Told her how you feel but
Never really got the chance to show her what it really means to love her

[Chorus]
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

[Verse 2: Mac Demarco]
Closer to the ending
She's still out pretending
Prying eyes won't recognize the way she feels about him
She'll just go on living
The river keeps on rolling
Knowing all the time she'll never understand just what it means to love her

[Chorus]
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

[Chorus]
Love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her
I am a pop artist. So my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas

'I’m sorry' is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say 'You shouldn't have to be sorry for your opinions ...' George Bush ... has some very cool self portraits. I didn't know he was an artist!

I felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored, a humanization of a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sat there 

[in the audience Monday], kind of shaking a little bit, is I need to get rid of that feeling, I need to not be nervous

This honor is going to make your lives easier, for two reasons: You don’t have to defend me as much! And I’m going to make all of our lives easier. It is these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I have been saying my entire life – whether it was the sign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, 'It's OK, he doesn't bite,' or the New York Times cover, or the Time (magazine) most-influential cover. And now a doctorate at the School of the Art institute of Chicago

When I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school, because when I went on a mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier to have just said I had a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago! Thank you

Questions from the crowd:

Can I give you a hug? When are you going to open a school? What does Chicago mean to you? Can we hang out later? Do you wanna build a snowman?

I say I wanna build a snowman because I want Bob Iger, the head of Disney, to invest in my ideas. Not one idea, not a good idea, or even a bad idea — a series of them. But just in my ideas...I feel Disney should have an art fund that completely supports all of the artists and...I feel there should be a responsibility
Prof. Nick Cave: Kanye, you join us today to be recognized for your transformative, genre-defining work across music, performance, film, and fashion design. Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. West

Dr. Kanye West: I’m sorry, that was just my opinion

I am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas

“I’m sorry” is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush… has some very cool self-portraits. I didn’t know he was an artist

I felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is “I need to get rid of that feeling.” I need to not be nervous

This honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don’t have to defend me as much, and I’m gonna make all of our lives easier. And it’s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I’ve been saying my entire life. Whether it’s the cosign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, “It’s okay, he doesn’t bite white people,” or the New York Times cover, or the Time “Most Influential” cover, and now a doctorate at The Art Institute of Chicago

When I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school because when I went on that mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier if I could have said: "I have a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago."

Thank you

[Chorus]
We can talk by the river
We can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me
Ah ah

[Verse]
So you're at a low
Your speeding heart is getting slow
The music fades before your mind
You hold her hand and whisper, "Man, man,"
"Man, it feels like space again"
Your saw her face and then she cries
The River Styx is getting wide
The Brooklyn wastes and rolling waves
And Jesus says, they both say

[Chorus]
We can talk by the river
We can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me
Ah ah
We can talk by the river
We can walk right out to the sea
I haven't talked much lately
Maybe that's why you never talk to me
Ah ah

[Outro]
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know
It took him all his life to know

[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Standing here, all at once
All the words run dry
Something's changed, can't explain
And I can't deny

[Pre-Chorus 1: Trey Songz]
Turning in circles and blurring the lines of the unspoken
It's calling us tonight

[Chorus: Both]
I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Close your eyes, when you dream
That's where I will be
Say it's true (It's true)
Say you do (I do)
Say you do believe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Both]
The greatest adventures are waiting so patiently
The angels are calling us tonight

[Chorus: Both]
I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Every shape and all the colors
All the love from all the lovers
Never could express just what you mean to me
Turning in circles and blurring the lines
Every word in every sentence
Doesn't seem to make a difference
Nothing can explain just what you mean to me

[Chorus: Both]
Oh, no, I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Outro: Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez]
Every star that's ever fallen
Knows the way to where we're going
Now I really know just what you mean to me

[Hook 1:]
Please don't hate me
This ain't personal
I just wanted something that I never had
Please don't hate me
This ain't personal
I just wanted something that I never had
Please don't want  me
This ain't personal
I just needed something that I never had
And just something that I never had
Just something that I never had
Give me something that I never had

[Verse 1]
He said
Sins of the father fall on the fins of the father swimmer
Then my son is going to Jannah
Nah, don't get off topic nigga, found this in your pocket nigga
I ain't trying to get on science or rockets with you bitch
I've been rocking with you since it was little or nothing
Rhythm adjusting to say your mental vision to someone
Criminal customs still remain, you broken law
Open a broken jaw, say you ain't going to wow
Yeah she stands here holding your smoking sour
To her big as the while spent that you were small as a locked pitching
Till we losing respect for a pocket picker prediction
New York will celebrate if the Knicks win
And then we'll hesitate and the Benz lens
Try shooting a gun from this end
This and that fics and facts and is missing, twisting, denying, amplifying
But there's science behind my diamonds bitch, gone

[Hook 2:]
Please don't hate me
This ain't personal
I just wanted something that I never had
Please don't want me
This ain't personal
I just needed something that I never had
And just something that I never had
Just something that I never had
Give me something that I never had

[Verse 2:]
She said
Pins of the mother falling on chest of a doll of a cheating nigga
Simultaneously is breathing with it
Is comfortable you see as slippers
We agree to better eat and now that evil vengeance visiting eating with her
Eating dinner, dinner being the inner Eden in her
Anything to get back at that nigga
Her ain't eating any of the bean dinner, dinner eating her with Eden
Visiting vengeance evil her at eating bitter
The 

[?] wee slippers in seating comfortable with his breathing he simultaneously
Nigga
Cheatin', furthermore repeating
Furthermore repeating
Repeatedly cannonballing off in the deep end
If walking off is your defense
Then walling off your reasons
From all the talk is indecent
I bought this doll from a priestess
If you been feeling awfully nauseous said recent that's the reason bitch, gone

[Hook 3:]
Please don't want  me
This ain't personal
I just needed something that I never had
And just something that I never had
Just something that I never had
Give me something that I never had

[Verse 3:]
And he can't talk yet
Sippy cup sit on sofa beside the shoe of a trusted sitter
Overhearing the bitter
Over here by the mirror was little man making pictures
Hitting his firetruck with one of his action figures
Looks and sees a bird, by the open window he ventures
Contemplates, then enters
Or exit, crawls out on to the ledges
The bird that he once seen is now move closer to the edges
He pursues it but his balance starts to lose it
So he slips and then he falls into a car driving by roofless
In the back seat with no scratches
Driver caught up in the music so he didn't hear him enter we he fell down cause that stupid bitch
Was so caught up in Revenge
Too busy sticking in her pins
Luckily he landed in the back of his daddy's Benz
But he was on his way to go and cheat again

[Hook 4:]
Please don't hate me
This ain't personal
I just wanted something that I never had
Please don't want me
This ain't personal
I just needed something that I never had
Please don't hate me
This ain't personal
I just wanted something that I never had

[Intro]
We got London on da Track

[Chorus]
First you get that money, then you get that power
If he tune his nose up, boy, he on that powder

Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser

[Chorus]
First you get that money, then you get that power
If he tune his nose up, boy, he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers

If I got legs, bitch you know I'm gonna get it
She got good head, so she welcome to my Bentley
Big bid-ness in that big Bentley, Bentley (What? What?)
Ridin' 'round with that semi, 'cause I know these niggas envy (Hah)
Is you mad 'bout Instagram or how I kick my pimpin'? (Pimp)
You keep that Ace of Spades, I'm sippin'

[Chorus]

[Intro]
A lotta people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lotta people think that what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal
You're goddamn right
Yeah, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail, get it? Checking the 'male'?"
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
And to think, it's just little old me
Mr. "Don't Give a Fuck" still won't leave

[Hook]
I'm a criminal! 'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal! 'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as-
I dropped my 1st album Traphouse ten years ago May 2005 I remember being proud and angry the day it was released.
I was proud of the work I put in and the quality of the project but I was angry that someone had to be killed over a dispute about the rights to some of the contents of the album.
10 years later I reflect on how that day impacted my life and my legacy and I am grateful for all the fans that supported me then and still support me now.
Every challenge and obstacle in my life has helped me to become who I am today and provided me with the tests to display my resilience.
I hope my life showed someone somewhere that if you endure the storm you will eventually get your chance to shine.
I never give up and I have grown and learned so much and still am eager to learn more.
I look forward to showing the world how much I have grown and getting out and helping my community.
I have been blessed with the opportunity to be a recording artist and help others get their chance to be heard.
To my fans I love you all and I want you all to know I am motivated and will not let my past decide my future.
I chose to not focus my attention on my negativities but on my dreams.
I will keep on hurdling and keep on hustling. My liabilties I turn to assets and even my inconsistincies make me the unique person I am.
I am focused and I will be returning soon very soon so get ready.
If I had to change anything in the last 10 years I would not change one thing.
Sincerely Guwop!

Hey, I fuck her, treat her like a Maverick, leave her in the dirt

Thugger, hey!

[Verse 1]
This a letter to my slimes, what's brackin' slimes?
I had your back every single last fuckin' time
And you know I'm the only one who's gon' die 'bout you
And you know in Pluto I can stand side to side with you
I'm livin' every week like it's my birthday week
I can be a birthday freak
Bitch, I'm working while you lurkin' me
I'm in the street like it's my worst week
My bitch boolin' and she say she want that Birkin B
Ma asked was my purpose, then

[Chorus]
Mama say I ain't have no choice but to do my mothafuckin' thing
Got my shoes, I tied 'em up and made a whole 'nother lane
My diamonds shining, they glistenin', but they ain't from Johnny fuckin' Dang
You say her cat was terrific and I said the same damn thing

[Verse 2]
Same damn time
These bitches and these niggas wanna see a nigga dead
Damn why's that? Spam that shit nigga
I'm dumpin' on your bitch
No Donald, I'll Trump that bitch
Ho say it again, say it again
Kush smell like a skunk
Bitch, I'm fresher than a punk

[Bridge]
Okay, now tell me how you want it (What!?)
You know that I got it (What!?)
Big booty ho from Houston
I bang red like a Rocket
Okay, well she done been around you
I know all about her
I wanna put a eight-ball in her corner pocket

[Verse 3]
I just read her diary, went and bought her that Mercedes
No cop car, she a Taurus
Yeah, that "T", that mean she taken
She don't feel right 'til she play me
She won't take my bread, no baby
And just for that, I would love to keep her
She keep going 'round like an equator
I'll introduce her to paper
Bitch, it's a bando, it’s vacant
I bought ice just for my acres
Damn, there go a superstar, no shaker
Hey, I grab that pistol and erase 'em

[Chorus]
Mama say I ain't have no choice but to do my mothafuckin' thing
Got my shoes, I tied 'em up and made a whole 'nother lane
My diamonds shining, they glistenin', but they ain't from Johnny fuckin' Dang
You say her cat was terrific and I said the same damn thing

[Outro]
You feel the same way 'bout it, you feel the same way
I swear I’ll catch me a body, these niggas try to play
You know I'm rich, but ain't make you the girl in the same day
You know I don't care about cheese on my head like Green Bay
No way, José (Yah)
You like my motherfuckin' fate today (Ohh)
I might catch her ‘round the way, stray and save the day
Put that dick inside her she stuck, she stuck like clay
(Yah, yah)

I am focused and I will be returning soon very soon so get ready. If I had to change anything in the last 10 years I would not change one thing. Sincerely Guwop!

Its Guccciiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" - Gucci Mane

[Verse]
I gave my world away
A million rainy days
Such a shame in a way
And no one else alive
Sacrificed everything
A million broken dreams
And I don't want to stay
I did it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
The stars all rise
The moon won't shine
The stars fall out of the sky
And I could be your guiding light
All through the night
All through your life

[Chorus]
I'll be gone before you know it
Long, long, gone

[And now the world is spinning]
Like the sun
And now the day is burning
I don't mind
Spending some time on my own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well, then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault 'cause you both deserve
What's coming now, so don’t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & (Mary J. Blige)]
If you needed love (Needed love), well, then ask for love (Ask for love)
Could have given love (Given love), now I’m taking love (Taking love)
And it’s not my fault (Not my fault) 'cause you both deserve (Both deserve)
What's coming now (Coming now) so don’t say a word

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad
I don't feel so bad

[Bridge: Adam Levine & (Mary J. Blige)]
I'm so sorry, darling (Ooh-ooh)
Did I do the wrong thing? (Do the wrong thing)
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige, (Mary J. Blige)]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore? (Don't you care)
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall (Six foot tall)
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
(Shoot him dead)
He won't come around here anymore (Come around here)
Come around here? I don't feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore? (Don't you care?)
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here, I don't feel so bad

[Outro: Adam Levine & Mary J. Blige]
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
(Don't you care, don't you care?)
Don’t you care about me? I don't think so

[Verse 1]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Bridge]
Tuesday afternoon is never-ending
Wednesday morning the papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings sure need mending
See how they run

[Verse 2]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
I wonder how you ever manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think the money was heaven sent?

[Bridge]
Tuesday afternoon is never-ending
Wednesday morning the papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings sure need mending
See how they run

[Verse 3]
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Doo-doo-doo-doo

Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Ooh

[Outro]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Tuesday afternoon is never-ending
Wednesday morning the papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings sure need mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna
If you see me sliding
Say we're gonna slide together

If you see me hiding
Tell me I can hide forever

Come
With me now
As now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

When my clouds are crying
Say you're gonna change my weather

If you hear me lying
It's never when we lie together

Come
With me now
As now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun
If you see me sliding
Pray that I won't slide forever

If you see me hiding
Say that we can hide together

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

Your sun (x16)
I caught you knockin'
At my cellar door
I love you, baby
Can I have some more
Ooh, ooh, the damage done
I hit the city and
I lost my band
I watched the needle
Take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done
I sing the song
Because I love the man
I know that some
Of you don't understand
Milk-blood
To keep from running out
I've seen the needle
And the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's
Like a settin' sun

[Intro]
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath with out my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

I've been tossing and turning all night
Staring into the darkness
Afraid to turn on the light
It's got nothing to do with money
I just sure enough want you, honey
And I just can't rest
Till I get it right
'Cause when the morning breeze
Starts blowing
That's when you hear me call your name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious, baby
End of the game

'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love

You got me walking round in circles
Yeah I'm always pacing the floor
'Cause this life I'm living without you
I just can't take no more
When the morning breeze starts blowing
I can hear you call my name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious, baby
End of the game

'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love

'Cause when the morning breeze
Starts blowing
I can hear me call your name
That's when my love starts showing
It's getting serious, baby
End of the game

'Cause I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love
I said I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough of your love
You know that it will be untrue
You know that it will be a liar
La la la la la la la la...
Before we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on, fire
The time of two is our own soul
No time to war in the mire
But darling we can only learn
While other people flail on fire
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Come on baby light my fire
Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Aah, Backstreet
Yes yes y'all
One time, here we go (yes yes y'all)
Ooh, ooh (2X)
Yes yes y'all
I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And about by the way that you moved
I couldn't help the way I stared
There were some mysterious force
Leading me here to you
Lead me (lead me) to you (to you)
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotised
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
And I was lost in your world with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Chorus:
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be
Let's get it on (let's get it on)
Jam all night long
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ
Will you play it for me?
Ooh, ooh (2X) (yes yes y'all)
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
Every move that your body makes
Only makes me want you more
And it seems like time's moving fast
How can we make it last?
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)
As we keep on dancing
I am hypnotised
By the rhythm of your body
And the music in your eyes
Ooh, ooh...
Chorus
Close your eyes
And imagine us alone
Let the music put you in the zone
I am lost, lost inside a rhythm
When you do the things you do
Come on and work your body, work your body
Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me
(2X)
Chorus to fade
Keep it coming Mr. DJ... (repeat to fade)
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows
Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

(Instrumental break)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's that and she knows
I think that she knows
(Instrumental break)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh (repeat 2 more times)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I don't ask for too many things
Only one thing I really need
That is you, baby, next to me
With that I'm satisfied
Don't need diamonds, I don't need gold
I just need someone here to hold
To keep me warm when the nights are cold
That would do just fine, just fine

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me love, inside your heart
And that's enough
Baby, that's enough

[Chorus]
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time, yeah yeah
(All your heart)
All your soul, baby, that's enough
Nothing else that I need
Give me you, give me you
That's enough for me, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
I don't need things that money buys
All I need is there in your eyes
I just need your heart next to mine
All my whole life through

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to bring the moon to me
Just bring me the love
The love that I need
And that's enough
Ooh baby, that's enough

[Chorus]
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time, yeah yeah
(All your heart)
All your soul, baby, that's enough
Nothing else that I need
Give me you, give me you
That's enough for me, baby

[Bridge]
You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me that I have your heart
You don't have to bring the world to me
Just give me your word, you will never leave
'Cause having you beside me, I have everything I need
So give me, give me you

[Chorus]
(Give me you)
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need, oh
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time, yeah
(All your heart)
All your soul, baby, that's enough
That's enough, nothing else that I need
(Give me you)
Give me you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need, oh
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time, yeah
(All your heart)
All your soul, baby, that's enough
That's enough, nothing else that I need

[Outro]
Give me you

It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child

[Verse 1]
Today you had a visitor
Or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute
That's not where it ends, no
Is there something
That you wanna tell me
'Cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend
And girlfriend
She wasn't disrespectful
In fact, she's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours

[Chorus]
She said it's your child
And it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood
Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

[Verse 2]
She said she never wanted to hurt me
And could I understand, she's afraid and alone
She said a real woman wouldn't do this over the phone
And that you told her about me after the baby was born, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend
And girlfriend
She wasn't disrespectful
In fact, she's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours

[Chorus]
She said it's your child
And it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood
Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

[Verse 1 repeated]
Today you had a visitor
Or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute
That's not where it ends, no
Is there something
That you wanna tell me
'Cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend
And girlfriend (In fact)
And girlfriend (And how can I argue with her)

She said it's your child

How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood

Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

It's your child
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm

We may not have a cent
To pay the rent
But we're gonna make it
We may have to eat beans everyday
But we're gonna make it
And if a job is hard to find
And we have to stand
In the welfare line
I've got your love
And I know you got mine
And we're gonna make it

We may not have a home
To call our own
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
We're gonna make it, I know we will
'Cause togetherness
Brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all of the time
I've got your love
And you know you've got mine
And we're gonna make it
I know we will
The car may be old
Our two rooms cold
But we're gonna make it
And though we can't spare

A roach a crumb
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
And if I have to carry around a sign
That says, "Help the deaf
The dumb and the blind"
I've got your love
You know you've got mine
We're gonna make it
I know we will

We may not have a home
Just to call our own
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
But we're gonna make it
I know we will
'Cause togetherness
Brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all of the time
I've got your love
You know you got mine
We're gonna make it
I know we will
We're gonna make it

We're gonna make it, baby
I know we're gonna make it, baby

[Verse 1]
Hope you're not thinking you ain't the one
Seems you're annoyed by my voice
'Cause you're out there trickin' 'til five in the morning
I don't play that shit
(Oh) Hope you're not thinking you can just leave
Homeboy, please
From the tone of my voice
I know that you can see I don't play that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
(No, no, no)
I ain't low on self esteem
(No, no, no, no, no)
Other girls don't strike fear in me
I work this relationship nine to five
And I deserve overtime
So you can say what you want
Stay gone long as you want
You ain't leaving me, you ain't leaving me
You can say what you want
Stay gone long as you want
You ain't leaving me, you ain't leaving me (oh)

[Chorus]
So I'ma stick around, stick around
'Til I get a return on my investment
All of the nights you had me trippin'
All of the nights you had me stressin'
(You ain't going nowhere)
I'ma stick around, 'til I get a
'Til I get a return on my investment
All of the nights you had me trippin'
All of the nights you had me stressin'
You ain't going nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere in a hurry

[Verse 2]
Hope you're not thinking you ain't the one
Seems that you're tired of my face
'Cause you're always looking at some other chick
I don't play that shit
(Oh) hope you're not thinking you can just diss me
Homeboy, please
By the look on my grill
I know that you can tell I don't play that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
(No, no, no)
Everything ain't what it seems
(No, no, no, no, no)
You ain't going to be ignoring me
I work this relationship nine to five
And I deserve overtime
So you can say what you want
Get mad if you want
You ain't leaving me, you ain't leaving me
You can say what you want
Stay gone long as you want
You ain't leaving me, you ain't leaving me (oh)

[Chorus]
I'ma stick around, stick around
'Til I get a return on my investment
All of the nights you had me trippin'
All of the nights you had me stressin'
(You ain't going nowhere)
I'ma stick around, 'til I get a
'Til I get a return on my investment
All of the nights you had me trippin'
All of the nights you had me stressin'
You ain't going nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere in a hurry

[Bridge]
Can't let you get away from me (Let you get away)
Been with you so long, don't wanna be free (No)
I put in too much time
You ain't going nowhere, boy, you are mine
Been through so much with you (With you)
I gave you my whole life (Whole life)
So I'm gonna take my time
Wait patiently for what is mine

[Chorus]
You ain't going nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere fast, nowhere
Nowhere in a hurry
The first noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked, they looked up and they saw a star
Shining bright in the east, beyond them far
And to, to the earth, it gave great light, whoo whoo
So it, so it, so it, so it continued both day and night, woo
Noel (Noel), noel (noel), noel, noel
Born is the King of Israel
The first noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields, where they lay
Oh in fields (in fields) where they (where they) lay, keeping their sheep (keeping their sheep)
On (Oooooon)a cold winter's night that was, oh, it was so deep
Help me sing
Noel (Noel), noel (noel), noel, no no no noel
(Born is the King of Israel) He was born, born as the King of Israel
Born as the King, of Israel
The first noel
Jesus Christ is born today, yes he is
Peace on earth, good will toward men
Born is the King, born is the King
Of, of Israel
Noel (Noel), noel (noel), noel (noel), noel (noel)
Born is the King (Born is the King), oh
Born is The King (Born is the King), oh
Born is the King (Born is the King), of Israel
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Its 3 am, I can
Too late to call this is not like me
But I
The able of your chew when you were looking back
See, god you
I
But I
I haven
Tonight I stare out the window
Knowing I
Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life
Last night you saved my life
Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It
My children in your eyes, something you don
I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything
Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life with your love
Last night you saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life
Ohh yeah
I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Can
Last night you saved my life
And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you changed my life
It's in the silences, the words you never say
I see it in your eyes, it always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know, is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

Ooh, I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues, of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is how I feel, when I look into your eyes

I promise you, from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am, ooh yeah
Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night, I feel the tremble in your touch
Oh what I'm trying to say to you
I never said to anyone, "I promise"

I promise you, from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
(I do, my darling, I promise you)
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you)
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

You're everything I am, oh yeah
With everything I am

It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

My darling only you can make my dreams come true

And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life

I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

Ladies and gentlemen, the Crystal Room is proud to present the club debut of America's newest recording stars - The Dreams

[Verse 1: Deena Jones]
Every man has his own special dream
And your dreams' just about to come true
Life's not as bad as it may seem if you
Open your eyes to what's in front of you

[Hook: Deena Jones]
We're your dreamgirls
Boys we'll make ya happy... yeah!
We're your dreamgirls
Boys, we'll always care
We're your dreamgirls, dreamgirls will never leave you
No, no and all you've got to do is dream, baby...
We'll be there. Dreams!

[Verse 2: Deena Jones (Effie White, Lorrel Robinson)]
Dremgirls will help you through the night!
Dreams
Dreamgirls will make you feel all right
(Dreamgirls keep you dreaming your whole life through)
(Yes dreamgirls can make your dreams come true)
Dreams
Dreamgirls will help you to survive
Dreams
Dreamgirls keep your fantasies alive!
(Dreamgirls always love you and they'll be true!)
(Yes, dreamgirls can only belong to you)
I'm not the dream that you've had before
I'm the dream that'll give you more and more
I'm not feeling like I usually do
I think it might have something
To do with you
Every time you're near me
My body gets hot
Don't need a doctor
I know what I've got

Caught a touch of your love
It came on overnight
I must have held you too tight
Last night
Caught a touch of your love

Your affection has affected me

I'm feeling kind of dizzy
And weak in the knees
I've been in love before
But never so bad
You're in my system
And it's driving me mad
The fever from your kisses
Tears me apart
It starts from your lips
And goes straight to my heart
No use pretending
'Cause baby, I'm sure
There's no cure
And I've just gotta have more

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

[Verse 2]
Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotized, I'm getting high on love with you
I couldn't live without you now, Oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you
Hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes
Drowning in blue
Outta control
What can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you!
For the benefit of mr. kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The hendersons will all be there
Late of pablo fanques fair-what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way mr. k. will challenge the world!
The celebrated mr. k
Performs his feat on saturday at bishopsgate
The hendersons will dance and sing
As mr. kite flys through the ring don't be late
Messrs. k and h. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course henry the horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When mr. k. performs his tricks without a sound
And mr. h. will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight mr. kite is topping the bill

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

Biggie-
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
( you betta have your gat in hand cause man )
Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

2pac-
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Biggie-
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Cause thats the life when your
Living in the (ghetto) oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
Thats the life when ur
Living in the (ghetto)oh

(talking) It's a funny thing i kinda realized how powerful 2pac
And i was u kno what i'm saying cuz pac is a strong dude
Yo i kno him we two individual people we waged a coastal
Beef but even tho we were going thru our drama i would
Never wish death on nobody cuz there ain't no comin bac
All through the summer I have followed you around
Bringing a rose for the winter that's coming
Now the snow is on the ground
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need, and I
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow, and I
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
All I want for Christmas is you
All I want
All I want
All I want
All I want
Say all I want
All I want
Say all I want
All I want
All I want for Christmas is you
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Kissin' n huggin'
Gimme your love
All I want is you babe
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
I'm never satisfied with three meals a day
While the world is sleeping I'll be munching away
Gonna sneak into the kitchen, gonna tiptoe down and turn on the light
Right, yeah, if no one's around to see you
It don't matter if you snack all night

A million chicken bones are under my bed
A pile of Twinkie wrappers all 'round my head
Jelly doughnuts to the left of me
Got a bag of chocolate chips on the right
Right, yeah, if you don't mind the calories
It don't matter if you snack all night

[Chorus]
Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa
(repeat 4x)

[Verse 1 - Pitbull]
Woke up this mornin' with my pockets on E
Fuck being broke men this shit ain't for me
I'm lookin' for a lick, was sh-ttin' on them bricks
Makin' it rain in the club, outside jack boy shit
Make them strip in the dough

Drop that shit, hit that flow
Blow that shit, that's the show
'Cause if you do them things would go pa

[Chorus]
Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa
(repeat 4x)

[Verse 1]
I go down to the ocean
I take a walk upon your shores
I dig up a big old hairy clam
And then take out the pearl

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a metaphor

[Verse 2]
I marinate your flank steak
I'll bread your jumbo shrimp
Take your little brother to the zoo
And I'll marinate your flank steak

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a metaphor for fucking
It's a metaphor for fucking

[Verse 3]
I'll be the lounge band on your cruise ship
I'll fuck you with my dick
I'll put my magic wand inside your car
Then I'll marinate your flank steak

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a metaphor for flank steak
It's a metaphor for flank steak

[Verse 4]
Flank steak is delicious
Wish I was eating it right now
And every time that I see one
Wanna tittyfuck the flank steak

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a metaphor for fucking flank steak
Yeah, it's a metaphor for fucking flank steak

Some people say they search all their life
But boy, it's so nice I found you

[Chorus]
Some people want it all

Ooh, you you you

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people just don't know what they have

Some people say they search all their life
But boy, it's so nice I found you

[Chorus]

Baby, baby

Don't mean a thing

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's gone much too long
Any time she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know
She's gone to stay
It's breakin' me up
Anytime she goes away
Gotta leave the young thing alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's gone much too long
Any time she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
I wonder if she's gone to stay
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't a home
Any time she goes away

I know
She's gone to stay
It's breaking me up
Any time she goes away
Gotta leave the young thing alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
I wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Any time she goes away
Any time she goes away

[Intro: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woahh
Ohh, woah, woahh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but

[Chorus: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
Oh, my pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Outro: Adam Levine]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
Oh yeah, yeah...
And she will be loved...
Lately when I look into your eyes, I realize
You're the only one I need in my life
Baby I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

It seemed like the likely thing
From the start you told me
I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring
I want to give you everything

You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You and I are destiny
I know that you were made for me
Ohh, I can't control it
It's driving me, taking over me and I...
Ohh...

You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

Oo..Oo..No Oh..No

(With Chorus in the background)
You give me something I just can't deny
Something thats so real
I just can't control the way I feel. x2
Ohh I've never Felt like this
Rubbin' on that Italian leather
Konvict Jeans on
Ay yo Weezy, you ready?
Yeah!

I get it in 'til the sun rise
Goin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

I see police on that crooked, I
Doin' 100 on Interstate 95
My shorty leanin', blastin' that 'Do Or Die'
Wishin' that a motherfucker would, 'cause we certified

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
I'm a sniper sittin' on the roof, already saw y'all
Ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I'd rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than to let them haters come and make a name off me

That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

I'm the boss, it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all
Guess what? I won't be takin' that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm payin' them for

Ha ha, ain't that funny?
'Cause niggas they want war but ain't got money
'Cause I've seen 'em all talk until they start gunnin'
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing runnin'

Yeah, Akon! Weezy!
Block oil holdin' down Jersey
Devine makin' sure we gettin' it up front
My little brother Boo got that vision, baby
I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

Ah-oh, big money Weezy
White wife-beater with the sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah

I'm ballin', we ball out
Thoughts of we fallin' until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house

Damn! But I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks, call it cut throat
We bury powers on the set that they come from
We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke

We ball first when we ride
You in a Hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holdin' down Young Mula baby
That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 3]
I hang your picture well
I frame it, maybe need a nail
Or some tape, to stick it on the wall
When I walk in, it stay
Or maybe Velcro
To strap your bows and patches on the elbows
In the coat when it's cold
I mean winter-cold
That's rain, sleet, hail, snow
Hell, no
She's lookin' at me like I sell bras
But, I don't, wouldn't, won't
I am not that guy
Cross my T's, dot that I
Say it's hard to breathe?
We are not that high
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
Breathe it in, out again
Oxygen, count me out
Ten products in the aisle that I cannot
Breathe in, shoots in and think
If they sink, I won't swim
Like I won't hold my breath when I float in this bitch
Backstroke, high-dive, diving boards don't slip
And belly-flop, knock the block outta your socks
And your feet in the water, there to shock ya
Make it harder to breathe

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

[Post-Chorus]
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

You know while your mother is cooking the macaroni today
I figured I'd sit down and talk to you since your old enough
You know it's time that you really realize what this family is all about
'Cause about this time is when your gonna be able to join in
And earn some real money and real cash
But before you do that, I wanna teach you a little bit about loyalty
The main name of this game is respect and loyalty
Family is a big thing
When we do this kind of business, everything is with respect
And when a family member gets outta line and another family don't like it
One thing leads to another and the next thing you know, your gone
And then your just a memory of me, my hearts broke then
But you gotta remember, theres always family and loyalty
Loyalty is the main thing
Obviously you know I don't make my money
I don't make all my cash from goin' to work everyday
All these construction jobs we do and sanitation and private stuff
Is all from earned money through the family
And since your of age now I think it's time I taught you
What coming into the family and respect is all about
So the first thing you gotta learn is the name respect
That means you don't cross nobody, you don't go over the line
Once you go over that line, there's no coming back
Whether you're a member of the family or not
That's when people get whacked
And we don't want nobody whacked in our family
So I gotta teach you the proper way of respect
When you're earning money, everybody earns
Everybody eats bread, it's all about cash money
That's what it's all about, making the money
So the first thing of business is this
You remember your name, you don't forgets your roots
You never ever disrespect anyone that's above you
Especially your Capo, especially the big time guys
Those are the guys you listen to
You never ever disrespect anyone, unless your told to
Unless you get the okay
And if there is no sit down, there's nothin'
The loser microphone abuser
Feet hurtin i just walked from
Juersalem
So you should get onside with the movement
Im the proof
And ill die just to prove it
Whatcha ya wanna to know?
Anything, whatever
I can't tell ya, i can show ya better
Me and my gun
We took an oath together
We swear we never die if we both together
Girl this is my testifcation

Ima wayne on they head like precepitation
And inhale you you need justifaction
But but for me it is just a vacation
Yeah, you can check my reservation
And youll see the top is my destination
You should admire my dedication
Im a winner just call me congratulations!
Weezy

[Obie Trice:]
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game profane, no image
I came in the game with a name i was given
From a man who didn't give a fuck about his legitamate
I proclaim the name though
Never in vain no
Watch the change grow
A young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped a range rov'
Now they want my brains on the main row
But they dont understand what i came for
I came forward, wit a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Get money like Ross Perrault
Im often told, a coffins the routes i go
Oh thats the road you on, oh no
Im down for the rifle tone of faux faux
They'll never try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that your loco, put hoes in my photo, NOPE!
Ope, hold toast no jokes since thugs beat the poli'

[Akon:]
Stayin in im just gettin much older
Its time to go start puffin up trees
Hot Glocks just get much colder, dodgin and duckin the police
How much longer must I stand on this corner?
I Gotta get off right away
How much longer must me see sell on this corner before
They take my life away?
Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G

Whatchu gonna do with it A?
Whatchu gonna do?

[Akon]
Take 'em on back to the street

[Chrous: Akon]
I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, RED tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you, Yeah
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Thats risky, the bitch tenderize out a nigga
His history's snitch, who decided he's a member?
Once he got pinched, coincided with law
Same homie say he lay it down for the bar
Brought gang squad around ours
How could it be?
Been homies since superman draws
Only phoniness never came to par
He had us, a true neighborhood actor
Had his back with kay's, now we see through him like X-Rays
Cuffed in that Adam car, no matter his loss
We at 'em, it's war
Knowin not to cross those reservoir dogs
You help to plant seeds, just to be a vegetable?
When we invest in team, its to the death for sho'
No X and O's, guess its how its go's
When friends turn to fows

[Chorus: Akon]
I keep the thin on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
Ya see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you Yeah
Just dont, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We started out as a crew, when one speak, it's all honest
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's
Recondences when we peep enemies on us
Been in these corners
Sellin' like anything on us
Knowing heaven'll shun us being devil's miners
But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China
We gon' keep the grind up till death can find us
Mean time, leanin in them European whips reclined up
It's eye for an eye for the riders
We ain't trying to get locked up, we Soul Survivors
Po Po's is cowards, its no you, its ours
We vow this, mixing Yayo with soda powder
Who woulda known he would fold and cower
Once the captain showed, he sold Old McDonalds
No X and O's, tex calicos
Aimed at your chest nigga

[Chorus: Akon]
I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you
Just dont, whatever you do, snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't lace you, Yeah

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Nowadays, Sammy the Bull's, got the game full
So he moved to a rural area to keep cool
They snitchin on the snitch now, it's nothing to tell
Nowadays your circle should be small as hell
Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me
Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually
No penitentiary, though we know clemecy
You will meet the lord snitchin, given us a century
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon
Thats how they react now, weak, when the heat's on them
Stop snitchen, you asked for the life you live in
This act is not permitted, no where on the map
It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison
If you've been in it along with 'em
And then snitch and become hidden
No X and O's, tex calicos

[Intro: P. Diddy]
This is the remix
D-Dot, Hitmen, baby
B.I.G., Bad Boy
(Notorious)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G., P. Diddy]
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin' me
Sayin' the best part of the day is my half
Feedin' me breakfast, and givin' me a sponge bath
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm gettin' high, gettin' head on the beach (That's right)
Chillin', sittin' on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin'
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (Fuck 'em)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

[Chorus: P. DIddy]
(Notorious) What's his name? What's his name? Come on
(Notorious)
He is, he is
(Notorious)
We are, we are, come on
(Notorious)
He is, he is, Bad Boy, come on
(Notorious)

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
This for my niggas slingin' thangs, had my ring encaged
Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the V-trim that win
And the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggas to kill than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, "Trick, what up?"
Call me Sean if you suck, call me gone when I nut (Come on)
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck, uh
Twist and bend her up, you know the deal
Niggas talkin' real greasy on some ballin' shit (That's right)
Funny how quick these pricks forget (Come on)
Actin' like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
Switched that 5, copped that 6 (That's right)
It's all good, you know who the clone is
Fuck the Joneses, niggas tryin' to keep up with the Combses

[Chorus: P. Diddy]
(Notorious)
Come on, y'all, what's his name? What's his name?
(Notorious)
We are, we are

He is, he is, come on

We are, we are, Bad Boy
(Notorious)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim, P. Diddy]
Who that queen bitch, keep her glass filled to the rim?
The Notorious K-I to the M (That's right)
That's me, on MTV, no doubt
Titty out like what — I don't give a fuck
Y'all know my attitude, can't stand my cologne
Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperone (That's right)
Things done changed, but we continue to reign
As the King and the Queen of hip-hop, me and B.I
Frank White still listen to all the attention
I'm by his side, with the chrome fifth, playin' my position (That's right)
Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rockin' mics in high heel stilettos (That's right)
We takin over like Francis
Switchin' our styles like the hottest new dances (Come on)
See, I let y'all live to stack a little paper
Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor!
(Did y'all hoes a favor)

[Outro: P. Diddy]
(Notorious)
He is, he is

What's his name? What's his name?

Put your hands in the air like this

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I'm a ninja yo, my life is like a video game, I maintain
When I'm in the zone one player, one life on the mic, limited time!
Go ninja, go! No fuckin' around I'm cutting down anyone in my path
Trying to fuck up my game with razor sharp lyrical throwin' stars, jirre my flow's hot
Hostile, wild out of control ninja skop befokte
Rof taal, but I found some tough times, met fokkol
Kos, skraal, till I hit triple 7 at the ATM
Straight famine or feast when you living on the razor edge, stay sharp sharp
Rolling with the SOS high-energy you've never seen
Zef so fresh, uh! When we mic check
Hi-tek flows flex, yo we optimistik
Not fuckin depressed, we not like the rest
My style is UFO, totally unknown, you can't fuck with
My new zef flow, I'm hard to miss, 'you can't do this, you can't do that'
Yo fuckin who said so? I do what I like, too hot to handle, too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one, I-I-I-I-I want to knife you
I'm a ninja
Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Ninja is poes cool, but don't fuck with my game boy
Or I'll poes you, life is tough, when I get stuck and my time is up
I push through, till I break-break-break on through to the
Other side, fantastically poor with patience like the stalker
Ninja is hardcore, been cut so deep feel no pain
It's not sore, don't ask for kak or you'll get
What you ask for, I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn, trying to get through the night, just a man with a will to survive
My blades swing free, decapitate a hater
With amazing ease, this is not a game boy
Don't play with me, I work my mic-saber
Like a wild fuckin savage from the dark side: danger!
Yin to the yang, totally hi-tek, ninja's motherfuckin
Big in japan, I've seen the future, but I've never got
Nothing in my hand, except a microphone, big dreams
And a plan, fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja
Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai aai aai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I met her like a month ago south beach bungalow
We rollin in dat white thang
I'm rolling up one of those
She lookin like my wife thang
Boy I need one of those
Girl it's not a slice thang ask about me
My heart in the trap my money on my mind
But when I got you in my lap
We far from killing time
And they say that opposites attract
But we both on our grind
I love to touch you from the back
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way things are going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around (should've known better)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around

Mami you know you the only one I can't control what they talk about
You listen to the he say she say might as well pack my shit start walkin out
You know they blood boil when ever they see us together

Let me paint this picture for you, baby
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
You cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case, scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl I ain't somebody I'm out of sympathy
See
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
See?
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
You should've listened to me, baby
Because
(What goes around comes back around)

It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me
Why?
Damn

[Chorus]
I love his big ego
He talk like this 'cause he could back it up...

Lets Chill....Like Zero Below
Had to introduce her to my hero below
Not a waste of time says my Frank Muller
And we could swim around
And just drown in the cooler
Baby we could chill like
Ice im the jeweler
Wrap around your ass like a bracelet or a hula...
Hoop!
The group...is Young Mula
But theres another subject

See right now im tryna budge into your situation, girl im like a mental patient
Lookin for an invitation
To your destination
Girl i like your presentation
And i like your dedication
I ain't talkin admiration
Girl im talking mezmoration!!
If, if...
If I were a
If, if...
If I were a
If, if...
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a, were a...

[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a boy
If I were a...
If I were a boy
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Wish you were a better man
Boy...
If I were a boy

But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me

[Intro: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Yes! (Whoo, ow!)
So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young
You ready?

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Geah!
History in the making, part two!
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Geah!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Geah!)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Whoo!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (No)
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (No, no, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?"
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur - chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
How you think I got the name Hova? (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
Ever since I made the change over to platinum (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
The game's been a wrap, one

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
You got me so crazy, baby (Hey!)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Looking crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Baby, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah, babe)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Oh)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Whoa)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
You're so sleepy
Wish that he could stay
Love him so
But now it's getting late
He'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
One more summer
And your dream comes true
Yo Ferris, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
I spit it through the wire, man
If this ain't dedication I don't know what is, man
Listen, first of all I want to thank you for your support
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

Uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter
Sunsets feel righter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this
I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you notice but them accident pictures were bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cuz that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
Man, I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I go on Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throw in some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident they tellin' me it's the cheeks
And if you look at history
That last rapper that almost died sold 6.5
'Cept I'm comin' from the Chi
Through the wire to the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them could of been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Heck naw, that boy is raw
You hear that? That's all that jewelry I got on man
Sometimes I take it off at the airport but I still get stopped
They be like "There go Kayne, there go Kayne!
Can I see some I.D. please? So thank you very much"
First of all, my momma named me Kanye so y'all gon' call me Kanye
I'm like the girl on the 'Sixth Sense'
"I'm feelin' much better now"
I feel a whole hell of a lot better man
Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw baby the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes that i know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist i kiss your lips
You're my sexy mexican maid

Let me please get on my knees
I come alone

When i wake up in the morning
She greets me where i lay
I look outside to find it's a bright and sunny day
So serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can i say she's my sexy mexican maid

Let me please get on my knees

She puts me in a bubble bath
She tickles me and i laugh
She washes me until i'm clean
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it very fast
Let me please get on my knees
Oh let me please

[Verse 1]
You take from me
So why you holding back? Boy, why you holding back?
So vacantly
But you won't get away with that, no, you won't get away with that

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Verse 2]
Don't wait for me
When you know you did me wrong, I've been holding on too long
Eventually
I’ll make the call

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Bridge]
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

Managements player alive
Bitches dancin, shakin ass

I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows and the water rolls high
I can hear a voice calling out there in the darkness
But I sit here alone too lonesome to cry

Oh, the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no one to love or kiss me goodnight

We met there one night on the banks of the river
Sat there holding hands and making our vow
That we never would part and be happy together
But a new love she's found, she's gone from me now

Oh, the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no one to love or kiss me goodnight

[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love

[Verse 2]
You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

[Bridge]
I wake up
Alone with it all
I wake up
But only to fall

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love
Just looking out for love

[Interlude: Stevie Nicks & Lindsey Buckingham]
Well, it's a big, big love, yeah

[Common]
After bein' 25 you know just trying to survive in the world
Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway just when you start getting that little age and experience to you
You start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinking check it

Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say "in Jesus name" or Hum do Allah
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'cause when the trumpets blowing, 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 goin' get home
Only 144,000 goin' get home
Only 144,000 goin' get it baby

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just want to be happy with being me

[Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title
That their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconsciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know
Who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, somethin' in me want to know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustling was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only
Science and math are universal
Taking elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to over stand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with followin' I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You goin' surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and
Can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
Well, I've lived and I've learned
I've taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I have cried
I failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
I found joy through my pain
Just want to be happy, being me
Being me
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singing
You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
A wanna be gangster
Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With blackslide Dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race
Just loose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go (oh woh woh)
Don't ask me why
I'm flying so high
Mr Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searching for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on Vaudeville
I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go (oh woh woh)

Where do we go nobody knows
I've gotta say I'm on my way, down

God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line
I've gotta say I wasted all your time, honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face
Yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I want it to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way, down
When God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
Oh yeah
Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I want it to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

I really can't stay - But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight
To break the spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside
I simply must go - But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical storm
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Oh, your lips are delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home - But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?
ByThere's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ohhh, baby it's cold outside

[Snoop Dogg (Master P)]
Hey yo (Ghetto Postage)
Give me something that makes a nigga want to pop his motherfuckin' collar
(With a lil' West Coast twist on it)
(Master P and Snoop, ha ha, tah dow, poppin' collars)

[Chorus: Master P & Snoop]
Pop those collars
Pop those collars
Pop those collars
That's the just the way we do it
Pop those collars
We changed the game

[Snoop]
Slid up in the door, get up in ya ho
Sippin' on some Mo with Big D from the mad ass 6-0
Stretched out on the couch with some Mary Jane
Doghouse nigga, we all in the same game
An every nigga in my click got the platinum chain
Blang, blang Doggy's Angel's same thing
Eastsidaz same thing, rip riders ask my nephew Kokane

[Master P & Snoop]
Cause game recognize game and we got it
No Limit and Dogg Pound, we rowdy, get em' up
We bang bang

[Snoop]
On this music that we make ho
In the cars, the clubs, or when we smoke dope
We drop that shit for you kin folk
And poor folks no joke, loc loc
Blaze a sack loc, bust a back stroke
And pop ya motherfuckin' collar till ya break ya back loc

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Ah dog we off the heezy
Snoop and P together for cheesy
Poppin' collars from the South to the Wizest
We off, see the tank around our nizeck
We O.G. show me love
And the Baker Boys started the buzz
Now we California livin' like Dre and Pac
And them No Limit boys, see we can't be stopped
Me and E-Feezy go way on the bizack
Remember Baby D, TRU it and Prizack
My essay homie, chop chop got the dizope
While me and Xzibit was ballin' by cizoast
I'm the black Slim Shady so don't try to play me
Turn a six into a Bentley and drive em' crazy
Roll up to Eastside back to the West
Represent Richmond, California to the South, respect

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
I'll bless you before I diss you
Why y'all miss me, shit I miss you
So sweet, so sure but so low
So just let it all go, serious we sick of this
Dog homie, ask ya kids they put you up on it
On the corners they poppin' they collars
While back in the days, shit niggas used to stack they dollars
Make a nigga want to holler
Players, pimp, p-poppers, impersonators
Real rip riders, Eastsidaz and regulators
Haters come in all shapes, sizes and colors
But we on top of things so they can't get above us
Hate us or love us, we rollin' with the heat huggers
Thuggers, house party niggas fuck clubbers
With inane in my pockets, poppin' my collar pushin' and shovin'

[Chorus]
Murder

[Verse 1:]
I be the one with the women by the dozen
I get em all; sister, friend, or cousin
I never thought I'd be the one to fall in love
Then she came along (She came along)
She had it all, beauty of an actress
Plus she was smart, help me do my taxes
She'd give my lovin' incredibly with the passion
I can't explain, I can't refrain
Tears is fallin', never thought I'd see the day
Friends is callin' askin, "Homie, are you okay? "
She told me her love was mine
And then she gave what's mines away

[Chorus:]
And it was like click clack bang bang

[Verse 1]
Dancing in the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence
Crystals on the skyline
Cut to midnight
Ultraviolet

[Chorus]
You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

[Verse 2]
Flying through the black night
You’re the angel
In the moonlight
Running through the thunder
Undercover
Silver lover

[Chorus]
You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

[Bridge]
You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

[Chorus]
You’re the one that can make me stay
You’re the only one who makes me feel this way
You’re the one that’s been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You’re the one that can turn the page
You’re the one that came along and unlocked the cage
Now I’m dancing in the dark

[Outro]
Yeah, I’m dancing in the darkness
Three years before I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I’m drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It’s a criminal feeling
Happiness cries when the tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I’m staying right here, no I’ll never be leaving
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'bout clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on, whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot 'cause we ballin'

Girl you the drink with all that goody power

Get dirty all night, that's part of my (plan)
We buildin' castles that's made out of (sand)

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

Like "Damn it, I know ya."
You wanna shoot like a gun outta holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

Haters in my face
Try to keep me down
But you know we keep on shining (

[Andy:] Here we go!)
Two crazy big stars from opposite worlds

'Bout to set this track on fire (

[Andy:] Yeah, she's the queen of country!)
He's a comedy prince

Makin' something out of nothing (

[Andy:] We hooked up in the studio to make this song!)
But as usual, we ended up f**king (

[Andy:] No doubt!)

[ANDY]
Flashback to when I first met Reba
Sitcom dressing room, puffing on cheeba
I said I was a fan, she said "groovy"
Dropped her denim skirt and said, "hop to it"
Made love all night (

[Kenan:] More like we f**ked!)
Kids banging on the door, trynna interrupt
But them autographs can wait
Cause this is way too strong
I can't leave it alone
Because her p**sy's the bomb

[KENAN]
Well my p**sy is the bomb and that's a fact
But these n-words keep on tripping (

[Andy:] Okay!)
So I stay on my grind and drop these hits
Cause I can't go back to stripping (I'm Reba!)

(

[Andy:] You're my undercover freak)
And you're my best friend, but our families don't approve
(

[Andy:] That's right cause I'm a city boy)
And I'm a country girl
And I'll never leave your sweet balls blue

[ANDY]
Ay, because a girl like Reba's got just what I need
With big, broad shoulders and a red a** weave (

[Kenan:] And a penis)
Hot damn, she fly
All she wanna do is f**k me
I'm a lucky guy (

[Kenan:] I'm a guy too)

My friends think I should dump her
They say she's a man who found a wig in a dumpster (

[Kenan:] Your friends are smart)
Naw, Rebs, they're just jealous cause I'm dating a star instead of hanging with the fellas (

[Kenan:] Hanging like my nuts)
Word up, they're just liars
They can't believe that I could pull Reba McEntyre

[KENAN]
Since I came out my mama's b*&^
I knew I was destined for greatness
I looked in a dumpster and saw a wig
And thought, "hey brother, I'm gon' take this" (

[Andy:] Tell 'em, Reba!)
So I put it right on and took a stroll
Right over to 30 Rock (

[Andy:] SNL!)
I saw Andy Samberg and he thought I was Reba
And I made him suck my dirty cock

[ANDY]
So there you have it
Two worlds collide
We the new Bonnie and Clyde (

[Kenan:] Reba!)
From haystacks to Maybachs, our love will survive
For Reba, I ride, 'til the day that we die (

[Kenan:] I'm Reba!)
Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
But mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway
The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
You were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes
Saying, "if my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now"
'cause everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
Why
I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How
I don't know how
I don't know how but I just sit back and I see my way right through it
When the memories are ten feet tall
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Days are long and words are cruel
They won't get the best of you
'cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me

Love you sittin on my rim, matter fact 'gon hop in
Now jump in the backseat and chill
Got some for you girl you can feel
Lay your body down in the six forty five
Let the soft leather caress ya while I drill
I know you like it, I know you like it
Just ran into Divine with a shorty so fine lookin so excited
Now she thinks we all cassonovas, that's when I put the legs on my shoulder
And just ride her like a Range Rover
Like a dollar bill I had to unfold her, ummm hmmm
R. Kells cop three in the shack, Sean Paul hit the back and never came back

Daylight come and now we want a little more of that

Baby, I'm sorry
Can't you find a way to
Somehow forgive me?
I never meant to hurt you
Somebody take my head off
'Cause I never meant to hurt you, babe
I know I don't deserve another chance
But I had to say it anyway
I can't sleep, I can't think
I can't eat, I'm so weak
And I won't breathe again
Breathe again, breathe again
It was such a silly move I made
I'm the only one who truly loves me
Took advantage of the love you gave
I turn around the truth, now look at me
I can't sleep, I can't think
I can't eat, I'm so weak
And I can't breathe again
Breathe again, breathe again
Na na na
Na na na
Now I'm the guy you read about
In those freaky magazines
Sometimes I can't believe my ears
And what they say about me
Who gives a fuck 'bout what they think
Is what my old G used to say
You just keep on doing your own thing, boy
And sing your praises up that way
And you'll sleep, and you'll think
And you'll eat, won't be weak
And you will breathe again
Breathe again, breath again
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
Na na na
You'll breathe again, breathe again
Breathe again, breathe again
You'll breathe again, breathe again
Breathe again, breathe again
You'll breathe again, breathe again
Breathe again, breathe again
You'll breathe, you'll sleep
You'll think
Na na na
Doctor, doctor, need you bad, call me, babe
Doctor, doctor, where you at? Give me something
I need your love, I need your love, I need your loving
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me coming

My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you'll know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Boy, I'm aching, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive
My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you'll know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

You've got my life in the palm of your hands
Come and save me now, I know you can

Don't let me die young
I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my doctor
We can get it cracking chiropractor
I know you can save me and make me feel alive

Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
And now I'm lying lavish and all I do is think and say

[Verse 1]
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first, oh-oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first, oh-oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

[Verse 2]
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like a ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do

[Breakdown]
Let's go
Let me see what you can do
(Circus, circus)
I'm running this (Like a circus)
(Circus, circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like a circus)

[Chorus]
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

Love

[Verse 1]
I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

[Verse 2]
You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

[Bridge]
They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love

[Breakdown]
I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves

I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Yeah
Oh yeah I know what we gonna do
Hey
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
I hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat man I be in the street it's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no Inception in this bitch
I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call, to the bartender, what you got left?
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate, 'cause we everywhere and you not there
Ha
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up

(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds

Blue jeans, I'm faded, mindin' my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Lee you bitch you, you hot as an igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Ju Jitsu
Hello World, I'm with a yellow girl, number 2 pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half pipe

Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B yes definitely
Up in the studio, I got on my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection
I'm Decatur til I die, yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the f-cks a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I, say its a curse but it's emotionally a blessing
To a nigga from the hood tryna aim for the top
But I don't even need no directions
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
These niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first
Nigga keep your nourishment first and your mind on my lyrics
'Cause what you hoping to accomplish I already did it bitch
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we)

All night, all you see is strange clouds (all you see, all you see)
Strange clouds, strange clouds
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum
(Bum, bum, bum)

He lies, he bluffs he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun
(Gun, gun, gun)

I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

He is a villain of the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun
(Fun, fun, fun)
That mans a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none
(None, none, none)

All I know, should let go but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

And he's got my name tattooed on his arm
His lucky charm, so I guess its okay
He's with me

And I hear people talk
(People talk)
Trying to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear I don't care

But Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
But Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

But Mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
One, two, one, two, three

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)

Never had much faith in love or miracles (Oooh!)
Never wanna put my heart on the line (Oooh!)
But swimming in your world is something spiritual (Oooh!)
I'm born again every time you spend the night (Oooh!)

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows

'Cause you make feel like

And right there is where I wanna stay (Oooh!)

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise

If u call on reach, im on the streets
And im hungry like a dog on unleash
But im a tiger, and a dog is a feast
And I see through the fog in the trees
Because the nigga makes a logs and leaves
I walk through the jungle with a lion on my sleeve
I need a money donor, cuz im dying to resist
I know mama gat her eyes on her seed
Therefore, I never stop, I just proceed
Their eyes make the peace hard to read
But it says, ?why im not leave

(SIZZLA)
And they actin oh body

The only reason why them bogus living
Ain't no way down, please stay down
Let them stay down, put them in a woodbox be laid down..

Pistol in da trunk, and the baby in da car seat
Drive fast lane, with them eyeball glassy
And about the hour, him a heading to the money
Take your coughin baby, give the baby back to mommy
Peer gunshot, shoot him below to him tommy
Bat the man down, boy, im shit around party
Party up, party up, they put the panty up

He make bad girl them for want me, want me in tha storm ay
My girl she need me, my girl she want me
Because me reppin youngmoney, me youngmoney..

[Q-Tip - Intro]

I don't care who first or who last
I just know y'all betta rock dis at da drop of a dime, baby!
(Renaissance...)
I don't care what chy'all say or what chy'all do
But you got to be finished befo' the music is through...

[Q-Tip - Verse 1ne]
I don't think they heard me, hold up..
..So here we go, now
It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to cool out where all the other kids played
'Cause I was way too ill, I would home my skill
Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, brothers would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where rappers would gather to see my blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big Pete, Tanya, and Sir ?
When in the heat of the cipher, I was not liable
For all the casualties of the dutty MCs'
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
C'mon Bust..

[Busta Rhymes - Verse 2wo]
Yo, yo, God body, wise intellegence
Smack niggas and wrestle with elephants
My beloved respect my benevolence
Comin like missles, the issue is this
Be the shit you can't rebel against
Then I sniff out you niggas that be hidin in bushes - whassup?
And strangle niggas like poisonous octopuses - shut the fuck up!
Back with hazardous weathers and blizzards
As I spit, stickin out my tongue like an iguanlizard
At you corny niggas, Animal Planet rap, Wildlife
Stabbin you in yo' back wild knife (Ahhhh!)
While I hunt and eat you niggas like food, leavin you bleedin
BEATS - rattle the speakers, like some buffalo stampedin
If you don't understand what I'm sayin
Lyrically I'm like goons acci-DENTALLY beatin you like gorillas playin (Ha ha!)
Bitches know when I spit, I be seducin 'em
Countless money with diamonds that's buried in Jerusalem
The Renaissance {*echoes*}

[Q-Tip: interlude]
{*imitating Marley Marl}
WHOOO, that Busta Rhymes right there
I don'- look like sendin Raekwon in here
Where Raekwon at??

[Raekwon - Verse 3hree]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, squeezin Johnny Walker neck up in the Benzo freezin
The head-long cock block pumpin is easy
Poison medals on my neck wrists and arms
Louie luggages is bronze, a big bag of D, Happy Kwanz'
Together we the Chi-Lites to twists of the O'Jays
One line from this'll have you leanin like roach spray
Poison up on holstery, my boys in, this is our choice
Brooklyn, Shaolin whylin in the Royces
Old Gold at the Golden Globes, my robe hitin the cement
Chef in the buildin, yep and he been
A thousand one goons at the Rumba
Certified clients, drug money and sum'thin up giants
Yo, it's the Tarzan cocaine clan in the area
Gorillas in Louie hats, the more, the merrier
Take mines, take a hunnid nines
We be runnin out of rhymes, never bullets
Try to front and you mines
Renaissance...

(WHOOOOOOOOOO-WHEEE!!!)

[Lil Wayne - Verse 4our]
*clears throat* A-go off...
Let me spaz, let me spaz (c'mon)
Though they call me Weezy F., you gon let me pass
So ahead of my time with my next week ass
Money on the dinner table like let's eat cash
And I do it for the killers and the hundred dolla billas
And from now on, I don't think you should stunt without a million -
Dollars in the bank, I got money in the bank
Now throw yo' hands in the air if yo' pussy don't stank
You got a bullet and a shank, I got a bullet and a tank
I got fur, in my boots, and the hoody on the minks
Stop sweatin me, you should follow me, I'm directing it
Other fools break it down, I be dissecting it
EVER since I made it up out of middle America
Err'body wanna be in my genital area
Butcha better stay away from my chemical barrier
Weezy, baby, straight out the cesarean, NUGGUH!!
(What's it called man?) Oh yeah...(Hah?)
"Renaissance Rap"

[Marley-Tip - Outro]
MAN, I ain't gon give y'all my microphone no more!
'Cause y'all tear it up when you get it
Lemme see who you have
Now, you have Q-Tip, you have Busta Rhymes
You have Raekwon the Chef, you had Lil Wayne on here
Man, I ain't givin y'all my microphone no mo'

Once upon a time I almost lost my mind
I was lonely, so lonely
Once upon a time

Hoping every day things would go my way
Then you came into my life
Now everything is fine

I never knew what love could do till I met you
Now everything is oh so cozy
Now my skies are blue all because of you
I'm so glad; I was lonely
Once upon a time
Three passports, three first class
Tickets to the money, straight flights

I live by the code, wardrobe from 'round the globe
All I need is a kilo, an apron, show me the stove
General Electric, perfected, cooking them O's
No more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves

Hoes, I need a condom for my toast
Busting in these niggas standing flat footed, I'm on my toes
Froze, pandemonium overdose
Paparazzi in the trees, please, curtains closed

Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf
Heroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff
Playing for keeps, I busting 'em 'fore she get off
I run the city, just pull up and drop the kid off, ha

Welcome to organized crime
Money got me excited, I'm coming four or five times
The '45 for you niggas with 9 lives
Penthouse on college money, long as Ocean drive
Black Chevy Tahoe's, stations up the potholes
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off in the synagogue
Issue you your warrant, informant, bitch I've been a boss

Counting money stacks, yours' counterfeited
I made my money back when your accountant didn't
Went against the odds, it's only one Rozay
My nigga okay

I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop

Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number 1 niggas, your bitch notice it

Million ways to make this money, you gon' get it
On the grind 24/7 I'm with it
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid
Jumping out the Phantom like a motherfucking midget

Money knocking at the front door, I'm like, who is it?
It's Benjy, tell my lil nigga, go and get it
Cause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm gon' spend it
I'm like one's for the money, two's for the show of it
Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it
Four for my niggas that be stacking and then blowing it
You would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in

Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium
Papi got them keys in, he like my custodian
I was trying to bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon
I was in them trenches, getting down and dirty serving it

We's part of the reason that them churches got some services
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering
Nigga called my phone, talking reckless, I ain't heard of it
Fuck ya girl, give her back, I'm courteous

I can keep a secret with Vicky, have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and telling Meagan good morning
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton
With Paris from Hollywood to the hood

I want a mom and I swear that I want 'em all, wanna fuck 'em all
Had my niggas down so I'm screaming fuck the law
Monday night wrestling, I'm so fucking Raw
She gon' wipe me down, I'm gon' brush her off

I'm way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak
Word to the homies Ross, I can get that 9 Piece
For the low that 9 cheap, call me if you want it
Haters see me and I'm staying got 'em sick to they stomach
I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop

Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number one niggas, your bitch notice it

Whole time, see that fly shit I've been on
All the girlfriends fall in line from my spin off
That's game bitch ain't shit, nudies and some J six
Where I'm from, it's cold and niggas get at you like handkerchiefs

God bless you unless you was disrespectful
Bitches disappoint you but money won't ever stress you
They say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down
So all that shit you niggas kicking with worried about

Catch me at the carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half
Flyest niggas out here, period no maxi-pad, bitch I got a right to brag
Bitch, I got a right to boast
Presidential suite and bitch and I never use my right to vote

My vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous
And I am dead serious, bitch, I spit with embalming
Shout out to lil G, shout out Tre and Mohammad
That BOA shit we get paid with death over dishonor

I'm known as Obama's don't, I know no one in Congress
These bitches love me all the way, you got sort of's and kind of's
Sort of remind you, why you don't call no vagina
Just give 'em awesome intercourse and ignore there inquires

Quietly becoming a top ten, you dreamed of getting cream
Best believe I'm John Deere, Smith, greenist Moncler shit
Earth tones in the winter, Purp rolled in a rillo
I am on my John Lithgow

Out of this 3rd Rock, nigga it out
I am on my Tom Brady, y'all niggas is Eric Crouch
What the blood clot, Tommy Frazier, fuck yourself
I can see your album coming, that shit's like a sucker punch

Here for breakfast, fuck for lunch
Dinner time she bring a friend, write my shit so vicious
Y'all are like snitches you can't see the pen
Always on some new shit CNN, shitting on these niggas like I need a pen

I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop

Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number 1 niggas, your bitch notice it
See it started 'round December when we first talked
But then I knew you was fake from the start
Sayin' that you love me, playin' with my heart
Actin' like you cared, just to be around a star
(But oh no)
Me shoulda knew when you take me to the mall
Smilin' at my face but you're buying up a storm
Now I regret it, should I listen to my mom?
To my mom, whoa
Everything good must come to a stop
You played with my head
Now you're 'bout to get dropped
Gimme my ring, gimme my watch and go
So girl, it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl it's over
Talkin' on the phone like everyday
Sendin' me messages, "Hey baby"
Tellin' me you want me to meet your family
When you really, you just tryin' to go to the Grammys
(Well, oh no)
I shoulda knew you wasn't for me
You didn't like me, you liked by Bentley
All them stories were shady
But baby, don't worry 'cause
Everything good must come to a stop
You played with my head
Now you're 'bout to get dropped
Gimme my ring, gimme my watch and go
So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over, and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over, and I don't wanna see your face again, again
Ever since she walked through that door
She left my heart on the floor
And I can't take this no more
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna see her again
Ever since she walked through that door
She left my heart on the floor
And I can't take this no more
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna see her again
So girl, just pack your bags and leave my crib
Girl, stop talkin', I'm tired of this
All this fussing, all this fighting tonight
So girl, it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl, it's over, hey, so girl, it's over
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you
And you're were long meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say, "We'll never part"
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight
Je t'aime toi
Pour raisons sentimentales
J'espere que tu me crois
Je t'ai donne mon coeur
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know I ain't for no teasin'
Treat me sweet and gentle
When you say goodnight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me
I get sentimental
When you hold me tight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please say you love me too
When I get this feelin'
I'm in ecstasy to squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Want you to know I just need squeezing now
Control
Control, show me
You're not, control, show me
Don't know where I...
Control, show it
You're not what you wanna take
Control it, show me
Control

Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight

Control, show me
Take control, show me
Show me control
You're not what you wanna look

You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
Show me, show me, show me, show me
You're not what you wanna take, control
Show me, show me, show me
You're not what you wanna, show me

Are we fighting by the thought of losing out your beat alone
Won't be the one who has to sleep without you
By the time I'm done I'll get my way I know that you gonna want to take me home
Let it happen and you'll be the one who

Will take the time to compromise
No backin' down "see you soon"
Nothing else will ever come between us
Leave you with nothing else to say no use and tell me what to do
Always be the one that you know you trust

Let me catch my breath
Hold me to your chest
Feel our hearts collide
From the other side
Keep it close to you
Until the night is through
You're still in control
From the other side

You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
You and me will take control
And with this time make it all on, control
Show me
You're not, control, show me
Control, show me
You're not what you wanna take
Show me, you
Show me, you
Shake it up...shake it up girl
Shake it up...bass
Hey! Shake it up...shake it up
She makes me think of lightning in skies
(Her name) She's sexy!!
How else is God supposed to write
(Her name) She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her
She wants to move (she wants to move)
She wants to move (she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her (damn!)
Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!
(Look at her) I can see it in her eyes
She (come here babe) hopes this lasts forever, Hey!!
Her off beat dance makes me fantasize
(Her curves) She's sexy!!
Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride
(Her ass) She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, and guarding her
She wants to move (she wants to move)
She wants to move (she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her (beat it!!)
Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!

(Yo why you, why you, why you wit that fool?)
Hot y'all! Hey! Huuuhh!
(I like it when you're wet baby) Ehh
(Here comes another papercut) (x2)

She says she loves me
But she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts
It's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
Claims she loves me
But she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up
Here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
Til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades.....

We met 22 years back
Fresh out the womb
Now she consumes me
No room for self these days
And she's so demanding
Do this, do that
Don't forget to take your medicine (medicine)
I hate it when her face is invading my head again
The welcome mat reads "please take off your shoes"
But she disregards the statement
I've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs to
Satisfy her needs
But I'm fed up
With plugging cuts everytime they bleed
So I dip my pen in the puddle
What a bloody mess its been
Trying to end this struggle
But I love her
She's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her
I start bleeding when she's leaving
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned
On my missions to try to find her but
I'll sit alone until she comes back home
And I'll be waiting by the phone
(phone rings:) "Hello?"
(On phone:) "Hello, uh- I've had my eye for quite a while."
"Who is this?"
(On phone:) "Listen-"

Here comes another papercut (x2)
She says she loves me
But she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts
It's like another papercut
And now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
Til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
Claims she loves me
But she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up
Here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
Til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades.....

(On the Phone)
She don't live here no more
I heard she's staying down the street with the dead beat
That don't treat her right with two bad ass kids
Guilt and Regret
And I'm willing to bet
My last dollar that she's wishing she was kissing me
Man the nerve of this bitch
Pardon my French
But it's been 10 days
And I'm getting kind of light headed
Maybe I'll write her a letter in a gentleman's way
And send it with the hopes that she might get it
I can't believe I let her run all over me
But all I think about is
When she's here and holding me
I love her
She's the reason for the lesions
Man, I love her
I start bleeding when she's leaving
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned
All my missions trying to find her and
I can't complain
I kind of like the pain
She ain't even got a name
She just lives in my brain

She says she loves me
But she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts
It's like another papercut
And now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
Til she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades
Claims she loves me
But she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up
Here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of bandaids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades.....
Man, them niggas can't fuck with you, man, fuck them niggas man
I know, I, I, I know
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't
Fuck with my damn self
I know, I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me I
I know y'all niggas
Ungh, got-damn it took a nigga
Thirteen motherfucking years through this shit
Bruh, I been rappin since La-Di-Da-Di some fucking where
I know y'all niggas I know y'all niggas I know y'all niggas
Aw shit, it's on nigga
I'm still not that nigga to fuck with buster, bad for your ho health
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
See can't nobody fly, through the swamp and bayou, like I do
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me and they can't but they try to
Some niggas just need to be warned
It's gonna be harder to get it up on a my own
Nigga go ring the alarm
Matter fact better know what it take
For the back of your head to hit that grass
Let' s get this straight from the jump
I ain't playing with your bitch ass
These outside niggas that run to the mic better come clean
Fuckin with that Saudi Arabian
Desert Storm veteran 12th ward offspring
I'm runnin these niggas to the jets
To the hills, to the back of the tracks
A-A-ask them hoes, did I do that?
I'm coming boisterous with 5 million switches
I'm the man with single and double and triple
And four five six time them bitches
I'm the nigga with the go head, fuckin your bitch up in your bed
Standin 5 foot 'leven dick crooked like a roach leg
Much bone and I don't fail a test
Little nigga fuck hoes both sides of the river
I can't be fucked with, you can't touch this better grab hold
Bitch I'm so cold I'm like a 24 year-old north pole
Give a fuck about these raggly ass hoes
Grippin my nuts as I strut in my baggy ass Girbauds
Makin em stop, (bigidabounce) pause, Like Jubilee All
I'm harder than a nigga watchin' Janet Jackson in draws
But if ya catch me on the tv, or the radio spell it
M-Y-S-T-I-K-A-L y'all ain't ready though
I'm still not that nigga to fuck with buster, bad for your ho health
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
I'm still not that nigga to fuck with buster, bad for your ho health
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
So Mystikal, in your own words could you explain your style?
I gotta get a rhyme that can tumble through the air like a Rambo spear
See y'all can stop lookin at another nigga
Face cause bitch the man right here
You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine
Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying)
Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind
Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein
I'm fire like Cayenne
You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena
Gimme the chance I'll rock the lakefront arena
Like Teena Marie be rockin Tipitina's (damn Gina)
Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner
It's all in the way I lay my game down
Watch me swing with the gillotine rollin round nigga town
But everybody think these niggas be wantin me
To prove that I'm the man
Bitch I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan
I got no love for no b-i-e-otch
Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin osh kosh b'gosh
But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me
When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me
Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do
Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do
One never gonna change my style
Two never gonna bounce, three never gonna bow
I'm gettin tired of being sick and tired
Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high
Suck big dick and die
Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade
The tan shade man with the braids
Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward
I done offended these niggas compare me
To niggas that gotta practice looking hard
Bitch-a won't leave me alone
I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone
Black prince of the south that's my title
Bitch I'm whoo chka ckha oooooww! bad like Michael
I'm throwin rhymes at a steady flow
(Inhaling) whoo there they go y'all niggas ain't ready yo
I'm still not that nigga to fuck with buster, bad for your ho health
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
Bitch I pimp hoes instead of an army petty shit it don't harm me
Bitch I'm entertaining like Cedric and I'm mac like Bernie
I'm black like Menace and I'm g like Slimm
I'm Sporty like T and I'm smooth like Tim
I can click just like the boot camp but I'm conscious like daughter
Bitch I'm insane but um, you still be wantin
To claim that I'm your partner
I'm Down just like Bust plus I'm Ice just like Mike
And I'm the living lyrical miracle I'm just ice like precise
I'm the invisible man you blind you can't see shit
Picture I got more bitches on my dick than bitches at FREAKNIK

[Intro]
Yo yo, yeah
It's almost over now
Almost over now
It's almost over now
Almost over now

[Verse 1]
You think the way you live is okay
You think posin'
Will save the day
You think we don't see
That you're running
Better call your boys
Cause I'm coming

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
Yes, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Verse 2]
You had plenty of time
There was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wait
I'm standing there

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
Yes, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Verse 3]
You don't succeed cause you hesitate
You think we're fly
But we levitate
Just be yourself
Don't ask us why
Cause if you don't we'll make you fly

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now
It's almost over now
I guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now
Almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Hook]
You can't be me
I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now
It's almost over now
I guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now

[Outro]
No one Ever Really Dies
Do you believe that?
Well if not, for you, it's almost over now, almost over now

That is not the way I get
That is not the way it goes
That is not the way I get
That is not the way it goes

That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down

Th-th-that is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down

Th-th-that is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down

I wanna see you choke on your lies (lies, lies)
Suffer all alone in your (lone in your, lone in your)
Choke on your lies (lies, lies)
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies (lies, lies)
Suffer all alone in your (lone in your, lone in your)
Choke on your lies (lies, lies)
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself

I wanna see you-
Exactly how the breaking point sounds
I wanna
That is not the way I get
I wanna see you-
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

I wanna see you choke on your lies (lies, lies)
Suffer all alone in your (lone in your, lone in your)
Choke on your lies (lies, lies)
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself (x8)

I wanna see you-
Exactly how the breaking point sounds
Imma be that nail in your coffin
Sayin' that I soften
I was duckin' down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience
Before you even say it I know
You let your pride or your ego
Talk slick to me no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now let me show you
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

I wanna see you-
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down

Th-th-that is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
That is not the way I get down
That is not the way it goes down
I'm stuck in this bed you made, alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said to the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face, all the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take and take and take you never say

No, you've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down, you push it back down!
No, you'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

You say that it's not your fault and swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems, no remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall, suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take and take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

No, you've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down, you push it back down!
No, you'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!
No, you've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down, you push it back down!
No, you'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

Blackout / Blood in your eye
You push it back down / Push it back
You push it back down / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye
Blackout / Blood in your eye

Floating down as colours fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paper white
And floating up you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite

So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down, Oh..
Come down, Oh..
Come down, Oh..
Come down, Oh..
Come down, Oh..
Getting hard to remember, getting hard to recall
Getting laid off and pushed out and it ain't my baby's fault

So if you go, don't cry, I'll be right there at your side
Sherrill, Sherrill

Getting laid on the lifeline, getting tired, time for bed
And there's no use getting worked up, I'll remember all you said

And if you go, don't cry, I'll be right there at your side
Sherrill, Sherrill, Sherrill, Sherrill

[Intro: Rico Wade]
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothin' but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking about a black man heaven here
You know what I'm saying? Yeah

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books, I thought you knew so now you know
Let's go

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes ‘cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um…

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one…

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday

[Interlude: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day e’ryday

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give 'em

Drink a six pack and then you play som ball
Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
Two hundred seventy five punds that you can't forget

Heart attack, heart attack man
Spend all your money on your health insurance plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Keep on getting bigger because you know that you can

Why do you force yourself on top of that girl
Laugh with all your buddies because it's a man's man's world
Someday that shit will come back to you
You've been throwing your weight around and
Your shit is through

Heart attack, heart attack man
Going nowhere, got no master plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Heart attack
Weighs in at two seventy five
Yeh my man is lucky to be alive
Smokin' and drinkin' too
My man the heart attack man is gonna be running over you
Got no god damn respect
Had to put the big big bitch-ass in check

Heart attack, heart attack man
Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam
Heart attack, heart attack man
Time to change your ways heart attack man

What do we know about partying or anything else?
You know, you know listen to me
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
That's true, so true, you're the only girl I love to
But my heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
So true, so true, listen
I wasn't tryin to lead her on
See I didn't want to be alone
But when she smiles she brought me home
So I brought her home
It's not that the feelin' of love is gone
Can't expect a college girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And I'm not lookin' 'round
So why you lookin' down
What you lookin' down for?
I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say
As the People Magazine and crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
Hove got a young girl
Hove got a young girl, still not quite 21
So high strung, such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, "Hi miss thing"
You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows, screams of horror
Classic Steven King novel
Mama don't think you should take someone
So advanced in romance, you should just wait
Papa don't preach, hove don't fight
Hopin' threw it I might mo your life
'Cause I'ma show you right
Proper etiquette and how to hold your knife
Keep it competitive with Opras ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, I'm never to young)
Young girl, so in love with you
('Cause I'm never too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
('Cause I'm never too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, I'm never to young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
('Cause I'm never too young)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
This is where the story begins baby
There were flashing lights when we met
Not the typical place you would be
In a flash of time my mind was set
I knew you were the girl there for me
And though you just wanted to leave
Imagine how great it could be
The F U T U R E, spells the future girl
Sit down hold your horses don't leave, where you going girl?
Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave
I really like you girl
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe
But just don't leave me girl
I really like you girl, girl
From the moment that we met
I really like you girl, oh, girl
I know it Susan
Against the wall is where you lean
The most beautiful girl that I've seen
Out of this world, my God, you bling
I'm surprised that you are a human being
And though you just wanted to leave
Imagine how great it could be
The F U T U R E, spells the future girl
Sit down hold your horses don't leave, where you going girl?
Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave
I really like you girl
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe
But just don't leave me girl
I really like you girl, girl
From the moment that we met
I really like you girl, oh, girl
I know it Susan
Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave
I really like you girl
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe
But just don't leave me girl
I really like you girl, girl
From the moment that we met
I really like you girl, oh, girl
I know it Susan
Yo, I think I got the one now
Never me man, never me, never in a million years
But I do

[Intro: Big Boi]
Yeah, uh, East Point smokes some dank
College Park in the house, Decatur
Uh, Old National got the skanks
Everybody, know'm'sayin'
Check it

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving a shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

[Chorus]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us 'cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

[Chorus]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (Zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay

[Chorus]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

When I signed my deal
I felt pressure
Don't want to see the numbers
I want to see heaven
You say could you write a song for me
I said I'm sorry I won't do that happily
When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for
I do it for the love
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind

I do it for the love
I do it for the love

Please don't get me wrong
I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires
I'm not foolish
Please can you make this work for me
'Cause I'm not a puppet I will work against your strings
When I go home
I tend to close the door
I never wanted more
So sing with me
Can't you see
I don't have
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for

[Verse 1]
Maybe your jacket is a hand-me down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares maybe you're just round

[Chorus 1]
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea

[Verse 2]
Maybe you're working at a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are

[Chorus 1]
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like the bitter, some the sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so you might as well just make it how you please

[Bridge]
Oh, maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail
Or maybe you failed out of college
But, hey, life goes on
And we've all got the right to be wrong

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black, some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
'Cause you can't be everybody's cup of tea
Why would you wanna be?

[Verse 1]
When it rains it pours, but you didn't even notice
It ain't raining anymore, it's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of staying above, the rising water line

[Chorus]
The sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

[Verse 2]
If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colours
Yellow, red and orange and green, and at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat and take a look around

[Chorus]
Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

[Bridge]
So tie up the boat, take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now

[Chorus]
Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head
Yeah there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

[Verse 1]
Well, off the walls with these raps
Better call ya homies off, cause we back
Had it locked all along, I'm not falling off
I'm too smart to fall for these traps
Sitting in the parking lot, my seat back
Getting topped off some mornings, freeze that
Gotta be a God with all of these racks
I don't wanna talk to y'all, the flow Alcamo
And I'm finding this hard to relax
Wonder where my mind has gone, I've seemed sad
When you try'na hide from us, I'm the final boss, and the chance for y'all to feed Mac
Bitches started, wanna be that
Homie you be lying wanna be all I spit facts
These motherfuckers wanna hold me back
And they got me blinded all I see's fact
Talking 'bout a rematch, I be in the belly of the beast playing Dreamcast
Tell me where the weed at
Get that up, little homie don't need that
I forgot my head, skip to my lou bitch
I jumped off the ledge
I like to geek by myself, this is no cry for help
I jumped off of the deep end
Me and my homies we out here
There's not much around here
Come jump off the deep end

[Bridge] (x2)
We really do this (music, music, music, music, music, music) yeah

[Hook]
These motherfuckers can't fuck with my style
Human like me though, you don't come around me
Verses get buried six feet underground
I been waiting so long for what's coming now
And fuck what you heard
You want to see realness then come to the 'Burgh
It's up in the air, but be sure that everything we do is pure
When will these motherfuckers learn?
When will these motherfuckers learn?
When will these motherfuckers learn?

[Verse 2]
Y'all is boring, I've been scoring with a foreign-born model
Shooting porno then I fall asleep
All the Z's Zorro, I'm not sure though
Why did Lizzie McGuire never fuck Gordo?
Eating sushi, copping Toro
We surviving, it's a war zone out here
See, I'm far from normal out here
Rocking fleece when I'm on the beach, I snorkel out here
Yes I'm weird, do not fear the other world that I revere
And stay clear of all the bad guys, cool you in the clear
In the rain, I ain't scared, shit I really can't complain
I don't like what's down the drain, but it's cool, let me explain
I'm alive, I'm okay, do not entertain the lies that they say
You gon' find your way, we just take up space here

[Verse 1]
Annie knows when it's me
Knows how I'm feeling and gives me her healing
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

[Verse 2]
Annie, daddy won't let me
Daddy won't let me go and that's why I feel so low
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

[Intro]
You will die
We walk through the fire
Just to die
Just to die

[Verse 1]
And the hope I had for the first time in my life
I let it die

[Chorus]
I wanted to love you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
I wanted to hold you
But in my heart
There is nothing left

[Verse 2]
I thought that we were important
But we don't matter at all
At all

[Bridge]
Put your hands on my face
One last time
And say goodbye

[Chorus]
I wanted to love you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
I wanted to hold you
But in my heart
There is nothing left

[Refrain]
I don't want to say goodbye
But I have to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I wanted to love you
But in my heart
There is nothing left
I wanted to hold you
But in my heart
There is nothing left

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I crave my own demise
When I wake to when I fall asleep
I'm stuck between nothing and nothing

[Chorus]
United States National Park
Oh, don't leave me here all alone by the campfire
United States National Park
I don't want to die alone by the campfire

[Verse 2]
They say, "Life is beautiful"
But what does that mean?
I don't want to say anything
That would make you believe in nothing

[Chorus]
United States National Park
But don't leave me here alone by the campfire
United States National Park
I don't wanna die alone by the campfire

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
United States National Park
Oh, don't leave me here alone by the campfire
United States National Park
I don't wanna die alone by the campfire

[Verse 1]
I know I supposed to forget you
But I don't know how
And I know I supposed to forget you
Somebody tell me how

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
I've seen everyone
And you're not everyone

[Chorus]
I buried you deep in my heart
I buried you deep in my heart
I buried you deep in my heart
I buried you deep in my heart

[Verse 2]
It takes everything in me
To make you happy
You take what I have to give
'Till I feel empty
And I'll keep coming back to be with you
Like the morning sun

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Back in those towns, as the stars come out
People go to their homes and the lights come on
I sigh with the trees and walk past the windows
And feel the cold a little more than I did
More than before

[Bridge]
I put my hands inside my pockets
And wish that I were them
But I don't know
I was so sure
But I'm not anymore
Unless you stay close to me

[Chorus]
Like the wild geese
That fly through the thunder
Onward and upward
Through the clouds
Away from the rain
And the wind that blows us down
When the sky turns black
When the wolves run back
We'll just wait here for
The first lights of morning
You and me
We're like those geese
Out in the thunder

[Verse 2]
Back in those towns, it's all familiar
It's what I know
But I was always on my own
No-one beside me on train rides
Through the countryside

[Bridge]
I put my hands inside my pockets
And wish that I were them
But I don't know
I was so sure
But I'm not anymore

[Chorus]
Now, you and me
Were like the wild geese
That fly through the thunder
Onward and upward
Through the clouds
Away from the rain
And the wind that blows us down
When the sky turns black
When the wolves run back
We'll just wait here for
The first lights of morning
You and me
We're like those geese
Out in the thunder

[Verse 1]
At an early age
You locked yourself away
And became the architect of your fate
And there's something strange
Strangely wonderful to create and conduct on your way

[Pre-Chorus]
In your lonely world
You have no boundaries there
You have no one to share your love with
Wendy

[Chorus]
In your lonely world
You have no boundaries there
You have no one to share your love with
Wendy, oh

[Verse 2]
Shudder at the thought
Of you all alone in your studio, uptown in the cold
Why they despise you so, and spread those lies I'll never know
But don't pay them any heed

[Pre-Chorus]
In your lonely world
You have no boundaries there
You have no one to share your love with
Wendy

[Chorus]
In your lonely world
You have no boundaries there
You have no one to share your love with
Wendy, oh

[Verse 1]
Kiss the hand of Satan when I kiss you
Feel his cold breath on my neck when I’m near you
His eyes on my eyes tonight

[Chorus](x2)
I saw the face of god
He showed me how to live
I threw it back at him
I threw it back at him
I saw the face of god
He showed me how to live
I threw it back at him
I threw it back at him

[Verse 2]
Inside the mountain
You are gentle
You are gentle
His eyes are always on me
Always lookin’

[Chorus]
I saw the face of god
He showed me how to live
I threw it back at him
I threw it back at him
I saw the face of god
He showed me how to live
I threw it back at him
I threw it back at him

[Verse 1]
A clock ticks on the wall
A knife spins in the Dark
He's closing his eyes for the last time
He's going to be her

[Chorus]
They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themselves
They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themself

[Refrain 1]
Let me let me see who you are
Let me let me see who you are

[Verse 2]
A clock ticks on the wall
She loves another girl
She open her eyes for the first Time
She's going to love her

[Chorus]
They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themselves
They might hate you, but I love you
And they can go kill themself

[Refrain 1]
Let me let me see who you are
Let me let me see who you are

[Refrain 2]
A clock ticks on the wall
A knife spins in the Dark

[Refrain 1]
Let me let me see who you are
Let me let me see who you are

[Outro]
See who you are
See who you are

[Verse 1]
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait for you

[Chorus]
I'll sing that melody
That you used to sing
I'll sing that melody
That we used to sing

[Verse 2]
Where did you go
You haven't even called
Oh, where can I find
The only one who can
Break my heart, break my heart
Break it and make it hurt
Break my heart, break my heart

[Verse 3]
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait for you

[Chorus]
I'll sing that melody
That you used to sing
I'll sing that melody
That we used to sing

[Verse 4]
What is the point
Of living with that you
Oh, in my life
These days just feel like nights

[Verse 5]
Break my heart, break my heart
Break it and make it hurt
Break my heart, break my heart

[Verse 3]
I'll sing it in my heart
While I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart

I'll be waiting here
For you

Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
I cannot complain today
Because I'm around you
And I could not look the other way
Because I love you

[Verse 1]
And it's hard to admit
But deep in my cold heart
There's a voice that screams out
And it's screaming

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again

[Verse 2]
Blissful ignorance
Let me sink into it for once
Like a child
Let me feel like a child

[Verse 3]
And it's hard not to be ashamed
But deep in my stone heart
There's a voice that screams out
And it's screaming

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Eeh eeh, ooh ooh, ahh ahh
Kiss me again, kiss me again
Kiss me again, kiss me again

[Verse 4]
Oh oh
I never want to go
I want to stay right here

[Refrain]
I wanna be here so long
I wanna be here for so long
I wanna be here so long

Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From me

[Verse 1]
You must be tired
You're workin' hard
And I'm happy you told me
You don't believe in hell

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to be alone, it's sickening
What you want is a family (Aah-oh)

[Chorus]
Don't look away
From me
Don't look away
From me

[Verse 2]
Oh you were a quiet child
You were a sweet boy
And even when they beat you down
You never dropped your sword

You don't have to be alone, it's sickening
What you want is a family (Aah-oh)

Don't look away
From me

I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again
And I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again

[Verse 1]
And I don’t really understand
What you’re after
Cause I was looking for you
Only looking for you

[Verse 2]
We used to feel
Like the world was passing us by
But now it’s only you that’s passing me by
It’s only you that’s passing me by
It's only you that's passing me by
It's only you that's passing me by

[Chorus]
I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again
And I just stood there in the cold
I just stood there in the cold
I know I won’t see you again
I won’t see you again

[Intro]
Those days when I would sit around with you
There's nothing like it
And even when my heart was black and blue
There's nothing like it
And everything before and after you
It doesn't cut it

[Pre-Chorus]
So do you remember the old times
Those were the only times, the only times

[Chorus]
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here

[Verse 1]
You never have to say that you were wrong
I know I'd do it all again
Even if it was wrong
And I could write a thousand more songs about you
Before this one's done
The next one's begun

[Pre-Chorus]
So do you remember the old times
Those were the only times, the only times

[Chorus]
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here

[Verse 2]
And how will this end
And when will my life begin
Again, again, again, again

[Pre-Chorus]
So do you remember the old times
Those were the only times, the only times

[Chorus]
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here
I don't know how it ended
I don't know where you ran to
I'll always be right here

[Verse 1]
You’re like a child and I like that
You’re always sleeping on my doorstep
And you’re such a pretty thing
And I like that

[Verse 2]
You’re like a child and I like that
You’re always pushing me so close to death
And it’s such a stupid thing
But I like that

[Pre-Chorus]
But you torture me
And you ruin me

[Chorus]
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you

[Verse 3]
That night you put your lipstick on me
I felt stupid so I drank to get dizzy
And when you fell asleep
I threw a tambourine at your face
And of course I missed
Cause I always miss
Yeah I always miss
Yeah I always miss

[Pre-Chorus]
But you torture me
And you ruin me

[Chorus]
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you

[Refrain]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Feels so bad
Feels so bad

[Chorus]
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you
I need a doctor
I need a doctor
You know I love you
But I wanna kill you

[Intro]
If he forgets you
He forgets you for good
If you wanna feel
Better start searching some more
Because it was a happy time
Now it’s winter time
And you’re cold

[Chorus]
If he likes it let him do it
If he likes it let him do it

[Verse 1]
I could never be a soldier
So I won’t make you stand so tall
And tonight’s the night
When there’s light in your eyes
And you say goodbye
Or I die

[Chorus](x3)

[Verse 1]
And I can’t meet you tonight
I can’t meet you tonight
I found the difference between
What I wanted it to be
And what it will always be
The things I used to feel I don’t feel anymore
The things I used to say I don’t say anymore
I drop my hands down slowly
Because what I was searching for
Cannot be found

[Verse 2]
We were searching for heaven
We were searching for heaven
We were searching for heaven
Will we dream again
Will we dream again

[Intro]
You told me
How the world will end
And I believed you
Because I always do
And you said to me
They don’t stand a chance
Only we do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want to lose what we have
I don’t think you know how good it is

[Chorus](x2)
Please don’t leave
Please don’t leave
Where will I go
Where will I go

[Verse 1]
The people look at me
With a little sympathy
Cause it won’t end
This chapter won’t end
I won’t let go
Of what I’m holding
I won’t let go
I can’t let go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus](x2)

[Refrain](x9)
I won’t let go
Now I won’t let go

[Chorus](x2)

[Verse 1]
Tell me why when you look me in the eye
Do I feel like I want to die?
I've been at work all day in the pouring rain
Just to give you something you'll forget

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love

[Chorus]
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
But you're hard to love

[Verse 2]
And I don't know why after all this time
Every single song I sing is about you
And you walk away, you just walk away
But I still make your bed, and you still leave me for dead

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love

[Chorus]
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
But you're hard to love

[Bridge]
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away
Away-away, away-away, away-away, away-away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love

[Chorus]
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love, you're hard to love
You're hard to love

[Verse 1]
They said
You were a mystery
I know
You can’t fool me

[Pre-Chorus]
But still I cave in
I gave you my heart
I cave in
I gave you my heart

[Chorus]
Well hang on, hang on
I know you don’t think I know
Well hold on, hold on
But I know but I know but I know

[Post-Chorus]
I always knew what you were
I always knew what you were

[Verse 2]
You came along
You came along
I got into your car
You came along
I knew I was wrong
I knew I would die

[Pre-Chorus]
But still I cave in
I gave you my heart
I cave in
I gave you my heart

[Chorus]
Well hang on, hang on
I know you don’t think I know
Well hold on, hold on
But I know but I know but I know

[Post-Chorus]
I always knew what you were
I always knew what you were

[Chorus]
Well hang on, hang on
I know you don’t think I know
Well hold on, hold on
But I know but I know but I know

[Post-Chorus]
I always knew what you were
I always knew what you were

[Verse 1]
Here I go again
Getting upset over nothing
Getting upset over your heart
Over your heart
Over your heart
And if I ruled the world
I would make every country salute you
And if I ruled the world
I'd make you be mine

[Chorus]
And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Set me free

[Verse 2]
Here you go again
Walking away like it's nothing
Walking away from my heart
But I see your eyes at night
And you know what's wrong
And you know what's right

[Chorus]
And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Set me free

[Bridge]
The future
Oh, oh
The future
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Set me free

[Intro]
I wish your mind was more like your heart
Nailed shut
Looking back, can't remember too much love

[Chorus]
Now when I fall down
When I get weak
When I grow tired
I'll never drop my sword

[Verse 1]
Tell me a sadder story
So I can fall asleep
The right way, if I knew the right away
Well, we wouldn't be here

[Chorus]
Now when I fall down
When I get weak
When I grow tired
I'll never drop my sword

[Outro]
Do you think Jesus loves me?
Can I go home again?
I'm a boy

[Verse 1]
Baby, I know you hate me so
I gave you everything, why do you hate me so?

[Chorus]
I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

[Verse 2]
Baby, you took my soul
I gave you everything, what did you give my soul?

[Chorus]
I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

[Refrain]
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears

I don't feel sorry when you cry
I don't believe you when you lie
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Saying goodbye

It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears
It will all end in tears

We, we are in love
And we forever
We not gonna stop
We'll be forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the stars in the sky
And all the flowers in the fields
And all the flower in the earth
Could never take you from my heart

[Chorus]

And it's forever, baby it's forever
And let me run till the end of time

When we're together
We, we are the young
We live forever

[Verse 1]
I know you're trying to kill me
I know you're trying to kill me
'Cause you're chasing me around town
Until I turn around
Yeah, you're chasing me around town
Until I turn around

[Chorus]
I cannot take any more
Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

I cannot take any more
Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

[Verse 2]
I know you're trying to kiss me
I know you're really trying to kill me
'Cause you're driving me around town
In your car
You drive it off a bridge and crash it to the ground
You're following me 'round town until I turn around

I cannot take any more
Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

I cannot take any more
Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

I cannot take any more
Do you want me to skip town
Do you want me to come 'round

[Verse 1]
I felt so stupid, you were standing there
You were combing your hair so unaware
I felt so silly, you could see me
I know you love your family, I'm sure you love your family
But come stay with me, stay with me

[Chorus]
I don't know if it's right or wrong
But come stay with me, I wanna hear every beat of your heart
If it's good or bad, come be with me
And I'll give you every key to my
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-a-ah (x4) heart

[Verse 2]
Your arms around me seem to be
The only good thing that ever happened to me
We can take a walk now, down to the beach
The sun will be shining where we're finally free

And have I lived my life too selfishly, baby?

One weekend you're acting crazy

This ain't what I thought it would be
This is the saddest summer ever
The saddest summer ever

Put me in the submarine
And push it into the sea
Let it sink down
Down, down
I remember everything
Racing you across the bridge
I was running, I was sweating, I was falling
And then you kissed me, it was crazy
But that was yesterday
That was not today
But that was yesterday
That was not today

[Chorus]
I did not want to let you go
But I knew I had to
I did not want to let you go
But I knew I had to

And I remember everything
I even loved your family
All I've ever given you was love

Down, Down

It's out of love (no it's not), it's out of love (no it's not)

[Verse 1]
Every day I ride my bike
Up and down these roads
I see a beautiful flower
It was trampled on the ground
And it makes me think of you
How you used to be and who you are now
Oh, Jenny, how you are now
Oh, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny

[Chorus]

Oh, you used to be so pretty
But now you're just tragic
Believe in something
You're full of horse shit

No it's not

"Hello, welcome to the party"
"Hi, I've never met you before."
"I know."

Just 2 guys and we're having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time
Just 2 guys and we're having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time

[Verse 1: Jorma, Akiva]
We'll burn the roof off, this party's going off
You think that we're soft? You get tossed
Guy Number One, I love to dance
My fancy feet moves putting you in a trance
It's a friend thing, friends are everywhere!
In the kitchen, the den, hanging out on the stairs!
Spinach dip, real hot chicks
Spike the punch and take a sip
Guy Number Two, come to chill with you
P-A-R-T-WHY? 'Cause we got to!
I like playing games in the pool
Who invited Steve? That dude's a cunt!

[Chorus: Jorma & Akiva]
Just 2 guys and we're having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time
Just 2 guys and we're having a good time
Having a good time, having a good time

Now everyone in the house, say Guy Number One
Guy Number One!
Now everyone in the house, say Guy Number Two
