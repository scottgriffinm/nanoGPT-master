ng corruption
I said it before, I am the sky
My feet the struggle, tryn' keep peace on my mind
But recently Sweat had scuffle, been heated with mine
Swear it's my voice of reason that only beat up my pride
Like half the time that I needed it
The feelin' like I'm the only one I'm cheating would creep up my spine
My nigga frontin' like these substances ain't weaken my drive
Crock-bowl full of bitches tryna eat up my time
Stop snitching motherfucker, keep a leash on your dime
Stop dropping 'em, bitch-ass niggas
Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Kanye West]
Woman arrested for gettin' naked

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Barrel straight through the peephole
Tell your parents that we home
Propaganda that we own
Crime infested, not contested
Block conventions and street zones
My redemption won't be long (woman)
My religion, fear no man (arrested)
Warrior, Conan, oh man (for gettin')
Horror stories and romance (naked)
Devils that like to slow dance
Kettles burnin' with sin in them
Children don't wanna hold hands
Tourists don't wanna visit and purists die in the maulin'
Fire burnin' through skylines
Follow fortune through guidelines
Bloody Jordans and Popeye's
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high
More divorces and child support lawyers, callin' you, "Dada"
Feds tap on your wifi (skrrt)
Meds makin' you crazy, you dip your head in some agua
Hit the dip while you're drinkin' it
Fuck it, flip on the stop sign
Duck a clip in that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the Honda
Sell a brick to a minor
Makin' wishes for Jannah
Pump your fist up far higher
Reminiscin' bout Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
Welcome to America's future, the great ruler (woman)
Public Enemy's first born, ready to shoot you

[Outro: Kanye West]
I hate when people at me
I'm hurt, so, nigga, don't at me

[Intro: T-Pain]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me (that's me)
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be (I be)
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID (ID)
That's me, baby
That's me, baby

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Time we back into this one of a kind spirit
We remembered in the time, we the skies and the limit
Bitch, I'm barely in my prime, this ain't half a division
Got so much shit on my mind I'm mentally in a prison
I'm a man on a mission until I'm out of commission
And when we speaking, they listen
Keys for my kingdom of wisdom
Man, my mommy was tripping, thought I'd be bringing in children
Instead I brought in a million, new home and a ceiling
My empire keep rising, enterprises is building
But the stacks keep on piling, I'm never losing the feeling
My life on autopilot, the world is making me numb
I put my phone on silent just so that I could be one
Knew the day would come when I was finally here
Show the kinger stone, this went a couple of years
I ain't got no fears, now that we made that clear
Let's put one in the air, I'm taking over from here

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me (that's me)
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be (I be)
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID (ID)
That's me, baby
That's me, baby

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Time to let the dumb fucks have it (okay)
Uncut, somewhat magic, e'rything about the come up was classic
We'd run and cut classes, gun tuck habit
21 Savage and the drummers on some trap shit
Wait, fuck fame I laid a little back
Feel I was ahead of my time, they ain't saying that
Bad bitch calling her Snoop, I make her take a cab
She gon' doggy style all night, she hate laying flat
Yup, to me it sound like a win-win
Group text, you chicks free and get a win-win
Back to my legacy, it's longevity
It's ten bathrooms in a mansion that I never see
Shots come my way, that's my speciality
If they ever said my name, it wasn't said to me
Plus, I never half-ass in the game
When both Joe's is badass you get pain

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me (that's me)
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be (I be)
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID (ID)
That's me, baby
That's me, baby

Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

Rapology Twelve
Disc of Lee Cadena

And your fatass mama
Kenji and DJ Artofficial representing Xero
Cash double oh
Styles Of Beyond
Junkyard Scientific
Rhetoric
Ashkon
And Usher

[Mike Shinoda]
Let's give a hand for my man
Now it's my turn to spit shit
These syllabolic ballistics spending rhythmic existence
It's twisted
That when my pens passively takes this down
Systematically smashing and hammering one category of sound
Into the next
Can you and I see in a defensive fashion
Attacking emcees and back and neck muscle contraction whiplashes
It's synchronization with the tempo created when rhythms meet
This musical fitness workout, rhyme and beat moving your feet
Packing trash bags with action making every fraction of a sentence hectic
With the IMAX armed division letterbox widescreen perspective
Lee Cadena's Urban Network Rapology Twelve collective
Kenji and Artofficial and Xero keeping you pop progressive

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Verse 1]
By the time you read this (Oh)
Probably will've self-destructed (Ooh)
Never say anything constructive
And all I am, I am, I can't fuck with
(No, no, no, no)
New love is simple
And old love is fragile
I lost all my reverence for you somewhere in the middle
(You so different now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Usually, I could fix shit
Got to fix shit
Can't forget the things you said
All that I guess is stay, no, stay

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Verse 2]
It'd be different if you wasn't my man foreal
We wasn't hangin' out (Boy)
We wasn't playin' house (Boy)
Everything casual boy
It's more serious than I thought
Bit more commitment than I bargained for
(For, for, for, for)

[Pre-Chorus]
Usually, I could fix shit
Got to fix shit
Can't forget the things you said
All that I guess is stay, no, stay

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Bridge]
I need some time to cool off it well
What I want it ain't you no more
I need some time to figure out
Who I really am without you, 'cause
Really I am without you

[Chorus]
I lost my passport
But it's okay
We weren't going nowhere anyway, anyway
I lost my passport
And it's okay
This relationship's going nowhere anyway, anyway

[Outro]
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'
You're never gonna say 'I do'

[Chorus]
I can think of a million reasons, have it all as your seasons
Say no more I feel ya b, say no more I feel ya homie
We traveled the Neverlands, fireworks in the south of France
Take it down and come again, again
But look
You don't get too dirty in my whip. whip, whip, whip
Keep it nice and flirty in my whip, whip, whip whip
Pop your pretty ass up in my whip, we gonna make it last up in my whip
Scorpio, talk to me, talk to me
Capricorn, talk to me, talk to me
Sister you can bang on your tambourine
Just let my body be fed
At the end of our street
Is a mission so sweet
Where me and all my friends
Get a little something to eat

Though you can't pick and choose
You sure like their stew
And if you don't get fried chicken
What you get you can use

Praise the Lord and pass the soup
Praise the Lord and pass the bread

For the sake of a prayer
There's a warm welcome there
And if you ain't had a bath
Ain't no body who cares
Cause they've seen it all before
From the bums to the whores
And if you shout "Hallelujah"
They'll sometimes give you some more
And singin' hallelujah

[Intro]
Now it might just seem
But I know my eyes ain't tripping (nah)
My momma told me I'm a beast

Pussy nigga really need a new job, ain't being funny, nigga

Feel like the world, feel like the world against me

I'd cry
If you leave me sad and blue
I'd cry
If you ever say we're through
I'd cry
If it can't be me and you
Lonely tears I'd shed
I'd hang my head

I'd cry
Like a little bitty babe
I'd cry
If you ever walked away
I'd cry
If you call it a day
I'd cry for years
I'd drown in tears

Oh, sugar baby, I love you so
I need you more than you know
And if I ever had to let you go
I'd sit around, I'd break right down
I'd cry
Deep down in my heart
I'd cry
If you leave me, tears would start
I'd cry
Every day that we're apart
I'd cry a river
Don't you leave me ever

Baby, you really send me
Flame of love burns within me
I'd be sad as I can be
If I had to do without you

[Harmonica solo]

I'd cry
If you ever put me down
I'd cry
If you ever play around
I'd cry
It will fall to the ground
I'd fall apart
If you break my heart

Oh, I love you love you
More than words can say
Love you more and more each day
If you ever ever walk away
I couldn't go on
I'd sit at home
I'd cry
Like a little bitty babe
I'd cry
If you ever walked away
I'd cry
If you call it a day
I'd cry for years
I'd drown in tears

I'd cry
If you leave me sad and blue
I'd cry
If you ever say we're through
I'd cry
If it can't be me and you
Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

People stop and stare at me
I don't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes, yeah
Bankin' off of the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
Oh yeah...

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain, yeah
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
You know it's gotta suit my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
Hey...
Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

Everybody's talkin' at Stevie
But he don't hear a word they're sayin'
And I ain't gonna let you leave my love behind
Oh yeah...

[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
People think you're stuck up, but we're all super good friends
It's only natural, I suppose, but we're all super good friends
Um, I get the feeling that you're admired, but, um
I'm above average

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company's bad for your company
Bad company's bad for your company
Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me
Got the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB]
When I say I got beef, they don't want no beef
When they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat
If he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam
She put a V on her tee, bad bad bad bad bad
Had a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed
Fix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem
Hit up Bloc (Brrr), "yo' this Flack, nigga, where you at?
Pin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app"

[Interlude: BlockBoy JB]
I need money and company, nah nah
Bad bitches, I don't even know the company, hahahaha

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
You—you—you can't hang baby, we don't want you 'round here
I—ice on my neck and it's froze, Santa's reindeer
Y—you got bad bitches, hella hoes, i—i—it's the same here
You bad company, lil' bro, you can't hang here
G—g—g—gettin' money so the bottles keep on comin'
Ph—ph—pho—pho—phone ringin' so you know the trap jumpin'
Tha—tha—that nigga lookin' at me, he owe me some money
Hit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'
Why—why these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me
My shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me
Might have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'
Them niggas were opposition
They move wrong, so I shot them bitches

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Dark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes
Actin' brand new like I don't see you when I do
Who them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room
Phony folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Flintstone bust down, color Murakami
Fruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney
Bad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie
Wrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me
I'ma come clean, I got hella beef
Paranoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm uppin' up the fees
Whole team got V's on they tees, all day

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I'm above average
I'm his little downtown baby doll
I'm his little downtown baby doll
He likes to come and hear me sing rock and roll
And watch me when I'm workin' on the silver pole

I'm his little downtown baby doll
Doesn't mind what I do for work at all
'Cause you live like you're rich when you're beautiful
I fill it up, work it out, night falls, I'm a star

If you want it supersize, I can do that for ya
If you want it double fries, I can do that for ya
If you want a cola, I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl, uh, nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen of New York
Then you better call me, me

I'm his little downtown baby doll
Trouble on the train at the festival
Come and get your girl, yo, he gets the call
Come and picks me up at the Bowery Ball
I'm his little downtown baby doll
Everybody tells him I'm trouble, y'all
Doesn't really care 'cause he likes to fall
You know the working girls? I'm the worst of them all

If you want it supersize, I can do that for ya
If you want it double fries, I can do that for ya
If you want a cola, I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl, uh, nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen of New York
Then you better call me, me

Little girl, you gonna get me fired
Lucky for you that I'm so inspired
By every way you move and the things that you do
I think that I gotta hold onto you

Say yeah, yeah, I say yeah, you
Say yeah, yeah, I say yeah, you

If you want it supersize, I can do that for ya
If you want it double fries, I can do that for ya
If you want a cola, I can make it colder
If you want a bad girl, uh, nobody's bolder
And if you want the queen of New York
Then you better call me, me

[Verse 1: Logic]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and—
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 3: Logic]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well, Logic, he gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
"Can you hear me?"
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge: Sam Smith]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you
No, but I'm gonna pray

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
(Snoop Dogg)
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
5-7 clean, that's that big boy whip
Stacy Adams mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I'm mackin' a bitch, that's that big boy spit
King of the coast, yeah I earn't my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah I earn't that shoe
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Got them niggas on gin, gangstas back on them 

[?]
So, how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows and arenas, bitches thicker than Trina
Party like rockstars, at the bar is where I seen her
Made my move closely 

[?]
I had ya in the club for 10 years sippin'

[Chorus x2: Akon]
Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rockstar indeed
Ain't nobody better than me
Yes S N double O P

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Slow motion in the fast lane
Feelin' so alone blowin' zones in the crap game
Sittin' at the top of the game where you ain't
Got every type of car so now I just play to paint
Show after show, bank rows in the rolls
Livin' nice, big slice got me slammin' candy doors
3 piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop Corleone ridin' chrome like he gotta stop soon
Did it the G way, he say, she say
Peer pressure to me way to stop bangin' the C way
I was a hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed them
The people said I rapped like I was chillin'
Way above the stars Snoop Dogg is top villain
Classics and all it was was keepin' it true
I brought the west back what did you do?

[Chorus x2: Akon]
Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rockstar indeed
Ain't nobody better than me
Yes S N double O P

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Who did it like I done it (nobody)
You just in it, nigga I run it
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Like I can't get in your grill 'cause I live in the hills
Snoopy this, snoopy that, yeah I heard what you said
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I fed
Oh young ass buster, let me see ya I.D
I just chunked up a dub passin' V.I.P
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G
A N G S T A 

[?]
Been Crippin', been pimpin', been doin' the do

They play follow the leader
Boss on the move
Shark down to the shoes

[?]
Coldest of 'em all, I been keepin' it true
I brought the west back
What the fuck did you do, nigga?

[Chorus x2: Akon]
Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rockstar indeed
Ain't nobody better than me
Yes S N double O P
Wassup
It's me, Yup!
Um, I've had plenty episodes with various women
But it's just this one I must tell you about

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I met her in Victoria's, she was hotter than the crown Victoria
On my block, on a Friday, at 6 o'clock
Before I was on that Yung Joc, she made me lean and rock
I tried to tell her my name, but laughed more so
Because she looked like "Tell me something I don't know"
So I told her my number, and I got hers also
And of course she knew I had a girl, I wouldn't be in the store
So we hooked up that morning, like around 4
And at that time, I knew what she was down for (Yup!)
Soon as the door opened, war opened out
She was such a soldier, purple heart pokin out of
Her fatigues, but she's never fatigued
And with her, whatever I say, she believes
And my girl know, I got my magic show up my sleeve
But with her, I can disappear when I need

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And she say, she don't even care about my girlfriend
She say she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no
When this world is so cold, why should I be, (shit)
And he don't even wanna be my girlfriend, she just say she just wanna do her thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me

Let me tell you about this bitch I got though

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I met this bad bitch last month, bonified freak, we been kicken it for the last month
Or should I say, I've been hittin it for the past month
David Blane, magic stickin it for the past month
She got that coke bottle il shape, thicker than a Mcdonalds milkshake
We don't go on dates, we have field days
She let me play on her field, like a Bills game
She don't even like Football, she just sits home
But she love when I run it in her end zone
She love to role play, and put them wigs on
She be gettin her Lil Kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is
But with him, she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstands, how I wanna be

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, she don't even care about my girlfriend
She say she just wanna do the thang with me
And who am I to tell that girl no
This world is so cold, why should I be
She don't even wanna be my girlfriend, she just say she just wanna do my thang with me
And she gonna do her thang with me

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I think I heard something, the way your body sounds, it makes me want to do something
And your ? once around, got my speakers bumping
Your trebble's so hot, but I need to feel your base bumping
So turn the volume up, and shh
I think I heard something
The way your body sounds, it makes me want to do something
And you ? only once, so? it's got my speakers bumping
So go ahead, and let me know you ain't afraide of nothing
So turn the volume up and let your body talk
La la la la, la la la la
And make your body talk some more
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I can make her body talk to me
I can make that thing  jump off her, and walk to me
Baby girl, you're looking like a theam park to me
I mean, you're looking like stars in the dark to me
I feel like I'm on mars, and you're apart from me
Leonardo, making love is an art for me
New Carledo kinda small, but it works for me
Baby doll, I'm at your neck like a shirt button
What you tryna do, twirk something
I can make it feel good when it hurt, honey
Left you alone, the nerve of him
Shsh, I think I heard something

[Hook: Sample]
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne (Sample)]
I met her on the road on a Lil Wayne show
Looking like a ear just waiting to be told
And she looks a whole lot better and more
Looking a choice just waiting to be chose
I chose her and (It's been a week) but, um...
It feels like I know the girl so well
I don't know how but (It's been a week) and, um...
It's like we do whatever we shall like good pals
But um... (It's been a week) True!
But it's like I know her when I hold her, you know?
(It's been a week) But I, but I still told her how I told her
When I told her what I told her

[Hook: Sample (Lil Wayne)]
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Could it be love at first sight? First fuck, first fight
And it's only been a week but it feels like
A year, like, two months or something like that
I'm lost in the calendar but she know where I'm at
It's been a week man, but, um...
You dont know but I bet you know where she at
'Cause, it's been a week, but, um...
She's in that Carter with Nino in her back, yes
Damn, it's been a week, but, um...
It's like two trains that were on the same track, haha
It's been a week and, uh...
She changed her name to "I'ma call you right back"
Damn, and I say...

[Hook: Sample (Lil Wayne)]
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (Flip it)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I saw a girl at my show, in the front row
Standing there looking like she waiting to be told
I told her that and a whole lot more
And now she standing there looking like she waiting to be chose
And she say (It's been a week)
And I say, "Yeah," say no
(It's been a week) And I say, "Please, say no"
And I say, and she say, and we say

[Hook: Sample (Lil Wayne)]
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)
It's been a week, but, oh, it seems like a year (It's alright)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
You niggas know shit from sugar
You niggas know kisses from bullits
See me in the Bentley, with one rolled window
You know a boss, I'm a booker
My bitch get tossed like I through her
A bitch get lost if I took her
To the thrift show to where I live, like, look here
I got a mansion in the cave, like Batman
And your girl pussy poppin on the handstand
You wanna flex up behind it, you a bad man
Young Money, strong funny, age like bam bam
Black Lamb on the interstate, coppers givin chace, bet you I could get away
Spitta!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Yo, I'm sittin in the Chevy Shavell
With my favorite girl, she watchin Dave Chapell
While me, I'm on the selly, bout to blaze an L
Talkin to one of my homies, that's caged in jail
He tellin me bout this nigga that's raised in hell
Word done got back to him that I blazed his girl, now be callin like it's the end of the world
Now I gotta put in his world, close to daten, close to Satan
That's when you're gone when I see ya, I'm glad I'm me, cause, bitch, I wouldn't wwanna be ya
My niggas are like Freddikets, my life is the subject
Like Homer said, the greek homicides, I done it
What it is, ransom, parents, handsome
Make you feel it in your chest, like breast cancer
See Big said, niggas bleed just like us
But he never knew, niggas be cheese, just like us

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

[Verse 3: Boo]
Skinny nigga, fat pockets
Shoot you in the back, just to get your back poppin
What you know about fat profit
Cause I got that bitch, in my back poket
Went straight to the grove, skipped college
Yeah, you know, me and Mack, had them streets poppin
Stylin on you, I unload this volume on you
Young B, with 2 gloccs
Make a nigga see double off, one shot
Rocks in my chain, like Barney Rubble
This ain't an axadent, I was born to hustle

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cut like a blender, chopper like the feegy
They got so many pussy nigggas, they starting to police me
I don't give a fuck, if you be in the cut
With the choppers, so dap m up, eat m for lunch
Shootin out the window saying Young Money, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Echoes across the frozen lake
The stillness still much more than I can take
I hear the final hours chime
And wonder if this note will arrive in time

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop right where you begin
We might as well give in
'Cause we're tumblin' anyway
Whoa, start right where it should end
But start again like friends
Let our hearts refine the way

[Chorus]
May you, you and I
Never be undone
May you, you and I
Be a perfect one

[Verse 2]
Find that face within a crowd
And watch it slip away behind a cloud
Funny how a smile can stray
And end up half a universe away

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop right where you begin
We might as well give in
'Cause we're tumblin' anyway
Whoa, start right where it should end
But start again like friends
Let our hearts refine the way

[Chorus]
May you, you and I
Never be undone
May you, you and I
Be a perfect one

[Outro]
May you, you and I
Be a perfect one

[Sample from Susan Christie's "Paint a Lady"]:

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

[Sample from "Kamikaze" by MC Lyte]:
(I'm goin' kamikaze)
(Kamikaze)
(You ain't said nuttin' slick)

Maddie Acid leaving rappers flaccid
Gettin' illy with the nine-milly, landin' on my dashboard
Blastin' them out towards the future
Haters come at me 'cause I'm gettin' that ass like Kama Sutra
Pavin' a way to Hell's gate with a 12-gauge
I got on a ten-day wait from the sensei
So tell me if that makes sense
Because it's spilling enough blood to turn the motherfucking lake red

Fuck reputations
Work it, Joan Jett
These tone-deaf clones get blown to Stonehenge and back again
M80 on the track again
Packin' 210s, leave you empty like a juice cleanse
Making emcees, ephemera, et cetera
With wounds too huge for modern medicine
I bust slugs like a salt-shaker
And if you think you're in love, then I'm a motherfucking heart-breaker
Less talk, more gunplay
The broken clock unload the Glock
Like I was putting tokens in a slot
Bust the shots while I tell 'em "suck my cock"
Watch them rock gently in the tide by the fucking dock
I'm getting sloppy
Shooting at the sky
Killing all the angels, making baby Jesus cry
But why not? 'Cause when I grab the mic, it's white-hot
These laughing-gas rappers couldn't cut it like a bike lock
And have you ever seen a bitch so proud
To say shit so nasty I make myself blush
With the lust for life stick a knife to your guts
With no fuss but trust I bust rhymes like a cherry
Barely done before loadin' up another one
But all I got for haters is banana clips and bubble gum
Acid, watch it metastasize
Bullet through your heart call it "My Bloody Valentine"
Close your mouth and close your eyes
Say your prayers
Kiss me goodnight

Close your mouth and close your eyes
Say your prayers
Kiss me goodnight

He is just a child
He is just a child
He is just a child
He is just a child
He is just a child
Stay with him forever
He will never take care of himself

Take the bird and soak its wings
In gasoline
Light it up now
Let it fly high into the sky
It can never die
Take the bird and tell it lies
Give it your favorite shirt and let it fly
It can never die
It can never die

Take the bird and make it cry
Break its legs and let it fly high into the sky
It can never die
It can never die

[Verse 1]
Time's slippin' I've been slippin' up
Clock's tickin' and the spaces never feel like enough
Sweat's drippin' and I'm feelin' hot
Clothes are soakin' and I'm thinking when are they ever not

[Chorus]
Nice to see you on your own
I know it's getting hard to navigate this world alone
Try to open wide and see the world from each and
Every other side
You know

[Verse 2]
Gettin' lifted on the darker stuff
I'm different if I haven't had my regular cup
Lights flicker time to start the show
Gotta find a girlie 'cause the boys are surely rearin' to go

[Chorus]
Nice to see you on your own
I know it's getting hard to navigate this world alone
Try to open wide and see the world from each and
Every other side
You know

[Verse 3]
Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode, time to explode
Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode

Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode, time to explode
Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode

Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode, time to explode
Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode

Below, travelin' slow out on your own
Your mind, gelatin mode

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinning and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some thangs that I'm gon' do

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I hope you know I'm for the takin'
You know this cookie is for the baking (ugh)
Kitty, kitty, baby give that thing some rest
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm rockin' with ya
Diamonds ain't nothing when I'm shinin' with ya
Just keep it white and black as if I'm ya sista
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya
I know I get

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Ayy, I heard that pussy for the taking
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy
Yeah I treat you like a lady, lady
Fuck you 'til you're burned out, cremation
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang
Throw that ass back, bouquet
Call me and I can get it juicy
I can tell you're gone off the D'USSÉ
Careful mama watch what you say
You talking to me like ya new bae
Girl, talking like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her running like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, touche, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
You know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?
White girl wasted on brown liquor
I probably shouldn't be around you
'Cause you get wild, wild, wild
You looking like there's nothing that you won't do
Ayy, girl that's when I told you

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

These niggas snitchin' on the low, but I guess time will tell
But I ain't fuckin' with these niggas, I ain't got time for jail (no)
Ya' know that salt can kill a snail but it can't stop a player (no)
Is you gon' suck this dick or nah? Bitch, heads or tails (woo)
So many M's put away that I'm getting cocky as hell (ah)
Bitch, I can quit then leave the game, I'm like Dave Chapelle
I'm in a all black tux with a suede lapel
They'd never think I used to sling pots like Patti LaBelle
Watching two bitches eat each other while I'm pickin' my nails (woo)
I'm 'bout to pop a couple pills and do the Johnny Manziel (damn)
I'm Scott Storch on the keys, it's getting hard to fail (Scott)
But gotta pay the invoice, can't disregard the bills
Courtney Love with the dope, but got no love for real (no)
And it's so smokey in the club, I can hardly see (woo)

(Did this shit in one take, ayo)
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
(Ayo, that’s that fire shit, nigga, ayo)
Fuck these niggas man, man, man, man (Run it, run it)

[Verse 1]
Check my bankroll, ayo, 400K for vehicle
Paintjob look like ashy ankles on Django, interior look mango
Shotgun grape, he look like mayo
Golden voice on payroll, neck all gold like Kayo Corp
We aim at dorks, get out the way, yo
Keep them bucks in banks like Yayo
Swampy niggas out the bayou
Pockets flooded, y'all be dilute
Watered down, I'm Big Mac
I'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget
Fuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage
Financial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'
Grammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him

[Chorus]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends, where they go?
I stick to the plan, that's the goal
Fuck these niggas man, that's for sure

[Verse 2]

Look like a flag, what the fuck it do?
Golf be the set, no more OF
Like Ron Artest, bitch, we aim for your neck
Give a fuck about you or your respect
Yeah, that way, fuck your accolades
But I made the cut like I pack a blade
You could call me Brush, I've been makin' waves
Since Ashley Banks' cousin had a fade
But that's '92, I'm '91 (Hey!)
Watts Riot in my blood, nigga what's up
And that pussy pink like the drink in my cup
Lemonade, yeah it's Minute Maid
I been gettin' paid, pockets gainin' weight
Your bank statements on Mary Kate, but that's up to you, haha

[Chorus]
Man, now they go
(I ain't fuckin' with none of these niggas, man)

Fuck these (Ayo) niggas man, that's for sure (Ayo)

[Verse 3]
Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me
Skin glowin', clear of acne
Diamonds see-through, so holographic
Red Ones look like Aidan Mackey
Spent dinero like Taxi Driver (Skrrt!)
Handmade is that thing with tires
But I rode the bike and Vill tail behind me
And he got the Cannon like he bagged Mariah
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you’re a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark (Sike)
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause...

[Outro]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends

[Verse 1]
There's no such thing as the right time
So why do I keep telling you so?
I always look for the right lie
To keep you from letting me go

Little lips, cherry hips
I try to keep you in the past tonight
Bought a dress that I knew you'd like
But you didn't even give me a glance

[Chorus]
Now you're barely even watching me dance
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?

[Verse 2]
Live and learn, we all burn up, oh
But I'd walk through the coals with you
I felt like it would never end
When we were kissing in your sister's bed

[Chorus]
Fingers clawing at my neck
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?
Darling, are you feeling alone yet?

I was taught to do it real, real rational (Rational)
Six by six the Benz, yeah, the wagon
I'm tense, I might just fuck you with your bag on (Fuck you with your bag)
Got the Bentley coupe to match the wagon (Wagon)
Dawg said he gon' beat it, I told him, "Wag on" (Wag on)

[Verse 1]
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

[Refrain 1]
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

[Verse 2]
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

[Refrain 2]
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

[Verse 1]
Wasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself

[Chorus]
And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings

[Verse 2]
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' (winnin')
But you've been with me from the beginnin' (ooh, yeah, yeah)
And I know right now that we're not talkin' (not talkin')
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up (I'll beat it up, yeah)
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion (ride it baby)
This sex will get you high without no other substance

[Chorus]
So who do you belong to now? (Who do you belong to now?)
Who you give that love to now? (Who you give that love to now?)
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now? (Who you gettin' sprung for now?)
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot (I got a lot)
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot (blowin' up their spot)
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway

[Bridge]

If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e
On me, me, on me, oh, I
On me, on me, on me

[Verse 1]
And now I know relationship's my enemy
So stay away from me
I'm warning you
You try to fill the void with every man you meet
'Cause you're upset with me
I'm warning you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you

[Verse 2]
When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me
Just call me up again
I'll make you weak
Girl, I'll come to put myself between your legs
Not between your heart
Can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
That all the nights you slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)
If it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)

[Verse 1]
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

[Pre-Chorus]
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently (Ohh)
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (Say call out my name, baby)
Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way
And, I'll be on my—

[Outro]
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)

[Verse]
Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, let's just try to end it with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering

[Chorus]
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

[Bridge]
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

[Outro]
I don't wanna hear that no more, no more
No more, no more
I don't wanna hear that no more

[Intro]
Any time is the time
Any time for you to get my call, baby (so, baby)
Are you alone, baby?
If he ain't around, pick up your phone, baby
Whoa

Baby girl, remind me (-mind me), -mind me (-mind me)
Let me know if it's on
And you know where to find me, find me
Havin' thoughts you never had, yeah

[Verse]
I didn't know you were down for him finding out
I thought you had some kind of love for your man
Well, I'm not tryna break up something
You've been workin' out, you've been steady
But I'm ready to go all the way if you let me
Don't you tempt me
You're lookin' grown since the last time I looked at you
It might have been, been about a couple months
But I just got the picture that you texted to me
You ain't steady, you look ready to go all the way
If you let me take you down on me

[Chorus]
Can you try me? (try me), try me (ooh)
Once you put your pride aside (once you put your pride aside)

It won't matter, it won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter

[Bridge]
Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (in my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it

With no shame and with confidence you're by my side
I proclaim it not in confidence, your truth and I
Can't stay quiet 'bout it
No, you know I tried, and I
I can't hold my piece, I see the world
Through Zion's eyes, sing Kim

Kids with babies and the chosen ones are dying slow
And oh, without you Lord I don't know where the world would go
All the brokeness is weighing down, hey, round we go
And I'm now hoping this is taking long
But here we are Lord

I'm walking the way (walking the way)
I'm feeling the truth
You're the life I believe
I believe in you (oh yes I do)
You're my hope every day
We're dependent on you (and you know you)
What a price, what a name
With no shame and complete confidence
Your word is true
I've decided to commit my life and follow you
All the doctors tell us news and things we all go through
All i know is what your word told me and I will do

When I can't listen to broken-hearted people crying
I submit to you
Give you my soul to multiply it
All of the valleys, desert, storms and trials
I been through (preach)
I have learned that through it all, all that we have is you

Oh, oh you made the sun to shine (you made the sun shine)
Day to day
Living in your body, your mind
All the health and strength
It's God's power, to salvation
God's power (you Lord)
In difficult times, look to Him
Look again
More love than you ever will know

Yeah with no shame, complete confidence I know you're here
With instruction know destruction has no power here
And I can't ignore all of the signs I see on public news
All the headlines say the earth is done but
I know You...
Made the moon to shine in the night
Amidst the darkness you still shine bright
There is salvation for come every problem
That's why you mention, throw every weight
There's so much power and love in the name
Every hour your name feels right
You have salvation, throw your tears
You have so much patience and loyalty
Make that sun to make shine, through all my needs
You the power and glory yeah
Yeah through the fire, sinking sand
God hold my hand

[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Drop: Grandtheft]

[Verse: Rihanna]
We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
I say "your place" when we leave

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves

Wo-o-o you picked me up
And showed me true love
Still could be found

You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin
I'd be lost without you

Come and tell me again
You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through

[Verse]
I was posted on the block with a big ass joint
Police everywhere so we stay on point
Money in my hand, pockets stay on swole
And if you ever ask a question nigga we don't know
Don't be talking to me crazy if you ain't 'bout drama
And don't even be hittin' my phone if it ain't about commas
Imma ride every day for my gang with no problems
And if a nigga want beef, we filet 'em and chop 'em
I get high every day, you can say I'm a doctor
Got my niggas out the streets, you can say I'm a prophet
I got money in the bank, it can't fit in no wallet
I got niggas in the pen, but that ain't on the topic
Roll the weed in the paper you would think it was college
Got my mind on my money, I'm just focused and honest
If a nigga talk crazy then we leavin' him tarnished
Yeah my crib in the hills but I came from the bottom
I ain't worried about the mills cause I already got 'em
Everytime I'm in the bank trying make a deposit
If I'm hoppin' on the plane, know I'm gon' make a profit
Got the keys to the game if I wanna unlock it
I'll be smokin' KK til' you think I'm unconscious
I'm a real ass nigga know my style ain't polished
You's a fake ass nigga know you can't come 'round us
Was round good weed back when our parents could ground us
Now I'm doin' real shit that they say that they proud of
Fucked up situations trying get my guys out of
If you see a nigga with me best believe that they 'bout it
Taylor Gang or they die best believe that they shout it
I pour up a lot of drink come to weed need a mountain
Keep the money comin' in run to me like a fountain
Lot of fuck niggas hate, I can see 'em they doubt it
Don't approach the situation they just reaching around it
I ain't scared of confrontation me I'm speaking about it
I got so much fuckin' money that I need an accountant
I'm so big you don't see me, you just reading about it
If you coming at the Gang then you need to reroute it
Wanna know how I maintain well the secrets they solid
Niggas wanna know the formula cause we done found it
Make another 100 mill, I ain't gone be cool about it
Made my way up out my city yeah it can be kinda violent

[Outro]
Cause when you gettin' money niggas try to slide on you
And when it's said and done them hoes switch sides on you
But I got 4 dime pieces at the crib waiting for me
2 cell phones cause the money keep comin'
O's in my bank, ain't no one fucking with me
Smokin' KK like everyday 420

[Verse: Joba]
It's too damn easy, to hide away, or run away
For me they're both the same, I just need a reason
Before I choose to stay before I choose to say "I love you"
These three simple words, have caused me so much hurt
Ooh, la, la, ooh, la, la
I feel it, I'm feeling, those feelings, I feel them
Ooh
Was told the beauty's in the details
But I'm not the type to say how I might feel
Started in high school, got my diploma
Then dropped out of college, always been a hard-head
Lacking in knowledge
But goddamn, man, when will this end?
I need new friends
And maybe it's okay to fall in love again

[Spoken Word: Bernie Mac, Charlie Rose]
"If I dedicate myself to one thing, I need to focus on that
If I dedicate myself to something else, I need to focus on that
To try and do all these, and do the road, do stand up, and do a television show and then try to deal with our marriage and our home? Something's gonna give. Something's gonna give and I don't want to do that."
"And what's the most precious to you beyond family?"
"My comedy."
"Comedy. Not the sitcom, not the stand-up, just comedy?"
"My comedy."
"Being able to create truth..."
"Right."
"And enjoy, and entertain"

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]

But when I close my eyes I think about you every time
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

I've been lookin' for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one, step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

[Verse 2]
I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride

Shut up and drive (drive, drive, drive)

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Under my umbrella
Yeah

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Ne-Yo]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile?
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Ne-Yo)]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo & Rihanna]
You completely know the power that you have (power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Rihanna)]
And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you girl (yeah)
But I just can't let you go (oooh)
But I hate that I love you so

[Bridge: Rihanna & Ne-Yo / Both]
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me (hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo / Both]
That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ohhh)
And I hate that I love you so so

[Verse 1]
Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing

[Verse 2]
Take off my cool
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers, whether win or lose, is...

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing

[Bridge]
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing

[Intro]
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down

[Verse 1]
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

[Chorus]
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me

[Verse 2]
I know many guys just like you, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I can be the girl that'll break you down

[Pre-Chorus]
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

[Chorus]
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me

[Bridge]
I wanna see how you move it
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess
Baby, there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me (The way you stare at me)
Come up to my room you sexy little thing (Sexy little thing)
And let's play a game (yeah), I won't be a tease (no baby)
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing (oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would light me up (Light me up)
And say you want me
Push up on me (And say you want me)
I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would push up on me (Oh oh)
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me (Light me up)

[Verse 1]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Verse 2]
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Outro]
We done forever

[Intro]
You should tell me what's bugging you
And I'ma tell ya 'bout me
Make a wish and tell me your deepest thoughts
And I'ma make it easy

[Verse]
Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but won't tell me
It's about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I could tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it (say it)
Tell me what it is you like (like)
Baby baby don't be shy (shy)
Maybe you can spend the night (night)
If you say it
But if you playing (not with it)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)
I need to know how you feel
So baby why won't you (say it)
Say it (say it)

[Bridge]
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest

[Chorus]
So maybe if you say it
So maybe if you say it (say it)
Baby baby don't be shy (shy)

So baby why won't you (say it)
Say it (say it)

[Verse 1]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

[Chorus]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

[Verse 2]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

[Bridge]

No (Don't say), I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down, no way

Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh, I'm not playing

To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice

[Verse 3: Treach]
Now who’s deceivin’ ya to believe in a
Monotonous fever mainstream mumble the media made up
Keeping a shadow on people, the slaves of the day
Deceived and believed that we’re equal to rights
Peep and getting even
And even when breathing, we can’t inhale freedom
Save the playa haters for later, it’s demons I’m weaving
We’re needing a scheme, it’s making me feel like screaming

[Pre-Chorus: Michael, Janet, Both]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream

As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit

Hee…ahh…hoo hoo

[Janet Jackson]
Peek in the shadow

And I won't give up the fight

[Lyrics from Leak]

[Sample]
Every time we wrote a song, it was a hit
That was unbelievable
That first beat is right on time
Right on top, like they say

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
I don't fuck with no bitch that ain't been hustling
I grew up way quicker than momma knew back then

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I threw up all that liquor, I was supposed to hold it (Hold it)
When I go out to party, I get paranoia (Lonely)
I'ma island out in public, you supposed to hold me (Hold me)
Fuck 'em when I'm at the store 'cause Shelah put me on, bruh
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have a lawyer
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have cable
Damn, I miss the days when I didn't have paper
When the nigga I was bugging wasn't hitting me for favor

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Fifty off the top, the double C was on your backside
Switchin' out positions in the car don't want no tickets
Sneaking undercover, hopping fences in your backyard
I was on the floor, sunbathing just like a reptile
I wish I could scoop you out the pool
Remember the first time I pulled a move?
Well damn, I guess I'm off it cut the check for me not office
My brother been bossin' up like steroids was in his coffee
We all be going through it, with crazy ex-lovers
That make me block my number
But damn you know I gotcha, alright

[Interlude]
What was wrong with the world?
(everybody's talking about the good 'ol days)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I'm all out
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though

[Verse 3: JOBA]
I suppose the 90210 is where people go when they sell their souls
But you know what? It ain't all bad
But just like dough
The more you make, then the more you throw
You threw it all though, you gave it all up
Damn
You used to wanna run for office
Now you just wanna be poppin' so bad
Yachts and mansions, All That like Kenan Thompson
I know your momma
And I know your momma don't approve of the pussy poppin'
She spent her whole life scraping change to put you through college so you had options
Used to love to dance and sing but you've been fucking actors
Blowin' smoke and stealin' keys
Postin' pics in Bentleys
Blowin' coke and eating free
And you ain't shit on TMZ but you're a star to me

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
I can't fuck with no nigga who ain't got no function
I can't trust them no more
I can't fuck with no nigga who ain't got no function
I can't trust you niggas no more
No more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though
Hey y'all, hey y'all
I really wanna see ya, I want love
I got it on my way now to your house
To show you how it's safe now
Cuz you got love for me though

[Lyrics from Snippet]

The weight on my shoulders
I just can't get over
He won't take me back
But he still got my heart
The weight on my shoulders
I just can't get over
He won't take me back
And they don't know how hard it is

[Verse 1]
Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who’s going to save a little warmth for me

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train

[Verse 2]
If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who’s going to say a little grace for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train

[Chorus]
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me

[Verse 3]
See the sun go down, it’s going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light but who’s going to save a little light for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train

[Chorus]
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me

[Outro]
If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who’s going to say a little grace for me?

[Verse 1]
Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who’s going to save a little warmth for me

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers

[Verse 2]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Intro: Sly Pyper]
Oh my God
If you’re good long enough you’ll know it won’t need to rain
With just one sunrise
My life, bumps & bruises
Battle scars had to prove my loyalty for my hood
These are better days
Voices from vices got me standing me here
Singing praises to Your name
For saving me from my yesterday
Second chances come with every sunrise

[Chorus]
I wake up feeling like the Most High's favorite child
Cuz he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Painted blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise

[Verse 1: Sly Pyper]
My life bumps and bruises
Tribulations and trials, but I made it through
So it’s all good
These are better days
I just want you to know
I’ve been to the bottom of the barrel of my pride
And I fell down by surprise
Why live in the dark when there's sunrise?

[Chorus]
I wake up feeling like the Most High's favorite child
Cuz he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Painted blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Shout it out to the world
IG posted it
If you get a second chance, you better make the most of it
I used to ride with the gun guys
Blaze to the fun times
But nowadays, I just praise until the sunrise
Been down so long
I’m used to falling, y’all
But I recognize, this my calling dawg
I been ordained, anointed with the oil
On the battlefield
Loyal to the soil
I'm lookin’ at the man in the mirror
See now things is gettin’ much clearer
I got my own church, my own choir, my own band
I guess you could say, I’m a brand new man
See rap guys usually don't get baptized
But how could you cleanse your sins without it
Make you wanna think about it, uh
Right reverend the reverend right recite light
You see today is the day to get your life right

[Chorus]
I wake up feeling like the Most High's favorite child
Cuz he gave me you
A breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
Painted blue
I wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
Another day was proof that
Second chances come with every sunrise

So forget about your day and let this record float you away
As your mind is winding, finding cause to be easy
And now you’ve got your space and the room filled up with haze
As you travel on I’ll watch you pass me by, but right now you got to keep rollin
Tire Eyes
And keep rockin
Tire Eyes

There ain’t no shame in claiming time, no need to explain it
The sour powder is here to set you free
Just sit back and smile let it last for awhile
Let your mind caress your thoughts that rest inside
And roll them tire eyes

Tire eyes
Keep rolling tire eyes, baby keep rocking those tire eyes
Turn away, away from the day
Look towards the sun, you’ve already won
Lorelei, you don’t have to hide
There’s more to see, it’s your fantasy

Running through life so aimlessly
Closing your eyes to everything inside
I can’t believe how much you’ve changed
Something tells me nothing is the same

Guess she’s got a heart made of metal
Oh, oh-oh no
Tell she’s got a heart made of metal
Lorelei’s got nothing to hide, don’t know why

Guess she’s got a heart made of metal
Oh, oh-oh no
Tell she’s got a heart made of metal
Lorelei’s got nothing to hide

Don’t know why,  Lorelei
Lorelei, Don’t know
Nothing that we’ve been through, babe
Has ever been enough
You just pack me up and send me off
Like I have lost my touch
Looking back, I’ve been so foolish
How could I not tell?
I can see you soaring high up in the sky
While I’m stuck in hell
Lorelei you won’t escape my thoughts so presently
It’s a cold…

Lorelei’s been on my mind today
I don’t know what to do, what to say
Money can't buy a nicer thing for you
A castle max-capacity of two
Distance- it messes with the space
But I swear, it's all there
Victory lap
Get on my level
Cracking heads
Yours too if you're not careful
Danger zone
I said what I needed and I'm not sorry
All alone
Got just what you needed and I'm not sorry

Victory lap
I deserve a fucking gold medal
Back for more
He's a case he's a hot kettle
Danger zone
Not sure but I'm not sorry
All alone
Feels good and I'm back for more
I close my eyes and travel somewhere far away
You’re still the one thing on my mind

I’m falling through a new dimension every day
You’re still the one thing on my mind

I reimagine you in each and every way
I guess I’ll find my peace in time

It doesn’t matter really what you had to say
You’re still the one thing on my mind

Oh, it’s coming up on me slowly
Really fighting it off tonight
Oh, it came so swift but surely
You’re just always on my mind

I close my eyes and try to make it go away
You’re still the one thing on my mind
Get yourself on a level
Check your vital signs
Is your head screwed on man?
It’s alright, it's okay
It's just fine I don’t wanna do it

Drop yourself down a digit
Reflexes won’t hide
Mark my words man
‘Cause it’s true, it’s all new
It’s so rare, it’s right there I don’t wanna do it

Bite your tongue, stop the bleedin’
Swallow those sweet words
Too late babe ‘cause it’s coming on
There’s no way, there’s no chance
I won’t bend find another puppet

Let him be the way he is instead of putting him on a pedal
Images escape to him, he’s not here, he’s not there
It’s alright, I don’t care, I don’t wanna be the…

[Intro/Monologue]
When people come at me a certain type of way, uh, I forget them for
They base their opinions merely on what they were taught
You know, what they were given, what their parents taught them
You hear that? When you see this ain't, that- that's not nothing
They will never be anything and you know, I'm a pretty good dartboard 'cause I can take it
I'm a easy target, 'cause I don't fit in
I think through the gate, you know
From The College Dropout when I was the only person with a polo in the midst of a whole bunch of jerseys
That I was the, the difference
And I realized that I'm not just fighting a battle just for myself, but for a generation
You know, a generation fighting against the false information of the media
And the perceptions that people create in the matrix that society creates in the lies that people tell, and the-
And the laughs and the jokes that people tell all the way back in a high school lunch room
All the way to when you know, you're older, and anyone that decides to walk their own path as ostracize
And um, you know, you have to be stronger in that situation and that's- that's one of my main goals that they don't kill me can only can only make me stronger

[Verse 1]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Is this what you've been waiting for?!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
Uh, baby, you're makin' it

[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
Is this what you've been waiting for?!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–
(I need you right now!)

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Verse 1]
I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over, over

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Bridge]
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

[Verse 2]
So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Verse 3]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, put the work
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love

[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over, over

[Chorus: Rihanna]
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs

[Bridge: Rihanna & will.i.am]
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

[Break: Rihanna]
All I've got

[Drop: Chew Fu]

[Rihanna]
Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

[Refrain: Rihanna]
All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

[Bridge: Rihanna & will.i.am]
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you

[Outro: Rihanna / Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographs

[Verse 1]
Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

[Breakdown]
And you can see my heart
Said I’m terrified

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Won't you come and sign me out?

[Verse 1]
Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

[Chorus]
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

[Verse 2]
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

[Bridge]
Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

[Chorus]
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from

[Intro]
Stupid in love
Stupid in love

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size 10 in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
Stupid in love
Stupid in love

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is "You Idiot"
That's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one."
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist, on repeatedly trying, to tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

No, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid

[Verse 1]
It's not the energy reeling
Nor the lines in your face
Nor the clouds on the ceiling
Nor the clouds in space
It's not the phone on the table
Nor the bed in the earth
Nor the bed in the stable
Nor your stable words
It's not the formless being
Nor the cry in the air
Nor the boy I'm seeing
With her long black hair
It's not the open weaving
Nor the furnace glow
Nor the blood of you bleeding
As you try to let go

[Chorus]
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

[Verse 2]
Not the meat of your thigh
Nor your spine tattoo
Nor your shimmery eye
Nor the wet of the dew
It's not the warm illusion
Nor the crack in the plate
Nor the breath of confusion
Nor the starkness of slate

[Chorus]
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

[Verse 3]
Not what you really wanted
Nor the mess in your purse
Nor the bed that is haunted
With the blanket of thirst
It's not the hunger revealing
Nor the ricochet in the cave
Nor the hand that is healing
Nor the nameless grave

[Chorus]
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat
Not to die
Not dying
Not to laugh
Not lying
Not the vacant wilderness vying
Not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Keep staying in my soul
I keep fighting, fighting it
Mama said you must be strong
Healing slow, feeling so low
I can't eat, I can't grow
I can't heal my soul

God, it's been so long
There must be some kind of light to come
Unless I go home, lost in oblivion
There must be some kind of light to come

Let myself find out there's more
Let my heart find out there's more

If there's more
If there's more

Keep saying write my songs
I keep crying, crying
Love has taken all of my energy
And it's brought up all my melancholy
I just found I can't breathe
Like they say, like a song
I just found I can't breathe
Like they say, going somewhere
Come and go
Desert horse
Burning sun
Dunes of sand

Far away from her mother
So far away from her brother

Burning sand (motherfucker!)
Dunes of sand (fuck you!)

Does it matter
Now you’re gone
You can pretend
And fill the void
I left and time
Will heal my soul, my soul

So much blood
On my hands
And there’s not much left to destroy
I know I am better alone
There is so much blood
On my hands
And not much left to destroy
I know I am better alone
(Swedish scream: I have cried also)
(Breathing in)

Mon amour, je saigne toujours
Mes sentiments meurent
Et la nuit, j’en rêve aussi

Je voudrais mourir
Mais viens le jour
Je rêve toujours
Et la lune répond

So much blood
On my hands
And not much left to destroy
I know I was better alone
So much blood on my hands
And not much left to destroy
I know I am better alone

Mon amour, je t’aime toujours
Mais sentiments meurent
Et la nuit, je t’aime aussi
(Elle s’enfuie et l’apaise, le vent du nord)
(Elle se noie, dans les sables mouvants)

[Melody Prochet]
Quand les larmes d’un ange font danser la neige
Douce neige blanche
I found somewhere to hide
(somewhere to hide, somewhere to hide)
Someone to be held by
A safe place to cry

To these angels aching
Keep smiling
Ain’t no karma, only love
To punish those with rotten heart

Angels
Keep smiling
Ain’t no karma, only love
To punish those with rotten heart

You know it’ll always get that hard
Then your mind will get blind
Don’t think of it like that
Just feel it with your heart

Find someone nice
Find somewhere to hide
(somewhere to hide)
Someone to be held by

[spoken: Nick Allbrook]
The memory of making love
And they moan and 

[?] all loud
But it comes through the window like a whistle or a whisper under the bed and little children think that the monster—
Crazy
...just wanna shit all over myself when I die
Be declared braindead or heart-dead in the Vatican

[Melody Prochet]
Angels, aching
Keep smiling
Ain’t no karma, only love
To punish those with rotten heart
Angels, aching
Keep smiling
Ain’t no karma, only love
To punish those with rotten heart

Angels, aching
Keep smiling
Ain’t no karma, only love

[Verse 1]
Barefoot front porch swingin', here all alone
Tracin' my steps tryna figure out what went wrong
You were here one minute then the next you leave
Now I'm stuck here tryna breathe
Note that says “It ain't you, it's me"

[Chorus]
But it ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holdin' memories
It ain't you, it's me

[Verse 2]
I found some stuff I just couldn't throw away
Some old T-shirts and pics of us in a frame
I talk to the walls like they feel my pain
'Cause the echo of you is here to stay
I'm just stuck tryna find what it means
It ain't you it's me

[Chorus]
It ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holdin' memories
It ain't you, it's me

[Chorus]
It ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
No, it ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holdin' memories
It ain't you, it's me
Mm

[Verse]
Smile on my face but I’m dim
Head heavy like Tim
Eyes point down at my chin
Don’t know how to fix it
Had the Nissan with the rims
Thought I was hotter than that nigga, Mims
When papa’s fries used to fill me up
You the one that I used to love

It’s past 12 am
I’m on my second wind
I keep that white light on me
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck if I die
I like chilling, she like choking, that’s the difference
When I can’t put my finger on it
I put it in it

[Chorus]
There's something different about you
There's something different about you
There's something different about you
There's something different about you

[Verse 1]
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singin' my favorite song
Swingin' on the front porch, just laughin' at the dogs
How you swear you love me more when you're whispering, "Goodnight"
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well, it says "Kane Brown" on a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name, this is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' 'bout you, baby, all I'm thinkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Bridge]
Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Outro]
I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with ya
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be
Tell me your story, I'm all ears to listen
Don't spare no details, go on, get specific
I know we just met but I already miss you, honestly

[Chorus]
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only, woo

[Verse 2]
I wanna be your Fridays, baby
And Tuesdays too
24/7 loving up on you
Introduce me to your friends
Wanna shake your daddy's hand
Be your all the time kinda man

[Chorus]
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only, woo

[Bridge]
I'm feelin' your vibe, you got my attention
When you walked in here with nobody with ya
Girl if there ain't a guy in the picture, I wanna be

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna love you just for one night only
This ain't just a take you home thing
Pick you up and buy you one more, whatever you're drinkin'
That ain't my style, ain't what I'm thinkin'
Thinkin' every morning with you baby, coffee pourin'
Talkin' bring you breakfast in bed
A kiss on your head, again and again
Girl I don't wanna love you just for one night only, oh
Yeah, one night only
I don't wanna love you just for one night only
Yeah, one night only

[Intro]
You know what I'm saying?
Still that nigga man, Yeah the lord's back
Know what I'm saying, they say pearls are for a pretty boy
Shout outs my nigga G Herbo
My nigga Lil Uzi Vert one time
Shout out Three Six Mafia

[Verse]
I don't play like your parents' son
Thought I made that apparent
That's a hundred for a 'Claren or something
'nother hundred for a parison
Race Tyler, the McLaren
Drive 'Raris like Ferris, huh
Cop my Karats from Carring dammit
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag

[Chorus]
Who run it? Who run it?
New money blue hundreds
Two hundred, on the dash
Bastard life, who run it?
Catch a blue hundred
I do run it, I do run it
I do run it, I do run it

[Verse 1]
See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fighting again

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Let's go

[Verse 2]
I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

[Verse 3]
Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smoking, oh

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinking or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Leggo

[Outro]
Thug love, thug love, thug love

[Verse 1]
Once he dressed in silks and lace
And owned a Rolls Royce car
Now he seems quite out of place
Like a fallen star

Race around my kitchen sink
Happy as can be
I'll just have to stop and think
Why he fell for me

[Chorus]
I'm not much to look at
Nothing to see
Just glad I'm living
And lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can't save a dollar
Ain't worth a cent
He'd never hollar
He'd live in a tent
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

[Verse 2]
Though he'd love to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away

[Chorus]
But why should I leave him?
Why should I go?
He'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

[Verse 3]
I can see no other way
And no better plan
Than to end it all and let him go
To some other man

When I hurt his feelings once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Verse 1]
All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

[Pre-Chorus]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Bridge]
The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Funny, you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, I want you to stay
I want you to stay, I want you to stay

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
Got my head spinnin', no kiddin', I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

[Intro]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse]
Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Tonight, she yelling, "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Verse 2]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass

[Bridge]
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses, yeah

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Gang!
They talkin' down on my name, don't let 'em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang, A$AP boys came with the flame
Gang! Gang! They talkin' down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name but this ain't no regular name
Gang! Gang! They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game!

[Verse]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
Cause smokin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

[Pre-Chorus]
I put A$AP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game! (Game, game, game, game)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky + Khloe Anna]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

[Outro: Khloe Anna + Moby]
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
I never meant to lie

[Verse 1]
Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
And didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

[Verse 2]
What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just tryna orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

[Verse 3]
I still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

[Outro]
Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once

[Verse 1]
Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (Stop)
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland
Say, "Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (Stop)

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

[Verse 3]
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 1]
So when you gaze at planet Earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on Parliament Brawl
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on videocall

[Verse 2]
Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of "You don't know what you're doing"

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many Lolas

[Bridge]
And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports
Hoo

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas

[Verse 1]
Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 2]
This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

[Chorus]
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Bridge]
And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 1]
Last night when my psyche's
Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Verse 2]
The leader of the free world
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got him sen a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Bridge]
In the daytime
Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise
I'm sure you've heard about enough

[Chorus]
So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Verse 1]
Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

[Bridge]
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

[Outro]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five

[Verse 1]
You push the button and we'll do the rest
The exotic sound of data storage
Nothing like it, first thing in the morning
You push the button and we'll do the rest
Bastard Latin, that's the best thing for it
You push the button and we'll do the rest

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby

[Chorus]
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

[Verse 2]
Pattern language, in the mood for love
You push the button and we'll do the rest

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You and Genie wearing Stetson hats
Trying to gain access to my lily pad

[Chorus]
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

[Bridge]
The world's first ever monster truck front flip
I'm just a bad girl trying to be good
I've got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

[Verse 3]
Forward-thinking model villages
More brain shrinking moving images
You push the button and we'll do the rest

[Verse 1]
Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
And it's on its way back here to scoop you up
But not on my watch

[Chorus]
I want to stay with you, my love
The way some science fiction does

[Verse 2]
Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing
I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages

[Chorus]
The way some science fiction does
The way some science fiction does

[Bridge]
Got the world on a wire
In my little mirror, mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat

[Outro]
So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I've a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good
The way some science fiction does

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like)

[Verse 1]
Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable NYE

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Good morning
(She looks like fun) Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun) Snowboarding
(She looks like)

[Verse 2]
Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Bukowski
(She looks like fun) Dogsitting
(She looks like fun) Screwballing
(She looks like)

[Verse 3]
Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

[Bridge]
No one's on the streets
We moved it all online as of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Key changes
(She looks like fun) Re-thinking
(She looks like fun) New order
(She looks like fun)

[Verse 1]
I want an interesting synonym
To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

[Verse 2]
It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

[Chorus 1]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get ahold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

[Verse 3]
You go in through the door
Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

[Chorus 2]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul
Looking at the ladies for some possibilities
I wanna plant a great big family tree
Some guys can be picky, but that's just not me
I wanna plant a great big family tree

Sittin' at the swim club and strechin' my quads
Everybody wants to be a part of my squad
Sittin' at the swim club and strechin' my quads
Everybody wants to be a part of my squad (my squad)

The gay guys say I'm sexy, but I don't really care
I just want to get them out of my hair
The gay guys say I'm sexy, but I don't really care
I just walk away as they stop and stare

Looking at the ladies for some possibilities
I wanna plant a great big family tree
Some guys can be picky, but that's just not me
I wanna plant a great big family tree

[Intro]
"You no-business, born-insecure, junkyard motherfucker!"

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Campfire—I'm a hot motherfucker
Please, no pictures, I'm a tired motherfucker
Spidey senses tingle when it's fake niggas
Dreads swinging like they did the Harlem shake, nigga, that's true
West Coast 'til I d-i-e
If you want respect, look me in my e-y-e
I love my whips like a racist and travel lot of places
Free my nigga, Hef, fuck the police
Uh, Oprah for President, CLBN resident
Thizz-Face when I'm disgraced—that's the nigga in me
Might catch me at a Whole Foods
And if you see that red Mercedes, then you know who

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 2: Ritchie with a T]
Yeah, yeah, campfire—I'm a scary lil' nigga
This run in my blood like Drew Barrymore, nigga
And my fit on ET, yo 'shit on EBT
So when you try to flex, I'm like, "What's yo' credit score, nigga?"
Yeah, and that's word to my granny
Since 14, knew the route like Randy
Everything dandy, gray sweats with the Pennys
Nausea, heartburn, side effects may vary
Yeah, fuck these niggas, where the child lock?
So many hits, I could have my own NOW! comp
Pen a triple album full of all my children
No difference from Kidz Bop, book 'em in the Hilton

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 1]
Drinking from the steaming street
Filling up my lungs with heat
Breathe out all that anger
Try to find some inner peace

[Verse 2]
Shadows trying to run me down
Telling me it ain’t my town
Be that it as it may
I’m cashing in my favor now

[Pre-Chorus]
Hid it in the basement
Gotta keep it safe somehow

[Chorus]
But it’s really quite a shame that it’s gone to waste
I was hoping to bring some home
As I slowly roller-skate through a wall of hate
I was hoping to save my soul, but what’s it for?

[Verse 3]
Tumbling down that hill again
Bodied by the rushing wind
Then I reach the end yet
Wonder why the light’s so dim

[Verse 4]
Listen to your roommates hum
Down the hall as I woke up
Chair legs on the hardwood
Think I’ll pour myself a cup

[Pre-Chorus]
Sister for the weekend
Love you still when Monday comes

[Chorus]
But it’s really quite a shame that it’s gone to waste
I was starting to feel so whole
Feel like every single day's such a piece of cake
I was trying to bring some home
As I slowly roller-skate through a wall of hate
I was hoping to save my soul, but what’s it for?

[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
I want to stay
But I need to go
I want to be the best for you
But I just don’t know what to do
'Cause baby, yes I've cried for you
The time we have spent together
Riding through this English weather
And as the pressure builds
So does the tension between you and me
Time has gone so fast
Watching the leaves fall from our tree

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
Baby, I just want you to know
I still love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you

[Verse 2: Poppy Ajudha]
And the grass is always greener
On the other side
Maybe you should come and take a trip sometime
Oh you seem keener
When they turn to night
But you trippin  out your mind
Baby, tell me it's a sign
As the pressure builds
So does the tension between you and me
Time has gone so fast
Watching the leaves fall from our tree

[Chorus: Poppy Ajudha]
Baby, I just want you to know
I still love you
Love you
Love you
Love you

[Intro]
I don't care what you done, I don't care where you been
All you got do to is look over your shoulder
And look where God has walked you from
All you gotta do is look back
Just somebody look over your shoulder
Look where you come from, look where you come through
I come through the storms and rain
Look where I come from, I was down but now I'm up
Look where I come from, by the grace of God
By the goodness of God, look where I come from
Remind me where I'm from again (6ix)
Yeah, that's right, that's right
Tryna suppress the stress, you know?
Got a family tree that needs watering
A father that needs fathering
A mom that would probably prefer the whole mother-daughter thing, but we still rolling, you know?

[Verse 1]
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
They callin' my name, just another day
Can't bend, can't break
Can't let it show on my face
All of my mistakes, right there on display
All part of my story, skin thick as my shawty, yeah (Too thick shawty)
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
Is everybody safe? Carrying the weight
Tell me what it takes to get everybody straight
The money in my safe, can't buy a clean slate
Clean isn't for me anyway

[Interlude]
I don't want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
Alright, alright, go ahead and tell 'em, go ahead and tell 'em
Because I want you to know, God told me to tell you this day "You are useful" (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
You are valuable (Yes), and you are vital (Yes), to God

[Chorus]
Vital, vital, on baby, on Bible
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I spoke
Please don't stand at my grave and cry though
I'm not there, they made it so I can never really die though
So please don't stand at my grave and cry though
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And don't let nobody call me an idol
'Cause I was never sitting idle
And my people go where I go

[Verse 2]
Don't let nobody sell my house on the bridle
Worked too hard for the title
Worked too hard, where did life go?
Last thing I heard was Andre scream "Ice cold"
Past eight years feel like I had my eyes closed, blindfolded
Smoke before I make my decisions
That's how I take the high road
Say I never get alone time, that's a lie though
I'm still alone with everybody as far as I know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

[Outro: Nai Palm]
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (Highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you

[Intro]
Swedish House Mafia
Tunechi!

[VERSE 1]
Okay
Death is in the alley, life is in my pocket
I break it down and sell it, does that make me a profit?
There's too much weight to carry
Ye, I walk through the valley
Damn, when it rains, it storms like Halle

Man, I don't know the future
But I know where I'm going
Don't know when I'll get there
But I know that I get there
God bless America, I hope he hears my prayers
There's a stairway to heaven, but people under the stairs

Love is in the air, pollution everywhere
Love is such a fucking illusion, its never there
So in my spare time, I don't have time to spare
So I put on a condom and happily fuck, yeah
Fu-fu-fuck Yeah

[Verse 2]
Alright, alright
Colorful reality, everything is beautiful
Simply refuse to get used to the usual
Life tastes sweet and even sweeter with the freedom
But be careful with belief, cause you are what you believe in

Now it's me against the world, and I just want to get even
In the belly of the beast and somebody gotta feed it
We get a train of thought, and then that train leave us
And we can't have tricks up our sleeves if we are sleeveless
That's because we bear arms, watch my rebels swarm
Dreadlocks only to hide my devil horns
Life is but a bitch, she'll go fuck you and leave you
If you think its sweet, I knock out your fucking sweet tooth
Tunechi

[Outro]
Y-M-C-M-B
Ya

[Chorus]
Lead me to love right now
With everything you do
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me you care right now
And show me that you do

[Verse 1]
This whole world's got me down
Not a friend could be found
Why don't you take me, take me!
Take me, take me by the hand!
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Why don't you lead me
Lead me to love right now
With everything you do
And why can't you see girl
I need a little love right now
And show me that you do

[Verse 2]
I wanna hear you say
Yeah, baby
I'm going to stick by your side, alright
Yeah, you know
You know my love will be your guide
You know I'm gonna stick by 

[?]
Searching for another please
Why don't you touch me, touch me!
Touch me in this heart of mine!
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Why don't you lead me
Lead me to love right now
With everything you do
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me somebody love me
Somebody love me

[Verse 3]
That someone is you
And I wanna hear you say
Yeah, yeah, oh baby
Oh, tell me that you love me
Stick by my side
Oh, I say that forever and ever
You'll always lead my life

[Chorus: Kanye West & Quavo]
Why all bad b– keep they phone face-down?
Bad girls always keep they phone face-down
I love you when you face-down (ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo
Face-down the only time you come around (yeah, face-down)
Face-down the only time you come around (yeah, face-down)
Young nigga came from that Bobby Brown (Whitney)

All my money came out that mud or ground (yeah)
They can't be real (no), her act can't be real (no)
But I like how I feel (I do), I like how I feel (I love it)
I gave her a deal (ayy), I gave her a pill (ayy)
Now she worth a mil' (yeah), now she worth a mil' (million)
Ice all on me (ayy), these racks all on me (yeah)
You can walk all on me (uh), you can skate all on me (yeah)
Niggas ain't homies (woah), but you can wait on it (grah)
You can wait on it (woah), I bet I'ma eat my opponent (argh)
I'ma need some manners (ayy), I'ma need some more cameras (flash)
I'm too hot to handle (ah), blow money like candles (phew)
Riding on camels (yeah), in Dubai riding camels (oh)
Wanna buy me a camel (oh), but I want and bought panorama (ay)
Yeah-yeah, higher than fighter jets (high)
Face-down now she soaking wet (face-down)
Yeah, I really wanna ride with her (ride)
But the pussy got mileage (mileage)
Yeah, I'm dabbing and styling (styling)
I wanna hold her up for hostage (hostage)
But she end up outsmarting me 'cause she did four years in college (damn)
Ayy, ayy, yeah, she did four years in college (damn)
Yeah-yeah, I'ma gon' give her this molly (damn)
Yeah, I was gonna give her this molly (damn)
Yeah-yeah, have her face-down on a island (yeah)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Quavo]
Why all bad b– keep they phone face-down?
Bad girls always keep they phone face-down
I love you when you face-down (ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I'll never trip over you (no), it's more fish in the sea (yeah)
Soon, I promise you'll see
Yeah, you the one who need me (uh-huh)
I can't convince you if you ain't gon' listen
I ain't going on no damn-damn mission (oh)
Flipped your phone, you had phone calls missing
Who the fuck is this nigga named Tristan?
These bitches are so stupid
All your life, have you been a groupie?
No morals, there's no sorrow
You must like peasants, you coulda been with the Pharaoh

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Oh, oh-no, oh-no, oh

[Intro]
Get down tonight
Get down tonight
Get down tonight (What up? What up? What up?)
Get down tonight (Outsidaz)
Get down tonight (Outsidaz)
Get down tonight (Rah Digga, Young Zee)
Get down tonight (Bus' it, bus' it)

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I hate white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
No, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
‘Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um... one, two...)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a bitch herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my EP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 2]
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
‘Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin' "I suck!"
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud: "All y'all get the hell out now!"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
"But Eminem, this is your record release party!"
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Ohh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be!"
I told 'em, "Meet me at the Rockfest concert" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye!)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Hook]
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)
Come on everybody (Get down tonight)

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight no more
Sick and tired of slammin' doors
I keep tryna leave, but you make me stay
'Cause it's all my name, make me feel safe, yeah, yeah,yeah
I don't wanna cry no more
Tears are pouring down like it's a thunderstorm
I keep tryna leave, but you always say
That it's all my fault and I'm to blame
I really hate it when you say that

[Chorus]
My heart is beating in my chest, we'll never be friends, ah
My heart is hanging by a thread, we've come to the end, ah
My heart, my heart, my heart is turnin' numb, ah, yeah, ah
My heart, my heart, my heart is dead and gone, ah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Used to be a dream come true
Went to Paris, nearly got the same tattoo
Wore each other's clothes, held each other's hands
'Cause it didn't turn how we planned, ah-ah-ah
But now it's all lies, on thin ice
The nights are 'round and they hurt, don't think twice
Wore each other's clothes, held each other's hands
Don't pretend that you don't understand
I really hate it when you say that

[Chorus]
My heart is beating in my chest, we'll never be friends, ah
My heart is hanging by a thread, we've come to the end, ah
My heart, my heart, my heart is turnin' numb, ah, yeah, ah
My heart, my heart, my heart is dead and gone, ah, yeah

[Bridge]
We'll never be friends, we'll never be friends
We'll never be friends, no
We'll never be friends, we'll never be friends
We'll never be friends, no
We'll never be friends, we'll never be friends
We'll never be friends, no
You really hate it when I say that

[Chorus]
My heart is beating in my chest, we'll never be friends, ah
My heart is hanging by a thread, we've come to the end, ah
My heart, my heart, my heart is turnin' numb, ah, yeah, ah
My heart, my heart, my heart is dead and gone, ah, yeah
A tender love we once shared
A joyous love we once cared
Now our love is just a shattered dream
So far away from me you're driftin'it seem
So hard to try hide
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You love more
You once said your love for goes beyond compare
The esctasy we once felt in our hearts we no longer share
And each kiss seem to say farewell my dear
There's nothing left of this love is oh so clear
So hard to try hide
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You love me no more
You just don't love me no more, awww
You don't love me no more
Owwwww baby
I can tell that someone else has taken my place
Though you keep the truth from showing on your face
You think you have me fooled but you don't realize
I can see the truth when I look into your eyes
I can see it your eye
I can see it your eye
I can see it your eye
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more - owwww
IIIIIIIIIII-
I can see it, see it, see it
You don't love me no more
I, I oh I i can see it, see it, see it
You don't love me no more

[Verse 1]
There were tear stains on your face when I met you
Put there by some guy who left you
He took you breathlessly by the hand
And a, led you to a faraway lonely land
Oh, that's where he left you
And so much you loved him
You would have given him anything
And although you're still clinging
Forever dreaming, I'll wipe your tears away
And if you let me I'll stand strong

[Chorus]
All because I love you
Honey it's all (All because I love you)

[Verse 2]
And if he comes back I know you have to go
But I don't mind if it means that much to you
I just believe that he's no good for you
So I'm gonna stay by your side and comfort you
I'll never leave, no matter what they say
If I'm a fool for you, I choose to be that way
Without you I'm nothing, without you I'm suffering
As each day goes by me, I'm hoping you soon try me

[Chorus]
And it's all (All because I love you)
Honey it's all (All because I love you)
Baby won't you help me baby, baby (All because I love you)

[Outro]
Woo! I believe
Yeaah, I believe someday you're gonna love (Uh-huh)
Someday you're gonna put your arms around me (Uh-huh)
It's gonna be alright (Be alright)
I know it's got to be alright (Be alright)
So what if there's danger, as long as I'm able
I'll put my life on the line, I'll chance it a thousand times
And it's all (All because I love you)
Said it's all (All because I love you)
I gotta believe baby
It's all because I love you (All because I love you)

[Verse 1]
Hey, girl
Come wander in the cool breeze
And hey world
Give it up with this deep freeze

Cause I know that you
Wanna swing your hips
In the solar eclipse
And watch this new day (rise)

[Verse 2]
Hey, girl
Move right across the country
And hey, girl
Don't listen to your mommy

'Cause I know that you
Wanna show the rest
That you're movin' out west, and
Hey, girl
I'm really gonna miss ya

[Verse 1]
As I was walkin' down the road to Bethlehem one night
I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl

[Chorus]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

[Chorus]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah....

[Bridge]
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone

[Chorus]
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah
This is the long love we follow
There in your ancient times
I can see all no tomorrow
There in your ancient past

Many are the nights I lie awake
I listen to each breath you take
And when your world is cold
And you've got no place to go, look for me

Many are the moment were apart
Im half myself, Ive got no heart
When my world is cold
And Ive got no place to go, look for me

Dreams can die be-fore their born
Truth is on the wind
And while we've got each others souls
We've got everything

Lovers and friends
Taken from high above
I become yours tonight
Tell me its me you love
Lovers and friends
Bound by each others souls
And I'm bound to hold you in my hand
And I'll make you understand, and I'll never let you go

Many are the nights I fly alone
I dream of you, I dream of home
And it all gets sold away
And you don't hear a thing I say, come to me

Here is life and then its gone
It's just that way for everyone
The sun will set on our love everyday

Lovers and friends
We've only just begun
As tall as the mountain high
As long as the river runs

Lovers and friends
Bound by each others souls
And I'm bound to hold you in my hand
And I'll make you understand

And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never let you go
(Heavenly angels hard to find
They are of the special kind
Someone playing on your mind
Love is never far behind)
Lovers and friends
Bound by each others souls
And Im bound to hold you in my hand
And I'll make you understand

And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never let you go
(Heavenly angels hard to find
They are of the special kind
Someone playing on your mind
Love is never far behind)

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)

[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
It was over in a day
All the things I used to say
You kept to say
All the places we would go
All the songs we got to know
You held it all

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris

[Verse 2: GoldLink]
Young young, all in love in a lost place
God damn, got me runnin' 'round in a rat's race
Say grace, but I fell in love with a small waist
Uh, never start, yeah right, yeah uh
Bang, uh, shot me in my heart and it hurt gage
She so fly like a dove, that's a dove face
Thunder what she get now, but this ain't her birthplace​
Tom, don't tell her, but it's Paris for her birthday

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris

But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)

[Outro: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
But you're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)

[Verse 1]
Mmm, when I had your love I was a king
Yeah, you were my diamond, and you were my pearl
And I bragged to the guys about my wonderful girl

[Chorus]
And now you’re gone and all my riches turned to rags
Gone and I don’t have no cause to brag
But when I had your love I was a king, oh yes I was

[Verse 2]
When I had your love I used to smile
And the smile I wore was a definite sign
That love was mine, and I was feeling fine

[Chorus]
Now you’re gone and now my smile has turned around
Gone and now my smile is just a frown
When I had your love I used to smile, mmm-hmm

[Bridge]
Honey, baby
Dark nights keep on falling
My lonely heart keeps calling
Baby, come on back (Come right on back)
Baby, come on back (Come right on back)

[Chorus]
Hey, when I, hey, woo-hoo

[Verse 3]
When I had your love I was content
My life was sweeter than peaches and cream
It was so wonderful, just like a dream

[Chorus]
Since you’re gone, I haven’t had another sweet day
Gone and all my dreams have faded away
Oh, when I had your love I was content, oh yeah

[Outro]
Baby, I need you
Right now, mmm-hmm
More (More)

Hey hey (More)

How many roads must a man walk down 'fore they call him a man?
And how many seas must a white dove sail 'fore she sleeps in the sand?
And how many times must those cannonballs fly before they're forever banned?
Oh yeah, let me tell you that the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer's blowing in the wind, oh yeah

(Well, how many years?) How many years must a mountain exist
(Yeah before) Before it's washed to the sea? Yeah
(And I wanna know how many years...) Now, how many years can a man exist
(Ah, before) Before he's allowed to be free? Yeah
(Too many years have gone by already now, Stevie)
Now how many times can a man turn his head
(He turn his head and pretend) And he pretends that he just doesn't see? Whoa, yeah
You know the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind, uh-huh

Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free, mmm...

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care

Oh, someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
When all men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time
Not having you
Is then only thing
That I wish I didn't have to do

[?]

Even though its not forever
Even though its not forever
Even though its not forever

I want to see you every day
Every night
Every day
Every night
Every day
Every night
Every day
Every night
Every day
Every night
Won’t you come over now?
Won’t you come on over now?
Won’t you come on over now?
Won’t you come over tonight?

Every day
Every night
And our lives would be just fine
Every day
And every night
And our lives would be just fine
Every day
And every night
And our lives would be just fine
Every day
Every night
And our lives would be just fine
Every day
Every night
And our lives would be just fine

Every day and every night
Every day and every night
Every day and every night

[Spoken]
This is Marvin Gaye in Waterloo, Belgium! And we just got finished dubbing in "Sexual Healing" and, I could use a bit of that
Oh, seriously, I would like to tell you how much I miss you. I've been away for three years. I'm anxious to come home in a bit. I'd like to wish you all the best this year, good health, the best in love and all the happiness I can throw your way at this point. Have a good convention, love each other. Peace be with you, I sure do hope you like this music. God bless you all. Love you very much, bye-bye
I'm in love with your sweet tone
'Cause it brought me happiness all night long
And now I see
My baby coming back for more
'Cause the way we did it
We got the satisfaction
And that's for sure

She surely knows the way
To make me free
Walkin' that walk
And just talkin' that talk to me

Honey, she said she wanted me
Another woman at a party
Just like this

So let me tell you 'bout last Saturday night, the club was rocking
Super freaks hanging out wall to wall
They tell me something's going on in the men's room
Soon as we come out we'll be high soon
Did you save a line for the ladies?
We're not into that are you crazy
Who's the super freak in the red dress?
When she starts to shake it, I can't take it
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Shake it baby, shake ya titties
We got the party, we got the sounds
We're in the streets and all the freaks are getting down
Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat
Shake, shake your thing

[Bridge]
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You like to rock, you like to rock
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You turn me on, the way you dance, the way you dance
Midnight lady, sexy dancer
Hot and hardy, love to party
Check it out

[Verse 2]
We're jamming to love
Major love, minor love
Jamming to a great crescendo
Let's party baby, shake it, baby, shake it
Party night to remember
Oh, everybody's having fun
Come on and party turn the green light on

[Verse 3]
When I saw you, I had to stop
I had to stop in the middle of a bop
I had to stop, I got the rhythm
I got the rhythm in my soul, open your heart
Love is everywhere for the making
Freaks is everywhere for the taking
Blues is in the air if you sing it
Happiness come back if you bring it
I'm having me a good time

[Bridge]
Midnight lady, midnight lady
Rocking and finger popping, baby
Somebody said you was a super freak
I'm here to tell you I'm a super freak, baby
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
Somebody said you was a super freak
I'm here to tell you I'm a super freak, baby
Freak, oh!

[We got to rock, we got the rhythm
We got to come on down to the boogie]
Feeling good

[Outro]
Check that classy rhythm
Give me that sexy beat
I dig that feeling, jam! Oh, jam! Oh
Midnight lady, sexy
You are the one I'm looking for
I never, never, never knew before
Oh, baby, you're looking so good
Super freaky
You turn me on

[Intro]
Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight, oooh

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual Healing baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

[Verse 2]
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
'Cause you do it right

[Bridge]
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby ohhh

[Verse 3]
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
The way you heal me
The way you thrill me
Keep me coming to you
For you to sexually fulfill me
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
(Heal me my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

[Verse 4]
Baby
When I should be 'sleep at night
I stay up and read
And baby, baby, baby
I can't help but feel uptight
For my passion needs

[Chorus]
And when I get this feeling
I want sexual healing
When I get this feeling
I want sexual healing
Baby, I can't stand it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
And when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
Oh, when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling
'Cause I'm all alone
I need sexual healing, darling
'Till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate

God has healed my heart
How'd I let you make me so ill?
I know I loved you too much
I guess I always will

You got to know that I love you so
You've got to feel
That my love was strong for you
You've got to feel
When a man's love is real
Baby, if you never will
I thank God for my music

[I got my music]
Oh, my soul
Now if my kiss is sweet
Let it turn you on
Still got my music, girl
And if my love for you
Is really done me harm
I've got my music

All you left me darling, with
Was the music in my ears
Always when I think about you
I just listen to my music

Dreams of you, darling
Are still so fine
They got my wondering, dreams of you
If you still could be mine

Sweet music's been my therapy
Washing the hurt and pain from my anatomy
Now folks who try to put me down
Will never hurt me because I've got my melody

You know that the world ain't right
You know that people are uptight

I got a song in my heart
And I'm willing to sing it apart, oh baby

[But that ain't all of the story that we're singing, baby]
Happiness today is just a song away, oh God

Give me the music
If you're worried 'bout tomorrow
Turn on some music
And peace of mind will come
Don't'cha, baby?

Sugar pie, sugar pie
'Cause I miss you, baby
When I make you mine

[Verse 1]
Tell me do you think about me
When I'm lying on your heart
Tell me do you dream about me when you sleep out underneath the stars
'Cause I don't want a hollow smile
I want all that's on your face
And I don't only want to love you I want something that I can't replace

[Chorus]
Yeah I want to know what's real
What's been purified to heal
My wounds
Tell me is it you?

[Verse 2]
Saw you on the street one summer evening
You were empty as could be
You were lying in the road just waiting for the cars to set you free
You asked me if we could run away
Someplace nobody would know
But I don't wanna be your fool if you're not the one who's gonna take me home

[Chorus]
Yeah I want to know what's real
What I'm so damn scared to feel
Yeah I want to know what's real
What's been purified to heal
My wounds
Tell me is it you?
Tell me is it you?
Tell me is it you?
Tell me is it you?
Your eyes shining with the stars
Laying out in your backyard
I won't ever sleep tonight I swear

'Cause that's when you come to me
As I'm drifting into dreams
I can barely close my eyes I swear

It's always the same thing

You've been hanging in my brain
Causing all my stomach aches
I can only think of you these days

It's always the same thing

You've been spending all your time
Living on the backside of my eyes
Sleeping pills won't clear my mind no way
I've been spending all my time
Looking at the backside of my eyes
You're the one I always find there babe
It's always the same thing

Fill my head with pillow talk
I've been feeling low too long
I need to hear your voice a while my love

I just miss the way you taste
When you're hardly still awake
Lying next to me, I'll let you have my love

It's always the same thing

You've been spending all your time
Living on the backside of my eyes
Sleeping pills won't clear my mind no way
I've been spending all my time
Looking at the backside of my eyes
You're the one I always find there babe

It's always the same thing
It's always the same thing
It's always the same thing

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go I'm hearing something
Baby, stop making things out of nothing
Am I the one to blame? three years, still the same
I talk still nothing is changed
I had to go, you called me rude
I did it for us, I did it for you
A hundred below, high on the roof
Was tryna get close, you tell me to move, oh, ah
Tell me, do you wanna stop?
Before I get up to the top
Click clack pow, just take your shot
I won't wait, I've had enough, yeah
2 AM, my mind's on us
All my friends out to the club
Saw you there, they said you're numb
Numb to the pain, oh how you changed

Blowin' the clouds, tonight it will rain
You havin' fun, this isn't a game, oh yeah

I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big three, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet

Big Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, that's Barbie tingz
Uh, Barbie dreamhouse, Barbie rings

All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's Ken
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in

[Verse 1]
Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (By the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

[Chorus]

You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong

[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I gotta learn how to love without you
I gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in a riddle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Drop]
Without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I gotta learn how to love without you
I gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in a riddle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you

Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarrassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest?

Used to work hard, just to get half back

Vintage Hermès by Jean Paul Gaultier
Lagerfeld customize my gold chair

Uh, look at my knockoffs, I told 'em knock it off
Anything that Nicki do, you know they knock it off
Put my crown on again, and I'ma knock it off
Anything with Nicki in it, they gon' pocket off
I mean profit off, my plug drop it off
You see them copyin' my hair, tell 'em, "Chop it off"
Uh, bad gyal whip, the top is off
You nuh see him downgrade when mi drop 'em off

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too, too
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes (yeah)
Playas get lonely too, too (ohh, ohhh)

[Verse 1]
From my iPhone to my sidekick
Jet planes, schedule hectic
My love life, I neglect it
Had a fast car but I wrecked it
Plenty chances to fall in love, man
So many weekends I went to clubs, man
In the fast lane, my life's a picture flick
Let my drink decide who is the next chick
I ain't gon' lie, all the playing it don't matter to me
She say she me love me but it's just chit chatter to me
But deep inside I was always missing something
But I'm a thug so I'm always on something
So many girls always drinking and having fun
Life's a beauty shop and I keep my hair done
Seems like I'm on a merry-go-round
Man, that make a thug wanna settle down

[Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too (oh I do), too (oh I do)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes (sometimes)
Playas get lonely too (oh I do), too (and you know I do)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna settle down with you (oh oh), baby you and me (ay hey)
A life that's brand new (oh oh), quit running these streets (ay hey)
Take away your pain (ah ouuu), chase away the rain (ah ouuu)
Up my love game (ah ouuu), I might even change my name (ah ouuu)

[Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too (oh I do), too (oh I do)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes (sometimes)
Playas get lonely too (oh I do), too (and you know I do)

[Verse 3]
Uh, uh, V.I.P., uh, uh, R-O-B
Always in the spotlight
Living the good life
All of that, something still just ain't right
Videos and all of these interviews
When all I really want is to be next to you
I'll spend more time with my car now
Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now
My life is more than the cars and awards
It gets lonely and I can't ignore
Always in the streets going hardcore
I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored

[Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes (sometimes), sometimes (sometimes, I)
Playas get lonely too, (oh I do) too (oh I do, yeah)
Sometimes, sometimes (sometimes), sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
Playas get lonely too (oh I do), too (and you know I do)

[Bridge]
(Party nights mixed with lonely nights
Mixed with first class flights mixed with)
Uh, nobody to share it with, no
(Above all after parties, I still need somebody)
To be there when a playa's going through some shit
To be there when a playa can't make a hit

[Chorus]
Sometimes, sometimes (sometimes), sometimes (sometimes, ooh)
Playas get lonely too, too (I know, I know I do)
Sometimes, sometimes (sometimes), sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
Playas get lonely too, too
(Rolling in my drop, living on top, and it don't stop, no)
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
Playas get lonely too, too
(Every now and then, I need somebody)
Sometimes, sometimes, (sometimes) sometimes (sometimes)
Playas get lonely too (oh I do), too (I do)

[Outro]
Playas get lonely
R-O-B, yeah, 12 Play: 4th Quarter
Playas get lonely too

[Intro]
Ooh, this is a true story, yeah
This is a true story, yeah
This is a true story
This is a true story

[Verse 1]
A couple of days ago, I got a phone call
Saying "Are you Mr. Kelly?", and I said, "Who's this?"
Then he said, "It's Tameka's lawyer, and am calling on her behalf"
Then he said, "I've got some news
That I think you would wanna know"
And then he said, "She's pregnant" (*gasps*)
And then I sat down real slow, then said, "Who's this again?"
He took a breath and said, "You heard me the first time."
And then I said, "Wait a minute, mister
We talking 'bout the same girl and she's a stripper
You representing that girl, man she's a freak
And how does she know that the baby belongs to me"
Then, he asked me did I meet her two months ago? I said yeah
And then he asked was it at a club in Chicago? I said yeah
He said, "Well get ready to raise it
'Cause she says you're the only one she laid with", ohh

[Chorus]
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Oh I know I hit it)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(I should've used to protection, yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
('Bout to get my money, yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Man, I don't even like this girl)

[Verse 2]
I hung up and called my lawyers, and I told them the situation
And the first question out they mouth, was did I sleep with the girl
At first I hesitated this, then said yeah
And then went on to tell 'em I hit it raw
And then they said, "Well it might be a chance
That you may have to pay the cost", I said, "Good Lord"
And then I put the phone down and just thought about for a couple of seconds
They asked me had I seen her recently? I said nah
Then asked do you sleep with her frequently? I said nah
All I know is that I left the club with this lady
And now here I am this baby's maybe, ohhh

[Chorus]
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(See I admit I hit it, yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Man, I knew I should've used some protection, yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(She 'bout to get my money, yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Oh man, and I don't even like this girl)

[Bridge]
Man I can slap myself for getting involved with this lady (with this lady)
If I can turn the hands back, I would have went on home to my baby (somebody)
Now I'm all caught up yeah (caught up), all from a measly late night creep (hey)
One year later (hey), I get a picture
And I'll be damn this baby look just like me

[Chorus]
There's a very good chance that it might be mine (and it might be mine, yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine (then it might be mine)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine (hey, said I'm almost sure about it, hey)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Good chance, good chance, good chance)
(Listen, if it look like me, look like me
Walk like me, walk like me, talk like me, talk like me)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Baby, go figure, ooouuu yeah)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Well, I guess I'm gonna have to take the test)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine
(Said I'm on my way to take the test)
There's a very good chance that it might be mine

[Verse 1: Tom Misch & Carmody]
I watched you move away
Little dead i felt that day
You were all in my mind
I'm not trying to be unkind

[Verse 2: Carmody]
You disappeared at the shore line
Before the touch of your hand wrapped in mine, wrapped in mine

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
I scatter every piece of you
I cross gray waters than you
I felt your ghost leaving me
I couldn't hold to your memory, memory

[Verse 3: Tom Misch]
Tenderly smile and wave goodbye
As a small tear falls from your eyes
This love that was coming from me became harder to see

[Verse 4:  Carmody]
As I let go all of all of you
It was lost to the days out the blue

[Chorus 2: Tom Misch & Carmody]
I scatter every piece of you (If you leave me, how you leave me?)
I cross gray waters than you (If you leave me, how you leave me?)
I felt your ghost leaving me (If you leave me, how you leave me? If you leave me, how you leave me?)
I couldn't hold to your memory, memory (If you leave me, how you leave me? If you leave me, if you leave)

Sunny days, good weather
You and me, forever and ever
Those were your favorite lines
But I found out you were cheating and lying

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be no looking back
'Cause this time I'm on the right track
I done made up my mind
Leaving you behind

[Chorus]
Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!

Now let me tell you somethin'

[Verse 2: Damon Harris]
Girl, your love is just like the weather — changing all the time
My leaving you might not mean a thing, it's true
At least I'll have peace of mind

'Cause this time I'm on the right track
'Cause I done made up my mind

One thing you can be sure of, between me and you there ain't no love
And that's a natural fact (Yeah)

There'll be no looking back
'Cause this time I'm on the right track
'Cause I done made up my mind

Smooth sailing, from now on...right on!

Feather in your cap if you catch a robber
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through
Pay close attention to my story
And you’ll find every word is true

Junk man standing on the corner
Selling death, no conscience has he
In the name of God, won’t somebody stop him
(Stop him, stop him, think about the children)
It’s a matter of life and death, can’t you see

Ain’t no time to stand back and point your finger
(Ain’t no time to point your finger)
We’ve got to face reality (Reality)
No, no, no, no, no...
Don’t turn your back on this problem, people
(No, no, no, people)
Too much depends on you and me

Desperate with no sense of values
Just an evil mind lurking through the night
Because of you, the streets ain’t safe no more for walking
(No more for walking because of you)
'Cause you’re feeling so uptight
Take a look around — are you afraid?
Take a look around — don’ t be afraid
Take a look around — are you afraid?
Take a look around — don’ t be afraid
Take a look around — are you afraid?
Take a look around — don’ t be afraid

Baby, you a dime, I put diamonds from your neck to your toe-a
Baby, you worry too much

Fuckin' thots, that's not enough
Sleepin' in the whip, no house
No guap, baby girl, huh, that's that real love
Baby, you was riding when things was tough
Baby, you a whole diamond in the rough
You know you're forever mine

But that's just for the neck, girl, no lie
Never had real love, I'm bad at trusting
I just fuck, then I move on, no cuffing
You held it down back when I was out hustling
Tryna turn nothing to something
I know you're special
And I hope you make it big one day
Let these niggas try you, I'm the first with the gunplay
'Member when your moms brought my dog on a Sunday
I've been trippin' lately, need to get out the sunken place
And you super fly, you could walk on a runway
You still mine although I know you hate me
I should have gave you the world, but I fucked up
Late nights on 14th Street givin' butt rubs
I tell myself in my mind that I need that
I see you and I'm scared what you see back
You come around when you want, I don't need that
I've had so much heartbreak that I bleed black

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love...

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dark night on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, your mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the  time

'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)

Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?

'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Delicate

[Verse 1: Jazze Pha]
Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
Came in the door like whoa
Pull up
Can't even see no more (no more, no more)
Somebody pull the wool up
Surround myself with loved ones
Later for them haters
And now I'm going up y'all
On a escalator

[Isaac Carree]
Y'all may think I'm acting brand new
Y'all need to hold up
I'm just tryna give you something new
I'm a different fella
Y'all keep holding me to what I used to do
Stop being judgmental
Had to make space between us
Stepping out the middle

[Chorus]
I've changed
Was different when you found me
Changed everything around me
Now you're looking at a different me
Changed
Down for so long
Down for so long
But now I'm way up, way up

I've changed
Was different when you found me (so different)
Changed everything around me (yeah, yeah)
Now you're looking at a different me
I'm not the same (I,I,I)
Down for so long
Down for so long
But now I'm way up, way up

[Verse 2: Isaac]
Tried to do it my way
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
Excuses every Sunday
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
Turning up every weekend
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
Hanging with the wrong friends
(That ain't work, that ain't work)
(Jazze Phizzle)

[Jazze]
Get on up out ya feelings
Come get down with the realest
I hear a train a'comin'
And you don't even need a ticket

[Both]
You can't accuse me of nothin
Some people say that I did it
I've been acquitted
Put your hands up if you feel me
I represent it
Y'all know my praise is relentless

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Isaac]
Coulda sworn that I was having the time of my life
I was turning up
I was turning up (Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!)
Had to turn it all around
Turn my wrongs into rights
Had to give it up
Had to give it up

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jazze Pha]

Ladies and gentlemen

Black Elvis
Phenzel

Hey! Got the praise going up!
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby

Wake up in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You get me caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions
Caught in the middle of my own emotions

Wake up in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
And your stars away from me
Oh Let me take you from the middle of your dreams
To my mystery baby
You sleep so deep in the middle of the night
Oooooooh
Oooooooh

Oooooooh

[Verse 1]
You are, like a gentle breeze
And the thought of You takes me
Back down memory lane
Lord, I remember what You did for me
You sacrificed for me
You gave Your life for me

[Chorus]
It's really unbelievable that You love me so much
It's really incredible how I'm healed by Your touch
In spite of my flaws
You answer my calls
It's really unbelievable that Ya...
You're so incredible

[Verse 2]
You kept me alive (yes You did)
In spite of my sin
Brought me so very far
From where I started
Even before I was born
You made me to win
Lord, I think it's incredible
Jesus, You are incredible

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Ohhh)
Unbelievable (yeah)
Phenomenal (yeah)
Inconceivable (yeah)
Indescribable (yeah)
Incredible (yeah)

Remarkable (yeah)
You're Magnificent (yeah)
Glorious (yeah)
Incredible (yeah)
That's what You are to me (that's what You are to me)
Ooooh yeah

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
Lord, You are (You are)
Everything (You're my everything)
If it wasn't for Your love
Where would I be? (I would be nothing)
My life would be nothing
So incomplete (If it wasn't)
If it wasn't for Your love

[Snoop Dogg]
A lotta times
You see performing for thousands of people
Filling their hearts with love and joy
Not knowing that I'm going through so much pain
But God knows...everything!
And I mean everything that I'm going through

[Chorus: B.Slade]
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain

[Verse 1]
Feeling so alone...and deserted
People standing all around you
You walk around (hey)
With a fake smile on your face
Cuz you don't nobody to know what you're going through (nooo)
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the....morning
But you weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming (ohhhh)

[Chorus]
Pain
Pain
God knows about your pain (Ohhhh)
Pain
Pain
God knows all about your pain

[Verse 2]
Feeling so alone...and deserted
People stand all around you
Walk around
Head up with foolish pride
Cuz you don't want nobody to know what you're going through (ohhhh)
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy is coming in the....morning
But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy comes in the morning!

Comes in the morning
Morning
(Oh yeah)
It comes in the morning

[?]

Clouds in the sky, hurrying by
I know it's alright, Jesus is mine
Joy comes in the, joy comes in the
Joy comes in the morning time
Joy!
Joy!
Joy comes in the

Joy comes in the morning
Break it down one more time for me

But your weeping may endure for a night
But your joy...comes in the morning

[Verse 1]
A change for the better
I'm reading Your letter
There's love on the pages
There's love for the ages
Right, wrong, same song
Your grace still sufficient
No shame, we admit it
Your way's a higher way

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, send a new wave
Do a new thing
Don't wait
Please move...in new ways
Do new things, yes
We wait on you

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow you
And I think of all the days my hope was through
And still you came and brought me through

[Verse 2]
Brought me through from shame, temptation
Hopelessness, no motivation
Accusers in the waves throwing dirt on my name (yeah)
What's my name without Your love?
(What's my name without You?)
Will not make it without Your love
(I won't make it)

[Pre-Chorus]
God, send a new wave
Do a new thing (yeah)
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things
So we wait...on You (yes!)

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

[Bridge]
I can't be without Your love
I can't be without You
I can't do it, no
Won't you help me say it
I can't be without Your love
I can't be without Ya
I can't, I can't alone

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things You brought me through
The world, it needs to follow You
I think of all those days my hope was through
But still You came and brought me through

So, send a new wave
Do a new thing
Don't wait
Please move
In new ways
Do new things, yes
We wait on You!

Please move
Please move
Please do things
I know You can
I know

[Rap verse]
Came back for Him, the body was gone
All that was left was the stone
The Sword it was on
Two feet, on two wings
Blood and meat from the bone
A risen kingdom, but no mobile phones
Just faithful messengers
Everyday is being used in mysterious ways
And everything is a cost with some pain
Some lonely days, Jehovah knows
High on the throne, Christ to the right
This pen can't write the sights of my home
In spite of miracles, doubt abounds
Octo-, with tentacles
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

[*slows down*]
I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown

I can't make it without the faith to know
It's only Christ that rights the fights of unknown
Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh
On time

Don't you worry, don't you fret
Has there ever been a time when God has failed you yet?
Don't you worry, don't you cry
Just keep your head facing toward the sky
When I was sinking, He lifted me
When I get lonely, He comforts me
He's always there when I need Him the most
Filled my soul with the Holy Ghost

Jesus steps right in on time, ON TIME!
(Jesus always steps right in on time)
Jesus steps right in on time, ON TIME!

When I'm lonely, He comforts me
He's always there when I need Him the most
Filled my soul with the Holy Ghost

[Verse 1]
I said I woke up early this morning
I'm nowhere near where I need to be
But look at me, I'm feeling free this morning
Get out my bed, move my head, stand on my feet
I'm thankin' Jesus this morning, yeah
I know I don't talk to Ya much
When times get rough
I'm on my knees and I'm callin' You
Cause I know that You will always bring me through
And I know the plan, yes
Sometimes I take advantage
But at times I try to do
Things on my own
And I make a big mess
But I know God got my back
Even when self don't know how to act, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm not letting one minute, moment, second pass
Without saying, "Thank You, Lord"
Thank You, Lord
For Your many blessings
Gave me everything I need and more
Even when I don't deserve it
You still watch over my family
And keep 'em safe from all harm and danger
A better man is what I'm tryna be
So I praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Thank Ya, thank Ya, thank Ya
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em

[Verse 2]
I know this is something I shoulda been doing
No excuses, I know the Word, I was raised the right way
I was off track doing no good
But thank the Lord I got a second chance to make it right back
Would I be a fools to look back to the hills
From which cometh my help
Lord knows I need help
If not I might fail
Thought I was doing great, but
I was just feeling myself, so

[Chorus]
I'm not letting one minute, moment, second pass
Without saying, "Thank You, Lord"
Thank You, Lord
For Your many blessings
Gave me everything I need and more
Even when I don't deserve it
You still watch over my family
And keep 'em safe from all harm and danger
A better man is what I'm tryna be
So I praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em
Thank Ya, thank Ya, thank Ya
I just lift my hands and clap 'em, clap 'em

[Bridge]
Jesus still on the mainline
You just tell Him what you want
My God is still on the mainline
Yeah, praise Him, praise Him
Clap 'em, Clap 'em

[Chorus]
Heavenly Father
Give power to me
Over temptation
In my hour of need
Say I'm not forsaken
Shower over me
All of Your patience
My stone ain't ready

[Verse 1: Sly Pyper]
Been a sinner for a while now
All of Your forgiveness
I might not deserve it
Sort of known to wild out
Okay to let your flaws show
Nobody is perfect
Hard for me to bow down
I was taught to stand up to anybody, anywhere, for anything
My hood, holy ground
Street war for fun
Taught to walk through hellfire with the kerosene
So quick to turn it up a notch
Low profiles, spinning, burnin up the lot
Always got that new thing turning up ya block
Always drive-by shooting, hard to make it stop
Pray for me
I'm something like a work in progress
Somebody already know
Pray for me
We already knew I needed someone to save my soul

[Chorus]

Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Let him chisel away away away
Please believe
He's workin on me
He's workin on me
Jesus

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
Heaven Father, let me lead by example
Let me be Your servant
Give you the true word that's spoken
Have ya heard it?
Have ya noticed?
Don't be deceived
By temptation of man
Realize, understand
That it's not your plan
That it's only God's plan (say what?!)
Do you really understand?
Open ya hands
Close em, praise Him
For all salvation
Give You the praisin'
Welcome to the party
So glad that you made it
My wrongs, my rights
I put em in yo faith
Just love, no hate
Try to keep us all straight
Till we see that day
See
Life is how you make it
Reject it, or you take it
Be real, or you fake it
Mistake and be patient
I'm tellin' you now
Things gettin real in the situation, boy
Don't fake it
24/7 tryna get in heaven
But ya attitude and ya mind state
Don't bite more than you can chew, homeboy
Don't try to eat the whole plate

[Chorus]

Let Him chisel away away away
Let Him chisel away away away
Let him chisel away away away
Please believe
He's workin on me
Keep workin on me
Jesus
You cannot have the crown without the cross

I'm talkin about somewhere in your life there is a cross
That drives you to the Father
Ladies and gentlemen

I know, I know that it's coming
A blessing is coming my way, yeah
Not comin in houses
Worth more than silver and gold, yeah
I rather have you in my soul
Even when the world thinks it's a joke
Churches talkin' holy, but no ghost
People dyin', steady losing hope

Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
So i'mma keep running this race, yeah
And nobody killing my faith, yeah

Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
The way they see you flex here
When I get to heaven I'mma say Amen
Say Amen, yeah
Grab my crown and run and dance
Run and dance
Praise him 'cause I made it in
Made it in
Yessir

When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Say amen
'cause one day, one day
I'm gonna get my crown
One day, one day
I'm gonna wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
Yeah
One day, one day, one day
I shall wear a crown

So, so many people so cold
'cause they don't really know ya'
Oh thank you Lord
Standing hollerin' God we trust
But do they really love ya'? (do they, do they)
Connected by the truth that hurts us right now
Pray for the path that keeps shutting me down
Try to take my life and shut it all out
Oh Lord, we need you right now
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
So i'mma keep running this race, yeah
And nobody killing my faith, yeah

Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
Woah I can't wait to see your face, yeah
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Grab my crown and run and dance

Praise him 'cause I made it in
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Say amen
'cause one day, one day
I'm gonna get my crown
One day, one day
I'm gonna wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
Yeah
One day, one day, one day
I shall wear a crown

See believing is really knowing the unknown
Something we can not see
So far gone, that's come blind to our eyes
But it's time for us to wake up and realise we need God
Begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
Before the rising sun, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly
We fly, we fly, we fly

So many roads to choose
We'll start out walking and learn to run
And yes, we've just begun

[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days

[Bridge]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
And there never was a cloudy day
There never was a cloudy day

[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Hands up, we back in, born in the rage
Untamed, break free, beast out of the cage
Sky rainin' down flames, it's a war on the heavens
A beautiful scene in the night behind light
And much like that, when I'm dreamin', I'm in flight
Coast out of site, though I'm feelin' I'm not right
And Hell's got one hell of a grip, no shit
Your boy best not slip, get stuck in your grave
Just to live another day, fightin' through decay
Call on my angels and I kneel as I pray
Got my mind, my soul and my heart on the same wave
It took me a minute, now I'm all in it, damn
While I'm out of the dark, I push it to the limit, friend
So ready, I'm sharp, here comes the demolition man
Pack 'em up and just hittin', aimin' and never missin'
Servin' up the prescription, no time for intermission
Rippin'

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me

[Chorus: Billy Corgan & Kid Cudi]
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oh, no
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Nooooooo, oh
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yo
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
The world's got hope in the city with a reward
Made for the pain, it's a battle I'm runnin' toward
Call to the don, I'm embracin' it to the core
Forced into fightin', get ready for many more
And I'm for mine from the jump, I ride or die with the pump
I'm squeezin' for that release, I aim and let it dump
I hear a roar of a sound, I'm feelin' it through the ground
Mayhem in the city, escapin' but I am found
I rise up amongst the many with no fear
Full squad, we at it, we finish 'em all, clear
Through the rubble, we rumble, never runnin' from trouble
Keep my head on a swivel, you know I'm scorin' for double
Searchin' for that release, swimmin' at it, repeat
Wash your hands of them sins and fightin' 'til we see peace
It's the least we could do in a world that needs the brave
Know the lost can be saved, survivin' the end of days

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me

[Chorus: Billy Corgan & Kid Cudi]
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone & Swae Lee]
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night?
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
My necklace had a natural glow
She dancin' in the strobe
Let's fuckin' spoil my night (Spoil my night)
Spent so much cash, I lost her
My cup was too toxic
I took the robe off (Yeah)
I couldn't get her off me
Dropped plenty money on her thighs
There's plenty room in my ride
I've never been like a small fry
She took me in, that's on my life

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night

Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me
Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (Ooh)
Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)
I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)
And she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)
I see her smilin' back at me (Back at me)
I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)
It's about time, Postmate Plan B
Now she whippin' out her phone and I know (And I know)
Damn, how many videos you gon' post?
Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know
My girl at home now my line about to blow (Yeah)
I know what I'm doin' ain't right
But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Post Malone]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night (My night)
Spoil my night, spoil my night
I don't have much to say, I'll be out front
Won't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)
Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time (Yeah)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Spoil my night, spoil my night
Spoil my night, spoil my night

[Verse 1]
Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Verse 2]
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

[Bridge]
(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

'Cause I just spent a hundred bands in one night
Spent a hundred bands in one night

OGs put me on tours, so I'm laced, bro
Real recognizin' that you don't speak the lingo
Clothes all new, not a wrinkle
Givin' you the game, gettin' sprinkled
Bottles on deck and my drink full

[Verse 1]
I used to say I was free
Now all these people wanna keep on takin' pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out, right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you (Breeze for you)
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Watchin' me bleed
You cut me down on my knees
No matter what you believe
I think we both can agree

[Chorus]
That you can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

[Verse 2]
Every day's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go
As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

[Chorus]
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
I couldn't breathe
Almost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all
You can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault

[Bridge]
It's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes
It's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah
It's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul
It's all my fault

Watchin' me bleed (Watchin' me bleed)
You cut me down on my knees (You cut me down on my knees)

[Chorus]
That you can't blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault
Blame it on me (Ayy)
It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault

Speaker system bumpin', fuck your fuckin' block up (Fuck your block up)
Used to mock him, now it's custom Bentley mock-ups (Mock-ups)

Four hunnid pairs of Gucci socks (Socks)
I lost all my friends, made a lot of foes
Made a lot of M's, made a lot of moves
Open up the safe (Ooh), I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458, cost me 250 (Yeah)
Man, look at all my ice (Ice)
I hit your main thing twice (Your main thing twice)
Take a word of advice (A word of advice)
Break up with that ho (Ho)

We got London On Da Track

[Chorus 1]
I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth (Of an ugly truth)
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you (They can't replace you)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus 2]
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (Take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (What am I to do?)
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth (What an ugly truth)
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through (And we can make it through)

[Verse 2]
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

[Refrain]
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Outro]
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet (Yet)
Waitin' on the plug, but he ain't come yet (Yet)
Still need somethin'? Put your bank on it (Bank on it)
Got a big bag with a Bape on it (Bape on)

Sexy motherfucker in a cartoon
Saint Laurent, forty on a new suit
Sippin' Bud Light, that's a new cruise
Baby, bust it open like woo-hoo
The diamonds got cut like a boo-boo
Pockets so fat, rock a muu-muu
Me and Dre came for the pum pum
Drippin', drippin', drippin', women tryna take my millions
Help my bro with an assist I'm Jason Williams (White Chocolate)
Heard that there's a party, I might pay a visit (Visit)
That's a moment, hopped out frog like ribbit, ribbit (Skrrt)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow (The blow)
Thirty more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road (On the road)
Already losin' control, this is the life that we chose

[Chorus]
Drinkin' all night, but we ain't done yet (Yet)

[Verse 2]
Frontin' on me, but you love it (Love it)
Tryna act like you above it ('Bove it)
Dad bod know you wanna rub it (Rub it)
Have you ever done it in public?
Sippin' all night, let it rotate
Baby, just for the night, you my soulmate
Mixin' vodka with the champagne
Tell me how much liquor can a man take
How many records have I sold?
I don't even know, can't keep count (Nope)
You know that I've been on a roll
Celebratin' life when I come around (Come around)
Sippin' all night, sippin' all day
Brought the beerbong out like a tailgate
Holdin' big words that I can't say
Got me speakin' drunkanese, can you translate?

[Pre-Chorus]
Drunk when I walked in the door, so fuckin' high like, "Hello"
I told her pour me some more, then she went right for the blow (The blow)
Thirty more girls wanna roll, let's get this bitch on the road (On the road)

[Intro]
Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open
Stuntin', knowin' everybody watchin', yeah, yeah
And help another bitch out the whip
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, yeah, yeah
Just to show you that it's over
It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah
I'ma put that bitch pussy in a motherfuckin' bodybag
So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

[Pre-Chorus]
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change (Is gonna change), yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy
You know I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
Buy me love, tried to buy me love
Now I'm alone, Ice Box, Omarion (Ooh)
Plenty sluts grabbin' on my nuts (Whoa)
Might have fucked, it was only lust (Trust)
I was livin' life, how could I have known? (Could have known)
Couldn't listen to advice 'cause I'm never wrong (Oh)
In the spotlight, but I'm on my own (Oh)

Yo, gotta hit him on the jack
When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?
Everything is intact
Coulda been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards (Oh-oh-oh)
Back to you, I'm so into you
For real, breh like I'm kin to you
If you a 10, I add 10 to you
They be mad when I tend to you

Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like (Oh-oh-oh)
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo

[Intro]
*lighter flick*
Aye

[Verse 1]
I'm a lover, not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is five stories, I don't tell 'em, I don't write 'em
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright, I'mma need a sun visor
187 make your bitch run my errands
At the bar with the Dracula, ordering Bloody Marys
Got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see Hell out my window, Lord, this view is amazing
If I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands, it got all under my nails
People under the stairs, better not fuck with my feet
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Niggas biting my style, hope it gets stuck in their teeth
I been had the green light, now please don't jump in the street
C'est la vie, oui oui oui, watch me french kiss the sky
Then ask, "What is that smell?" That's the shit on my mind
I don't like you, or niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my motherfucking idol
Keep a brown rifle for niggas like you
Kill you in a drive-thru, then go viral
Ooh, I don't like you and niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my idol
The Glock 17 is still a minor I'll kill you over something minor
I get at you, night Twighlight whine like a wine-o, high like a high-note
Go at your head like a rhino, leave your shit bloody red like albino
I'm a nigga with a title, care less bout' a nigga title
I'm entitled and get homicidal
Wild as El Chapo, wild as Al Qaeda
Stuntin' on my rivals upon arrival
Numbers aren't liars, I am number one
I am on one
I am on ten stuntin' on twelve
I keep it a hunnid
Oh Lord!

[Chorus]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules

Help me please, help me please
Get pleased whenever I please
Hercules, hercules

[Verse 2]
I'm twisting up the kush, Sticky Fingaz like Onyx
Throwing up gang signs, you can see em' all in my vomit
I'm sleeping with the enemy, in bulletproof pajamas
I'm cool like that, but the climate is climbing
I got issues bigger than you, I got bitches taller than me
All that ratchet and bougie, I guess I like R&B
I'm unapologetic, I'm sorry for not being sorry
These niggas so old news, I’m talking prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finger
Bad bitches for my homeboys
The grass is greener on the other side
I'm focused on my own yard
Focused on getting more dough
Twisting up like torsos
Rich as fuck, but moreso a poor soul
Oh well, if snow fell like hoes fell, then I'd be a snowman
My bitch is a soldier, fuck me GI Joe-Ann
They thought I ain't had no chance
I took the dice and rolled them
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder
Ahhhh!

[Chorus 2]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Strong arm your own team
Murder scene, murder scene

Help me please, help me please
Nigga please, nigga please

[Verse 3]
They worship me certainly
Purple lean, purple weed
Percocet, pericyazine
Search a scene, search a dean
Search a bling, ching ching
Search the queen
Search her purse, search her clean
Search his turf, search his team
Search the sleeve, check for wings
First, I curse, then I squeeze
They say they lit? where the steam?
Let em' live, let em' breathe
Let em' live, let em' breathe?
Nigga please, nigga please

[Chorus 3]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Strong arm your own team
Murder scene, murder scene
Murder team, murder team
We murder teams, murder teams
Lil Tunechi picked out the rock like

[Bridge]
Oh Lord, Oh Lord

Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Whole squad on Mars
And you don't make enough noise

Mercy me, mercy me
Rest In Peace Mercy D
My grandmother nurtured me
And that's who you bout' to meet

[Outro]

Say I talk fresh and you kick me out
You smoke cigarettes out front of your house
Is this what you want?
Well, it's what you got
I'm sure gonna miss you when I'm gone

You got real nice friends, oh what a pack
They all talk shit behind your back
Yeah, you cut me deep, but it's all good
In this fucking waste of a neighborhood

And you're nothing
And you're nothing
And you're nothing
You're nothing

Last time I saw you, you were huffing glue
I said God doesn't love me man, he loves you
You said that's a lie man, that's not true
I just take up space now, just like you
I said I love you
You said who are you
I said I love you
You said who are you
I think I liked you better when you were younger

And you're nothing
And you're nothing
And you're nothing
You're nothing
You keep going with that bow in your hair
And I know that you're sorry, and I know that you care
You keep talkin' and you're makin' me sick
But I know that you miss me, and I know that you're scared

This little man's got serious plans
You know that he listens when you think he's not there
This heart is gold and this light is a gift
So just give me a kiss and I'll get out of your hair

We'll live in squalor and we'll live off the land, and
We'll be so happy because we understand
We'll live in squalor and we'll live off the land, and
We'll be so happy because we so understand

(We'll live in squalor and we'll live off the land
We'll be so happy because we so understand)
I heard a story the other day
About a kid I knew who couldn't stay awake
He was sleeping through my favorite movie
I forget what it's called but I know it was moving

Then someone shook him
And he opens his eyes
But his dreams have already taken over his mind
He's yelling like somebody's causing him pain
But there's nobody there but the things in his brain

His mom took him down to a hospital
And they hooked up his head to this real awful machine
Now he's laughing like something is funny
He says that it's funny
He thinks he's somebody
Who walks along the universe and tells his god that nothing could be worse than staying awake at this movie
It's dumb and it's tough and it is really boring
Watch your mouth, or I'll make you wash it out
I will teach you to be good, Mary

Cause after all you locked yourself, in a dream and all
The very, very special things you've seen won't mean a thing

And all your friends wanna sail around the bend
But I won't let them take your wind, Mary

And even still you got this far, but you're not there and all
The little things that got you here won't get you anywhere

So you be kind, and I will take you back through time
I will take away your pain, Mary
I listened to your CD on the bus on my way home
I'll tell you what I think when I can organize my thoughts into a poem

I saw you at our show, I didn't know you knew the words
I wish I looked into your mouth when you started to sing the second verse
I wonder what you think about when your head's up in space
I wonder if you'd ever want me to show you my favorite hiding place
I want to meet him
Can't wait to see him
He looks like something that I'd see in a museum
His thoughts are empty
He's lookin' dirty
And I could hurt him cause I know he wouldn't stop me
But you don't need to feel so upset

Don't talk to me and pretend you care
He's not here, he's not there, he's not anywhere

I've got a notion
There's no emotion
He's just an auto-response to the commotion
He's got no future
He's just a loser
There are no meds to pull his head out of this stupor
You got his number
He's like a sunburn
You'll always itch it til you scratch, you never learn
Don't forget
That it's all in your head

Don't look at me and pretend you care
I'm not here, I'm not there, I'm not anywhere
And someone told on you
And they said that you cried but that's a lie
He wakes up at night
And he feels as if he is dying
Tell him to stop trying

I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
And if there's one thing I regret
It's my lack of regrets
So what a mess
And somebody once said
It's only love that makes a liar
That's just what I heard

And I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half
I am a saw
I'll cut you in half

I got a ringing in my head and I wish it would stop
I got too many people here tryna watch me get off
You think you're pretty cause you're smart well look what you caught
Just an easy motherfucker wasting all that he's got
You made the pretty little things and now you're gone
I get sick in the basement when you're gone
I start walking in the graveyards when you're gone
I start to smile for the camera and now you're gone

She carved your name in her chest it's a scar tattoo
She wiped the blood of her dress, scar tattoo
She stabs you in the back, it's a scar tattoo
I wake up at night and I wish I was you
You made the pretty little things and now you're gone
I get sick in the basement when you're gone
I start walking in the graveyards when you're gone
I start to smile for the camera and now you're gone

You made the pretty little things and now you're gone
I get sick in the basement when you're gone
I start walking in the graveyards when you're gone
I start to smile for the camera and now you're gone
You made the pretty little things and now you're gone
I get sick in the basement when you're gone
I start walking in the graveyards when you're gone
I start to smile for the camera and now you're gone
Touch me Stephanie and I'll make you healthy again
There ain't nothing you know that's too broke for me to mend
Now your mother told me to take your temperature
Keep still now you wouldn't wanna disobey her

Make sure when I need my fix tonight, you're looking alright
When I need my fix tonight, you're looking alright

Punish me Stephanie and I'll make you love someone new
There ain't no one you know who's not in love with you
And I'm breaking my back just to know that you're alright
And the least you could do is just let me tuck you in tonight

Make sure when I get my fix tonight, you're looking alright
Make sure when I get my fix tonight, you're looking alright

Ooh Mama
Ooh Mama

Yeaaa
What a big mess you got me in
Sin, sin, sin, under my skin
What a big mess you got me in
Sin, sin, sin under my skin

Stupid kid does stupid things
Acid trip on the techno scene
Every five minutes, it's a bigger dream
Every five minutes, it's a bigger dream

Tie me down
I am allowed
Tie me down
I am allowed

I don't wanna feel this sick anymore
Open up the back door
Tell me where to go
I don't wanna feel this sick anymore
Open up the back door
Same as before
'Cause I am a monkey man
Take me to monkey land
I am a monkey man
I got no other plans

Tie me down
I am allowed
Tie me down
'Cause I am allowed
Tie me down
I am allowed
Tie me down
I am allowed
I know there's nothing in there
But i don't care

I am your holy father
Don't be scared

Above that dying kingdom
I am there

I will tear your heart out
Don't be scared

You will live forever
So dry your eyes

Or i will drink your tears
And make them mine

Oh god
I am your soul
Oh darling
What have you done
When nobody is at home
Everybody just wants that
Inside their hearts

Yeah i can't help it if I'm stoned
I'm just another mothafucka
With a guitar

Everybody is alone
But at least everybody knows
That god loves them

So i guess everyone's okay
Everybody is Okay
Okay Okay Okay

Help me
Help you

Help me
Help you
Help me
Help you
Baby, it's not me it's you
Baby, it's not me it's you
Baby, it's not me it's you

Baby, when I'm alone again
Baby, when I'm alone again
Maybe

Watch the screen
It’ll tell you what to do
Watch the screen
It’ll tell you what to do
Biked over to the school to get one last run
With my best friend Rudolph
'Cause that's how we have fun

Biked over to the school to get one last run
With my best friend Rudolph
That's how we have fun

And that's all I needed it to be
Oh
And that's all I needed it to be
For me
That's all I need it to be
Oh
And that's all I need it to be

Don't wanna talk to girls about having sex
Just wanna hang with my friends
That's what I know best
Don't wanna talk to girls about having sex
Just wanna be with friends
'Cause that's what I know best
And that's all I needed it to be
Oh
And that's all I needed it to be
For me
And that's all I needed it to be
Oh
And that's all I needed it to be
For me

Bum bum
Bum bum
Bum bum
Read me my tarot
'Cause I wanna know
What my future can tell you
Before I grow up
Look it up
Dig for me, baby

Look for your sister
She lives all alone
And sought everyone's pocket
Except for your own
Where'd you go wrong?
Dig for me, baby

Where are you going?
OH BABY GIRL
Where Are You Going?
You know we got so much more to do
You know the games are just beginning
Don't make me have to chase after you

And I hate you
And all your lies
You're a sore sight
For sore eyes

Oh, officer, you know I’m dying here
Shot through the heart and through the head
But sir, you know
You know the coast is clear
Rest of the men can go ahead

I'm feeling sick
I'm feeling down
And I hope you cringe
When you hear this sound
Bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
All I wanna do is carry you
All I wanna do is hurt you

Baby, I love those things you do
And all I wanna do is skull love you

Oh, baby, I don't need the truth
All I wanna do is skull love you
Oh, baby, I don't need the truth
'Cause all I wanna do is skull love you
I learned a thing or two from you
Don't let them in
Don't lure them through
There is a race inside my mind
It's where I go to pass the time
The time

I am not pushing you away
I'm just living in yesterday
I wish you'd hold me like you would
Before you knew I was no good
No good

There is a problem with your blood
It's clotting up
It's made of mud
I want to drain it out of you
And drink it down and be caught too
Flawed too

There is a problem with your head
You can't bring yourself out of bed
I want to lie there next to you
And make you laugh like I used to
Used to
I'm going backwards now through time
Don't wake me up
Don't change my mind
Change my mind
Change my mind
Daddy says I'm bad
Mommy thinks I'm too sad
I am not like you
Cuz I do what I want to
And I take it and break it
To fix myself
And if I fake it
To take it
I do it for my health
And this one's just for me
My happy little dream

But will she be the one
To keep us together

Trust me baby we're all right
But I don't wanna see you tonight
Why don't you call me
When you think you're on my team
I got a bloody nose
Waiting for my oxyclean
But will she be the one
To keep us together

She disappeared into the sun
This is what we won
Now this is what we won
You sit for hours I know Kara’s here
I see her crawling out your ears
Painting the water
Red for something good
Blue for what is not but could

Blue is the color of Kara’s flame
And this one burns for you babe

And in your letter I read trace of pink
Repeat the pattern in your brain
There is an answer

I saw her eating shells
Pencil in pastel
Do not look me in the eye

Blue is the color of Kara’s flame
And this one burns for you babe
Tapping out
In my head I see bright lights
Riding in
I think I'm feeling it now
Just like you did

Taking hits for you
'Cause I wanna feel like I'm supposed to
I could disappear
If this is what makes me feel so real

And I'd break for you baby
'Cause you make it feel so good
And I'd break for you baby
'Cause you make it feel so good
And I'd break for you baby
'Cause you make it feel so good
And I'd break for you baby
'Cause you make it feel so good

Hold me down
And maybe I'll quit if you stick around
Keep quiet
It's the only place I know, but it's my favorite
And I'm sick for you, baby
And it's never gonna go away
And I'm sick for you, baby
And it's never gonna go away
And I'm sick for you, baby
And it's never gonna go away
And I'm sick for you, baby
And it's never gonna go away
M-m-m-maybe
B-b-b-baby
They'll teach you how to feel

M-m-m-maybe
B-b-b-baby
I’ll put you in my will

M-m-m-maybe
B-b-b-baby
You just need the thrill

M-m-m-maybe
B-b-b-baby
No

And I feel it all the time
And it hurts me every time
Cause I see you all the time
And I miss you every time
I let you spit in my hair
I know you wish I wasn't there
I'm sorry for
The things I said before

I know you're different
I know you're scared
And when you stop crying
Maybe I will stop lying

I saw you grieving
When everyone was leaving
I felt what you were feeling
Some people call that stealing
I've been lying
In my basement
I wanna call you, but I can't speak out
Too many uppers
Too many downers
I had a problem, but I'm over it now

Being somebody is just something to be
Being somebody is just something to be
Being somebody is just something to be
Being somebody is just something to be

Me and my mother
Went to the doctor
They tied me up and took my insides out
They got some scissors
And clipped my feathers
And now I got nothing to worry about

Being somebody is just something to be
Being somebody is just something to be
Being somebody is just something to be
Being somebody is just something to be

[Intro]
You've got the music
You've got the music
You've got the music
Don't you?
You've got the music
Don't you?

[Verse 1]
Down on the West Coast, they've got a sayin':
"If you're not drinkin' then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the music, you for the music
It's true, it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else who brings me higher and higher
You pull me close, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me, and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close when you say, hush baby hush

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love, I'm in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feelin' hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else, brings me higher and higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

You pull me close, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me, and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close when you say, hush baby hush

[Outro]
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Looking back I see a million little things that wrecked us
She never liked my pickup truck parked up beside her Lexus
And I never wore them khakis like she asked me
Just trashy old blue jeans, old Skoal ring

[Pre-Chorus]
She packed up her Chanel, said 'go to hell', taught me a lesson
And now as far as she's concerned
I'm in a deep and dark depression

[Chorus]
But it's happy hour, drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy Waylon hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I know she'll hear about my 'paint the town red' gallivanting
And she'll think I thought of her curves when I found that gal to dance with
And she'll tell her friends I'm faking, my hearts breaking, time will take away my grin
But not when every bar I stumble in

[Chorus]
Is happy hour, drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done

[Bridge]
Well it'll make her feel much better if she thinks my life is hell
Tell her ever since she left me it's like time is standing still

[Chorus]
And it's happy hour, drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done
Yeah, I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah
Well, well, well...
I gotta get away from you, girl, as fast as I can
Too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

Oh, I'm thinkin' 'bout all those times you left me at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

Said the road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm sick and tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sho'nuff, lady, I just got to...

Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
Talkin' 'bout I'm the one you're leavin'
Said I done had my fill of you
Girl, you've cut me so through the years
I done sho'nuff ran out of tears
I couldn't cry if I wanted to

Said the road has got to end somewhere, honey honey
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm givin' you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road, road, road

(This is the end of our road)
I, I can't take it no more
(This is the end of our road)
Packin' up my clothes, walk out the door
(This is the end of our road)
I, I can't take it no more
(This is the end of our road)
Packin' up my clothes, walking out the door...

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm in my prime, Optimus
Sagittarius, so you know I'm an optimist
Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (Okay)
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (Bucket list)
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss
How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)
Was it worth it, dummy? I ain't mind a bit
Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (Okay)
Ritchie like Guy and I still eat Thai
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, sis, nice try

[Chorus]
Let's be real, all my children wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you girls cookie good like me
Cookie so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty sissy wish she  could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my hittas off, but they would still wife me (Still wife me)

[Verse 2]
Rap chickens tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me
All they do is copy looks, steal music too
Want to see what chickens do when they lose the blue-print
I mean the pinkprint, so let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only hitta that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big 3, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet
That's Lil Weezy, the Barbie and Drizzy Drake
And we gettin' more cheese, kissy face
I'm a bad thick, busty chick (Uh)
Kids get slick, I'ma cut the stick
I'm a bad thick, dusty sit (Okay)
If that chick get slick, I'll cut the chick
I'll cut up the chick, I'll gut the chick (Okay)
Had to rough up the chick, handcuff the chick
Won't shoot her but I will gun butt the chick
When we say "done the chick" it's up the chick
She was stuck-up so my hittas stuck up the chick
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the chick
Get the combination to the safe, drug the chick
Know the whole operation been bugged the chick

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (Okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (Okay)
Ritchie like Guy and I still eat Thai
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, sis, nice try

[Chorus]
Let's be real, all my children wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan of you girls cookie good like me
Cookie so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty sissy wish she could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my hittas off, but they would still wife me (Still wife me)

[Verse 3]
They would still wife me
They would still wife me
Yup, him too, he would still wife me
Ahh, ha
When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence
When it's clear they bite me, I'm flattered they like me
I don't wanna check kittens, tell 'em wear their Nikes
Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings
Big Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings
Big Barbie tings, that's Barbie tings
Uh, Barbie dreamhouse, Barbie rings
That's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz
Barbie white picket, Barbie fence
All tea, all shade, sis, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's ken
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Most niggas think I'm redundant
Because I like to take my shopping sprees out in London
I go to the can
I go shop in Japan
A diamond black card I get as much as I can, man
My set of chains seems so real
Imagination change the way that it feels
'Cause it's soft
Ice Creams and Dunks
My girl rock Louis Vuitton pumps you'd ask how much it costs
My nigga I go hard, I rock Goyard, Supreme- oh God
Thought I had to wear black just to kick bush
'Till a mechanic button pushed me just to get pushed
Niggas know I'm a teenage millionaire
Got Polos to match every color Care Bear
I get fit with Ralph Lauren, white tees is borin'
That's why I rock the best
My nigga get fresh

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color coordinated (get fresh)
Man I color coordinated this so (get fresh)
He is color coordinated (it's fresh)

[Verse 2: Burtono]
Yeah, all white Polos, self title'd jeans
Philiano Burtono, dog on everything
Ya boy Philiano is OTC
And as a boy I'd shop out this country
Ya boy Philiano got his own clothing
What's the name of it? It's named after me
You ain't gotta stay tuned, this ain't a cartoon
Son, where in apartments Burtono, it's coming soon
Red, white, blue, that's so fresh
Black on black, you look like a mess
The funny part about it, I'm so funny
I'm so fresh to death, I sweat money
I love it, chillin' in the public
300 bucks for the Rock & Republics
I don't know, but I'm not the best
I stay, I'm just tryna impress
But just get fresh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I go to Beverly Hills for perfection
Just so I can scope out the new Polo Hanson
My own clothing gives me an erection
I like to jack off to my own clothing
Nigga, check my wallet and see how much I'm holding
A new Bathing Ape t-shirt I'm unfolding
Cuffed pants, Bloxhead main attraction
Where my jeans now have a creative reaction
When my jeans get ripped up from my crew
Probably because my new printing label look blue
Orange, yellow, green, pink I got fits
My closet has thicker silicone than Lil Kim's tits
And as you could tell I'm on a mission
'Cause I got more True Religion than a Christian
I'm rockin in public, Banana Republic
You rockin Akademik jeans? I'm rockin Rock & Republic
Papers with Os on the check, T-Shirt with Vs on the neck, my flow is sicker than AIDS patients havin sex
And you know what's next, I'm one of the best
Yes, I'm not even gonna tell you the rest
My nigga get fresh

[Outro]
Oooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, oh oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

You got my future in your hands, hey hey
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ah hey, yeah yeah
Didn't I? Oh baby

[Verse 2]
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Ah, I’m yours!
Ooh wee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, whoa-oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

You got my future in your hands, baby, yeah
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man
But here, I, ahh, with your future, got your future, baby, I, I
Signed, sealed, delivered, I’m yours!
Here I am, baby, ahh
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

[Verse 1]
I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
That'd be my excuse
I can tell my crew
'Cause the body's hot
But the face is wrong
So they gon' clown on me
All night long

So I take a shot
Take another shot
Never drinkin' up
'Till her face is hot
Till I can't no more
System overload
Sayin' baby lemme take you home

I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
See I want a ten
But you're just a two
So let's keep it low
Keep it secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
That I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
I said I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
She don't look ugly now
'Cause I'm fucked up now
That might sound fucked up now
Oh well

[Verse 2]
I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
That way I won't know why
I woke up with you
Need to find a girl
That'll do me here
Ain't performing 'night
Got no groupies here
Cause I ain't famous yet
But I will be soon
If you come with me
Then you will be too
How many songs do I need before I finally get 

[?]?
Who knows? Who knows?
I'm not fucking you
'Less I'm drunk as you
Mr bartender better bring his too
And keep my glass full
To the tippy top
'Till this girl right here
Looks like Megan Fox

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
I said I'm fucked up now
I'm fucked up now
She don't look ugly now
'Cause I'm fucked up now
That might sound fucked up now
Oh well

And keep my autotune on
My autotune on
Keep my autotune on
My autotune on
Don't turn that shit off
'Cause I sound like shit
Don't turn that shit off
Man, what'd I just say
Damn
After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink

But I'm wild again, beguiled again
Simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Oh I lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Oh!
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot
But now I'm sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
Bewitched! Bothered! And bewildered, am I

[Intro]
Oh na na

[Verse 1]
When I was tall enough
I was already on my way
But I can't go

'Cause you were like
Tell me like
And I wasted all my weight
Don't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you go
I can take it, take it, no
When you're up and down
When you're up and down

Don't go
I can't take anymore when you're
When you're up and down
When you're up and down, I know

[Chorus]
'Cause I go the wrong the wrong way
Imma the wrong the wrong way
And you're all along along the way
I don't know, I don't know

So when you go
Don't come around
Don't tear me down tonight
I'mma get it on and on

[Verse 2]
All in one night
I was only by your side
Yeah yeah uh

Just off one light
I was only by you
But I didn't, no no

'Cause I don't wanna go, I go away
I just wanna make you make you stay
'Cause I'd rather
Go up and down
Go up and down, babe
I don't wanna go, I go away
I just wanna make you make you stay
'Cause I wanna
Go up and down
No way, no way

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you go
I can take it, take it no
When you're up and down
When you're up and down

Don't go
I can't take it no more when you're
When you're up and down
When you're up and down, I know

[Chorus]
'Cause I go the wrong the wrong way
Imma go the wrong the wrong way
And you're all along along the way
I don't know
I don't know

So when you go
Don't come around
Don't tear me down tonight
I'mma get it on and on

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(Late night when you need my love)
(Call me on my cell phone)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)

[Verse 1]
You might have heard about me, heard I got raw instrumentals
Ignore me in the hall when you saw me in my trenchcoat
Shrugged me off when I was rappin' in the cypher
Assumed I was dumb in class 'cause I was actin' hyper
Well let the ambiguity cease, there's no awkwardness now
It's just you and me, and I produce all these beats so just close your eyes
You give me sixty minutes and I'll blow your mind
From the depths of my depression kicked toes in the wall
To the time I fought TJ, and called on EJ
The tales of a lost teen, I'm here in my basement
Almost eighteen, wondering where the days went
Staring at blankness about to attack like, rarely complacent
Let me tell you what that's like
You can call me underground as long as you call me sincere
Not only am I coming out I feel like I've always been here

[Chorus]
I'm one
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

[Bridge]
Imma just like on my back looking at the sky
And then go in the park enchanted by the kids passing by
Actually, yeah I wrote this in my basement sober
Oh good, a less poetic a lot more Mike Posner

[Verse 2]
For everybody that's fed up with teachers and parents
Mad middle class, high school students embarrassed
For everybody frustrated with the opposite sex
Who regret it when he sees him with no confidence left
I put music in it that you weren't expecting
So kids who hate rap can maybe respect this
Only intelligent kids can handle Mike's shit
Name another rapper rapping over pianos like this
I'm something else, new wave, original
Fuck a punch line, everything I say is literal
Black t-shirts, grey sweats, and green eyes
I don't fit in with other kids and I bet you see why
I'm an awkward kid that if you know in advance
My goal is to steal half a bed full his fans
An' they no got you a musical pioneer
And guess what else?
(What what what)
I'm here

[Chorus]
I'm here
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

[Verse 3]
The more they see its not about runnin" round with the in crowd
The more I see they only say it 'cause they're not in it
Why take direction from a teacher, port-a-potty of society, end up like him?
Fuck that, an' I am me
Life's a big high school: you cool or not?
Another cool did time, I schooled the thought
Whether you new or not I give you food for thought
But I lose a lot of trust, trying to prove I'm hot
'Cause in real life I'm awkward, anti-social, self-conscience, intellectually advanced, emotional
But my raps give me a chance to be boastful 'cause I know I'm sweet
Well actually I'm hopeful
Now surely you'll react 'cause I don't rap for you
I write to myself and that's that, it's through
The bass shakes my walls and my ceiling darks
I'm here feel that energy building up
Come on

[Chorus]
I'm here
As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

As you go to class I'm with you
Throw me in the trash I'll come back to get you
I'm here
In my bake basement as I write this
And I swear
I really don't care if you like this

(Seasons change and so did I)

(School's out for summer
School's out forever)

(It was you who made my blue eyes blue)

(Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right)

[Chorus]
I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

[Verse 1]
I'm leavin'
I'm gone
Please miss me
I'm almost done talkin'
Come on keep listening
This may be the last verse I ever rap out
No sweatpants now this one with the cap and gown
Graduated from high school
Graduated from rapping
Graduated from parents and graduated from you faggots
Graduated from track and basketball
Graduated from weed, now I've got Adderall
I'm goin' to college where the weather is nice
You gonna listen to this and remember me like
That was a weird kid I saw him rappin' thought I knew him
In ten years I wonder what's ever gonna happen to him
But I made it through eighteen years
I raise the champagne glass and I say to my peers
"I'm gone, happy it's over glad it was fun
Party one last time yo this chapter is done
Cos after today this is my life
You not gon hear from me again you better listen to my rhymes
There's nothing left here for me to put into my music
I'll go to college start over come back with some new shit"

[Chorus]
I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

[Verse 2]
Blue skies, puffy clouds
Sixty minutes later, you heard enough from me now
Cuban in my mouth I've got you smokin' with me
This is my coming of age, live this moment with me
Nobody's flawless like I want my girl to be
But what I've realised is you people mean the world to me
Without you I'd have noone to make fun of and tease
Without your stupidity I could never be genius
In the winter that concept was so far fetched
Now I am 

[?]
I say goodbye to my closest of brothers
Sayonara to high school, adios to my mother
Retire the notepad imma miss these raps
And the librarians at school can kiss my ass
Before I leave we'll sit down and have a beer or two
But if not, I'll just see you next year at Duke

[Chorus]
I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

I'm gone but I gave this to you
Don't worry imma miss you too
I was wrong on the first song
I'm rappin' to you but my work is done here
Yo this chapter is through

Haha I didn't mean to sound like an asshole with the last line
I didn't mean to come off pompous or arrogant but
It's just like I made it
I'm leaving here with

[?]
Next year I'll be in the Sarah P. Duke Gardens, google that shit
Throwin' the frizbee around
You know I'm never coming back right?
I mean I'll be back on holidays for the first couple of years but
I'm never coming back
Peace
Life goes on

[Verse 1]
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape

[Verse 2]
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
I shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seen
Thank you!

Smoke weed, get drunk (Wasted)
She wanna see a nigga trap

[Verse 3]
Hoes ain't loyal, I'ma take a vacay
Private jet to Hawaii, I'm just tryna get laid
Got a whole bus full of bitches, nigga getting paid
Got too many freaks, I don't never need space
Two shots to the head, shawty said she need a chase
Babysitting, now she see all my kids on her face
Rolex in the club, it's a time and a place for everything
Getting faded minus the shakes
It's the weekend, I ain't giving a fuck
And if they catch you with them drugs, you ain't get 'em from us
It's yo' world, baby, I'm just getting the nut
And I appreciate you giving it up, ha
(Let me see)

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, when a rich nigga want you (Want you, baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya

That'll never work 'cause all she want is
All she want to do is get fucked good

[Chorus]
I been all around the world, every girl want a street nigga (aw, yeah)
100 bottles in the club, that's me nigga
Ya bitch looking at me, nigga, I'm 'bout to leave with her (aw, yeah)
Soon as I lit the blunt she said, "Can I smoke with ya?"
I said, "This shit ain't free"
She said, "I know all I need is one pull" (aw, yeah)
"I came to smoke with ya"
I said, "Okay babe, only this once, you know you owe me"
"Can I smoke with ya?"
I been all around the world, every girl want a street nigga (aw, yeah)
100 bottles in the club, that's me nigga
Ya bitch looking at me, nigga, I'm 'bout to leave with her (aw, yeah)
Soon as I lit the blunt she said, "Can I smoke with ya?"
I said, "This shit ain't free"
She said, "I know all I need is one pull" (aw, yeah)
"I came to smoke with ya"
I said, "Okay babe, only this once, you know you owe me"
"Can I smoke with ya?"

[Chorus]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
All of your rent paid, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
No matter where you are, you the shit, babe, when I love you

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm coming home to you, I'm getting off kinda early
I loosen my top, the thought of your thighs, I wanna get dirty
If I put it in, I might just hurt it
You gon' make me take the day off

[Pre-Chorus]
Must not know me, I can't hit it one time, gIrl, you know I gotta come back
'Cause you blow my mind, along with other things
Can we go round three? Don't waste this time, wasting time
Break that body down and do a slow whine just for me, 'cause I

[Chorus]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it (climb on top of me, ride, ride)
It's just gonna be me and you together (me and you together)
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe

Fuck what that bitch say, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
You know that you that bitch, babe, when I love you

[Verse 2]
Whatever you buy, it's okay
I see you trying on that dress, pick up them J's for me
Spend it all on you, all for you, let's go all the way
This girl gon' leave right now
You got me going crazy, girl, I'm out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Must not know me, I can't hit it one time, girl, you know I gotta come back
'Cause you blow my mind, along with other things
And can we go round three? Don’t waste this time, wasting time
Break that body down and do a slow wine just for me, 'cause I

[Chorus]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Pay for your rent, babe, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
You know that you the bitch, babe, when I love you

[Outro]
You gon' go one on one when I love you (One)
One on one, when I love you (One)
One on one, when I love you (One)
One on one, babe, one on one, babe, girl
One on one, when I love you (One)
One on one, when I love you (One)
One on one, when I love you, babe (One)
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Fuck what that bitch say, when I love you

[Verse]
There's gold at stake for Golden State
How much weight can King's shoulders take
When the odds ain't great some fold and break
While greats let the dreams of a ring motivate
Boys become men when postseasons begin
These lights shine brighter baby, sink or you swim
To those who got here by the skin of they teeth
The formula's the same now: win and repeat
Never sleep on a man that's expected to lose
With a chip on his shoulder and something to prove
The bottom's full of Wolves and they thirsty for blood
The mission is to catch somebody slipping above
"But numbers don't lie," I've heard 'em say it at times
"Cream rises to the top," is a favorite of mine
And the cream of this crop you'll admit is impressive
But to quote the boy Hov, "Gotta finish your breakfast"
And watch for the quiet ones, they bringin' the storm
Even with a man down, "The show must go on"
No time for crying, better pick up the slack
Cause ain't no guarantee that you gon' ever be back
Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Keep me in the backroads
Why should I stay down?
I keep tryin', tryin' my best now baby
To reach that solid ground

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' up the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Reach out for the wisdom
Touchin' it every day
I keep reachin' for my next step baby
I keep hopin' that I find a way
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' up the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Seekin' satisfaction
Doubt that I believe?
But don't try me try my faith now baby
I said daniel's stopped the mouths of beasts!

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Oh you know
You gotta come home
You know
You can't stay alone
You know
You gotta come home
You know
You can't stay alone
You know you're too cold
You gotta say it all
You're feeling on the low
I know that it’s fun
But what's the end goal?
You know that's you
You know that's you
You know that's you

[Post-Chorus: Laura Les]
Baby, you gotta have it all, you gotta think about it right now
What are we, what do you think about me right now?
You gotta have it all, you gotta think about it right now
What are we? Do you think about me, do you think about me?

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
Last night drunk, I said too much
Asked me what I want, then I threw up
You said it's okay, I smiled at your face
Now my face is going numb
Doing what I want, sayin' what I say
Asking me some shit I don't wanna say
Don't go, you know what I'm trying to say
Can we just hang? I'll say it that way
Another night drunk, said too much
Asked me what I want, then I threw up
Smiled at your face, said it's okay
Now my face is going numb

[Verse 1: Dewain Whitmore]
I hate to admit it, boy, but I need loving
But if it's gonna be this hard, I don't need nothing
Everything you say is like a crossword puzzle
I'm always tryna put it together

[Pre-Chorus: Dewain Whitmore]
I don't, I don't need that, no
I got my feet on the gas though
I don't need anyone slowing me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just don't know who to love
Don't know who to trust
My heart's been broke so many times
I would be a fool to love
Be a fool to love
'Cause I'm done with waiting now
I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I just need—
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I can't, can't
Now I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you (A fool), love you (Can't, can't)
Said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you (A fool), love you (Can't, can't)

[Verse 2: Dewain Whitmore]
Everything you put me through for no damn reason
Try to fix the problem when I say I'm leaving
I heard it before but I just don't believe it
I don't think you're playing for keeps

[Pre-Chorus: Dewain Whitmore]
I don't, I don't need that, no
I got my feet on the gas though
I don't need anyone slowing me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just don't know who to love
Don't know who to trust
My heart's been broke so many times
I would be a fool to love
Be a fool to love
'Cause I'm done with waiting now
I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I just need—
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I can't, can't
Now I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you (A fool), love you (Can't, can't)
Said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you (A fool), love you (Can't, can't)

[Intro]
Ghetto, uh, uh
Ghetto, ghetto (yeah)
Ghetto (uh) ghetto

[Verse 1]
Ghetto mythologies colonize my mind constantly
To shine sonically in the Chi, Divine Comedy
I vibe consciously to override suicide inside
Honestly 'cause they don't wanna honor me and honesty
Black king poetic with Nat King's aesthetic
Half-dream, half-machine where the black queens get naked
For a dollar from a scholar like me
Not at all bothered with what a sodomite see, flippant
A thousand grams get dissolved in the kitchen
Heart wrenchin', part played, took away from my ascension
Crooked ways brought from car lookaways from tooken Js
But it's too late for your prevention 'cause I'm playin' my position

[Chorus]
I'm the man now
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now
I'm the man, now

[Verse 2]
Uh, killer friends, dope dealers concealing sins
Sin and swim in my trunk like jumps in deeper ends
We the gems, your daughter, we'll teach her hymns
From the annals of crime channels that dismantle her wants for weaker men
Send 'em back, a livin', I'm feelin' trapped
We no religion but brimmin' with brilliant facts
So we map cast distorted role of a lady
With no control, let her go whole on a baby
I wanna see it all, never half asleep some niggas can't see the walls
'Cause of the masterpiece my data breach like hacker leaks
Delete the McAfees and slam the backdoors in back of me
Social engineer, peers stare at it, give a chat to me happily
Actually activated off accolades of my apogee
And act yakkity then deeply speak it back to me
Then move it further, we can have a junta or a jerga
I smurf it and spoof the server, reboot and produce a cursor

[Chorus]
I'm a man now
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now (ghetto, ghetto)
I'm the man, now

[Verse 3]
Deny the service and a little blue from the boycott
Advertise rum, space available on my toy box
But no sleepin' on me, dig deeper than reachin' shorties
Scheme for giant green, getting CREAM sweeter than bein' corny
Know the difference between bein' in love and bein' horny
Bein' hated, bein' human, bein' a teen but bein' forty
They like to get 'em young like I'm Brigham's son
Be more man and my attitude' no lad, I'd rather have a youth
Flag the OGs pullin' Benzos out
They make 'em put they pussies out like Fred Flintstone's house
Heart blacker than the back of Fred Flintstone mouth
Or maybe more like Baba Kwesi, take the TEMBO route
To be

[Chorus]
A man now
I'm the man, now
I'm the man, now
If you the man, let me see your fuckin' hands now
Not the man then keep your motherfuckin' hands down
Man now (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
I'm the man, now

[Outro]
From the ghetto, ohh
Qul a'uudhi bi rabbin naas
Malikin naas, Ilaahin naas
Min sharril wawaasil khannas
Alladhee yuwaswisu fee suduurin naas
Minal Jinnati wa naas
Ghetto
From the ghetto
Ghetto (ghetto, ghetto)
From the ghetto
Ghetto (ghetto, ghetto)
Not goin' down to the ghetto, the ghetto
When we gon' bring back God to the ghetto?
You're the man, now, yeah, yeah
You're the man, now
You are, the man now
You the man
You're the man, now (now, now)
Huh, whatcha lookin' at?
Huh, whatchu lookin at?
Huh, whatchu lookin at?

[Verse 1]
You were talkin' trash, we were tossin' bags
When I caught your name at a corn hole game
September Saturday in Rocky Top
On top of G10 parking lot
Said "Girl, where you sittin'? I got an extra ticket
It's right on the 50"

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Verse 2]
They sent out the Pride of the Southland band
And all I could think about was holdin' your hand
Was just gonna catch it on a couch TV
And last second scored a couple tickets for free
But baby I'd have paid anything to see

[Chorus]
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime

[Bridge]
Now every time the leaves start fallin' down
I get to thinkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
That 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
You had me by halftime
You had me by halftime

[Verse 1]
Whatcha know about thumping skeeters with your fingers
With a stringer full of keepers under thunderhead clouds?
Whatcha know about picking off a blackberry?
Little Cherry Skoal Dip make the swelling go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, girl, lucky for you I'm a two lane tour guide
Mmm, get your country boy heartbreaking certified

[Chorus]
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to "yaw" with a Southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back (if you go back)
And you'll be city girl, buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that (You and me)
Yeah, whatchu know about that? (Y-y-you and me)

[Verse 2]
Whatchu know about that Saturday summer
Heat deep creek creeping down around a bend
And whatchu know about taking off what you bought at the mall
Hang it all on a sycamore limb

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, we can get on out where the cowboy hats flow
Mmm, ay whatchu know about a hillbilly backstroke?

[Chorus]
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to "yaw" with a Southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back (if you go back)
And you'll be city girl, buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that

[Bridge]
Sippin' on shiners, diners, sugar pies
Bobbers and cane poles
Kissing in the fireflies
Bet you gonna smile when you get back home
And that Nitty Gritty song comes on on your phone
'Cause thats my ringtone, ha
(You and me)
You and me, yeah

[Chorus]
Let's order up a couple longnecks
Maybe take a two step or two
Teach you how to "yaw" with a southern drawl
Get you falling 'fore the night is through
And we'll park in it the boons
And catch a little moon tan
By the time you go back (if you go back)
And you'll be city girl, buzzin' over country boy loving
Tellin' everybody that you know whatchu know about that (You and me)
Yeah whatchu know about that? (You and me, Y-y-you and me)
Yeah whatchu know about that?

[Verse 1]
I'm a simple man, ain't no other way to say it
Lay my cards on the table, only way I play it
I got some draw in my y'all, they can't imitate it
Tough and rowdy reckless
Rough around the edges

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since you came around I've been
Thinking thoughts that I need to get out so I
I grabbed a pen and a napkin and I wrote this down

[Chorus]
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know it might sound a little elementary
Like a nursery rhyme straight up from the country
It won't pass for Shakespeare, girl I know it
But I'ma pour my heart out like a back porch poet

[Chorus]
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
Yeah, my tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue

Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you
Yes, I do

[Verse 1]
You say you need a couple credits 'fore they'll let you out of college
I bet you bought that beer with your Daddy's card
You're looking like you probably get a little tired of all this
Attention that you're getting when you go to the bar

[Pre-Chorus]
We can take a different route
I know you're from a different town
But you're here for now
So whatcha say we get on out and see where this night leads?

[Chorus]
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me, if I know me (Woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
This ain't some routine that I use every Friday
This ain't a one line, one night kiss and tell
But ever since I caught you looking over my way
All that I could do was tell myself

[Chorus]
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me (Woah, woah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
And I could just change my mind
And leave my number in your phone (Ooh, ooh)
And give you a kiss goodnight
And go home alone

[Chorus]
But if I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Bet I take you home and you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommate's home
Honey, when the sun come peeking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
'Cause I know me

[Verse 1]
We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Outro]
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again

[Verse 1]
I see you dancing with Mr. Handsome
He looks like he's a real romancer
I'm just hoping and I'm praying that one day I hear you saying
That you gon' give me that second chance and take me back
And we gon' roll through life in a Cadillac

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
No I ain't

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I'll buy you flowers, talk for hours
Write your name up on the water tower
Keep you covered up in diamonds
Make your smile light up just like 'em
I'm gon' "Yes ma'am" you "No ma'am" you, open up your door
And I'ma give you all my heart and a whole lot more

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time

[Bridge]
I'm gonna "Yes ma'am" you "No ma'am" you, open up your door
And I'ma give you all my heart and a whole lot more

[Chorus]
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time

[Verse 1]
That DJ on the side stage ain't played one song I like
It's all craft beer served in here, can't even get a cold Bud Light (It ain't right)
I see you sittin' over there barely sippin' your drink
Lookin' like you might need a little scenery change
Got a spot I've been hittin' since back in the day
What ya say we slip away and say the hell with this place?

[Chorus]
Go get a little gone girl on a black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl

[Verse 2]
Gone like that six pack we gonna tip back on my hood
Gone like our Levis,  gonna hang 'em on an old dogwood
Yeah the thought of you and me in the back 40
With the trees and the bees and the birds
Can't think of nothin' better but baby no pressure
Really all you gotta do is say the word

[Chorus]
We can get a little gone girl on a black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
'Til it's gone girl

[Bridge]
So baby let's roll, take a few backroad curves
Roll 'til we find a little heaven on Earth

[Chorus]
Let's get a little gone girl on a black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
Take a few backroad curves, yeah 'til it's gone girl
Find a little heaven on Earth, 'til it's gone girl

[Verse 1]
You say those city boys living in those high rise condos
Only left you feeling low
Those little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast
But never got you where you wanted to go
All I've ever owned is an old Chevy truck
Cuddled up, get you falling in love on the bench seat

[Chorus]
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my South side show
Whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
Jack and seven sipping, hoping that you're digging on me
Talking Tennessee

[Verse 2]
You say the street lights only ever let you see the skyline
It's been a long time
Since the Milky Way, Jupiter, and Venus took your breath away
Yeah like you're taking mine
What you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars
Catch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar

[Chorus]
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my South side show
Whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
Jack and seven sipping, hoping that you're digging on me
Talking Tennessee

[Bridge]
There I go letting my South side show
Whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
Jack and seven sipping, hoping that you're digging on me
Talking Tennessee

[Outro]
Talking Tennessee
Talking Tennessee
Well
You been talkin’, talkin’ to the people
Tryin’ to get them to go your way
Telling us, telling us not to worry
You say we won’t be led astray
We’re so tired of your signifying
How do we know, till it’s too late
Whether or not you’ve been lying?
Think about the mistakes you make
I believe, sir, that humanity’s at stake
You see, busin’, busin’ is just one issue

One Issue
What about the rest of it, mister?
Well
If you, if you got the plan
I said
If you’ve got the master plan
I got to vote for you
Ah yeah
I got to vote for you
‘Cause You’re the man I know, ah yeah!
Maybe what this country needs is a lady
Is a Lady for president
No, we don’t wanna hear no more lies
About
How you plan to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
This heavy taxation has got us all in this awful situation
Don’t give us no peace sign
Turn around
Rob the people blind
Economics
Money is all you’re interested in
Do you have a plan all the people can share in?
‘Cause if you’ve got the plan
I got to vote for you
Cause You’re the man. I know!
Jesus
People marching on Washington
Why not hear what they have to say?
Because the tables might turn against you
Set around Election Day
Demagogues and admitted minority haters should never be President, this time a lady
Will you, Will you stop the bombs
Right all the wrongs
This administration has done?
I know peace and freedom is the issue

Oh Lord!
Do you have a plan with you, mister?
‘Cause If you’ve got a plan
I said
You, You’ve got the master plan
Well I got to vote for you
Oh Lord I got to vote for you
‘Cause! You’re the man
Got to vote for you!

If you’re gonna take a stand
Got to vote for you. Gonna be the man?
What about the issues?
What about the young folk?
What about marijuana?
What about peace?
Peace in the land
Do you understand?
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, take a stand
Then I’ll vote for you
Think, you’re the man
Tell me something
Don’t run away
Tell me something
Gotta see you your face
I gotta vote for you
Think that you’re the man
Gotta to be strong
Whether you’re right or wrong
Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
And a-take me with you
Hey, I wanna leave here, oh oh

Mother Nature
Take the chains off me (please)
As long as I'm livin', livin'
Hey, I wanna be free, hey

Come on and let your sweet wine
Rush to my head
And make me feel fine

Let me stand naked in the sun
Hiding from no one
Hey, hey, hey

Mother Nature
Come on and do your thing
(I'm begging you, Mother)
I want to start feeling, hey
All those good things you can bring
Hey, hey
Oh oh, day in, day out, 9 to 5
Leaves me half alive
And I'm going nowhere
I can't live in this classic world
It's killing me
Can't you see
You're the only one to turn to

Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
But take me with you, with you
Hey, I wanna leave here

Mother Nature, I wanna leave here
Oh, Mother

Hop out the rubber stunning on jabronies
Nigga you know that you phony
Nigga you know you a clone
1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga

And let's celebrate the fact that I'm back killing everybody
Put it in, lemme get it, bottles in the air, we doing it bigger
Game over, bitch, 'cause I ain't playing with none of you niggas
See me stay in tune, that's why me and the streets is so connected (Huh)
From gotta get this dollar, to smashing niggas on they record
You gotta respect it, ain't nothing you can do to prevent it
Or defend it, embrace it gracefully as I bless it (Go)

You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (Bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (Bang)

Turn your radio up like you don't give a fuck
Turn the radio up, on your stereo (Ha, look)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'ma turn the radio up so I drown out all that shit you talking
Acting like a saint, bitch, you know that you ain't in New Orleans
Bottles of that Ace on your face, molly's got you rolling
Motivate you to put it on me like you Kelly Rowland
Feel it all in her gut, smack her butt, now her belly swollen
My balls got her pent up like I'm fuckin' bowling
Either pay me for this appearance or just stop promoting
My name Curry, wait, but I'ma keep going

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (Bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (Bang)
That's your girl, why you mad at me for? (Bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (Damn)
You can ride me like a rodeo, heehaw (Bang)
Move ya body up and down like a seesaw (Bang)
That's your girl, why you mad at me for? (Bang)
I never seen a ass like this before (Damn)

Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Chorus]
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

This is what you call a flip

Oh, what am I gonna do?

I think that you've changed things
Since i met you, I can't live without you

To share a love like ours
Takes more than nouns and verbs

You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol

[Verse 1]
I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dalai Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!

Too many times I swallowed my pride

I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive

Fly to D.R. on a weekday, eatin' ceviche
With like half of a mili' inside of my briefcase
A couple of freaks play
And they don't speak inglés
But the money is somethin' that they could comprende
And I got bread like I'm Green Day
(Get money)
I come around and their heads turn
Used to like bitches with hair permed
Now I like it "natural, actual, factual"
Naps and shit, bougie, still do ratchet shit
Not afraid to pass the clip
Before I make the ratchet spit, blaow!

[Chorus]
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
(Get money)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
(Get money)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money

[Refrain]
Too many times I swallowed my pride
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm

[Outro]
Get money
Get money

[Verse 1]
There's something about the way you walk (Walk)
And there's something 'bout the way you talk (Talk)
And I saw you sitting there on the shelf (Shelf)
I knew I have to had you for myself (Self)
I only met you yesterday, but as strange as it seems
You answered all my prayers
You're the girl of my dreams (That special one)
Oh, I can't deny (You are that special one)
The one that caught my eye

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
You are my special one, Lord knows, baby
Oh baby, ooh

Something about the way you look (Look)
To describe her, I'd have to write myself a book (Book)
Oh babe, ooh, something 'bout the things you do (Do)
Oh, that has won my confidence in you, girl (You)
Oh, mama told me, someday, someone would set my soul on fire
Now I'm burning up, burning up, woo, burning with desire

Woo, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, ain't nobody sweeter

That makes me know that my love is real
Oh, you're that special one
Sugar, sugar that special one

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hear no trouble talk
People telling me what they seen you do
Girl, we got understanding and I don't wanna ruin it
If I wanna find something wrong, I'll go catch you doing it, woo

[Chorus]
You got what I need baby (Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose you
(Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna lose you)
So I'm gon' give you respect and I want to protect
Our love (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna act so naive
When people tell me you gon' deceive me
You're the only one who's brought me peace and joy
What we share, Lord knows, I ain't about to destroy

[Chorus]
Oh, baby (Sugar, sugar, now)
I don't wanna lose you

So I'm gon' give you respect and I wanna protect

[Bridge]
Sugar, you possess all the things I been searching for
You're the only one I worship and I adore
What you got, baby, so many fellas are trying to find
Not gonna fix it so some other guy can beat my time

[Chorus]
(Ooh, sugar, sugar, now)
I don't wanna lose you
(Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna lose you)
So I'm gon' give you respect and I want to protect

Ooh (Give you respect, wanna protect)
Little girl (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Our love (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You deserve it, baby (Give you respect, gotta protect)
This love of ours, yeah, yeah (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Try it, you'll like it
What the world needs now
Is a little more love
Little more love
Little more love
Just a little more love

[Verse 1]
Can't be no love
When there's nothing but pain inside
Can't see no love
When you're looking through too much pride
Oh, peace, love, understanding
In the eye of the beholder
People are staying home
When they got chips on their shoulder
We must all work together
We must help one another

[Chorus]
Oh, people
Try it, you'll like it
What the world needs now's
Just a little more love
Little more love

[Verse 2]
You better watch that man
Standing there pointing the finger
Just like a bee, getting ready to sting ya
Health, wealth and freedom
It wouldn't be hard to find
How you gon' get it together
With chains around your mind?
We must all work together
Lord have mercy
We must all love one another

[Chorus]
Try it, oh, you'll like it, people
(What the world needs now is a little more love)
Try it, you'll like it
It's all up to you now
Well, whatcha gon' do?
True to life as a mirror
And the reflection is you, you, you, you, you, you

[Bridge]
Oh, try it (You'll like it)
What the world needs now
(Just a little more love)
Hey, hey

[Intro]
There's gonna be times, I know, girl
When the going's gonna get a little rough, child
There's gonna be times, I know, girl
When the going's gonna get a little tough

[Verse 1]
Oh, but if you and me, oh baby, got unity
Hey, girl, me for you and you for me
Just as long as we got that kind of love
We can make it, baby
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
Just as long as we got that kind of love
We can make it, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's gonna be times, I know, girl
When you might wanna just sit right down and cry
Hey, hey, hey, hey
But don't you let that bother you, girl
'Cause when you need me, girl
I'm gonna be standing right by your side

[Chorus]
'Cause we got love, so much love
Oh, we can make it, baby
Oh, girl, we got that kind of love
That all our friends admire
The kind I like to boast about
The kind that I can't live without

[Bridge]
Nothing's always gonna be like a distant dream
I'll be your realest friend when you need me, girl
So come on, girl, let's take the world
Come on now, let's do it, let's do it, woo
Come on now

[Chorus]
Oh, we got love
Oh, we can make it, baby
Oh, we got love, wonderful sweet love
And we can make it, baby
We can make it, baby
We can make it, baby
We can make it, baby
Oh, we can make it
Gonna make it, baby
Yeah, make it, baby
My love is growing

Oh, in my darkest hours
I want to see your face
Then I know, baby
That my love is growing

And it's growing, ah yeah
You make so happy, baby
You make me so secure
And all my troubles
I've only got to think of you
I do

Oh, baby, it's growing
My love is growing
Everyday, darling
My love is growing
Sugar, it's growing
It's growing
Oh, girl, don't ever leave me
Don't leave me in this way
I know I won't make it without you
Or live day to day
Oh, baby, baby
I want you to know
That I love you so
My love is growing
Sugar, it's growing
It's growing, ah baby

My love is growing
Keeps on growing
Oh, it's growing
Oh, it's growing
Growing
Baby, it's growing
My love is growing
Baby

Let's grow it
Oh, baby, my love is growing
Symphony
She's only known as symphony
Melody, yeah
Crept- crept into the soul of me
Symphony, yeah
She's sort of like a song, she moves along
In perfect rhyme, oh la la
Right now feel perfect time, baby
You and me to slip away, slip away
Let our song begin to play
Yeah baby

Make me the one, darling
Only one who know the bliss
Of knowing a kiss
All the love of symphony, symphony

Like violins, music begins
It starts to swell, then I can tell
That pretty soon we going to be in tune
Our hearts will be in perfect harmony
Symphony
Got my heart hit like a tender beat, "boom Boom"
When you want me, send for me, "cha cha, cha cha"
And I'll come and love you tenderly
Hey oh, I'll do the things girl
Oh making you feel that my love is for real for you
Symphony, symphony, oh
Do the thing makes you feel that I love you darling
I know the essence of your togetherness
Is so divine
Well, it sends an air of happiness to my soul
And my mind

I know the way your eyes caress me
The look of love on your face
Sends me to a new dimension
Keeps me spinning way out in space

Well, it's love, it's love, it's not my imagination
How else can I explain the phenomenon
What a sensation from this wonderful creation
Oh, baby, you're the music I hear

It's the sound of your voice
Darling, you're my rhapsody
My rhapsody

The essence of your togetherness
Really, really turns me on
Even in a crowd of people
You and me can really be alone
Oh, baby, we're so together, darling
If you only knew
I'd give my life for you

Oh, baby, it's love, it's love
It's not my imagination
How else can I explain the phenomenon
Of sensation from this wonderful creation?

You're the music I hear
It's the sound of your voice
You're my rhapsody
If you only knew
I'd give my life for you
What's going on?
Now, what's going on?
People, hurt and tired
Falling in love again

Now, what's going on?
People, now what's going on?
I wanna know right now what's going on
Telling you right now, what's going on

Lots of corruption in the government
Who can you trust?
Oh, understand
Oh, baby

You said you wouldn't mind being
What's that you say?
Now, what's going on
Tell me, baby
What's going on
Now, what's going on
What's going on
Going on now
Wanna know now
People getting tired
Want a little love and justice
Make you feel
Feel my love is real, sugar
Please tell me, lord
Now, what's going on

[Intro]:
A vote to you if you can
Pull the country through
You're the man

[Verse 1]:
You been talking, talking to the people
Trying to get 'em to go your way
Telling us not to worry
You say we won't be led astray
So blind from signifying
Your opponents, following 'em all with lies
Oh, think about the mistakes you made
I believe America's at stake
Busing, busing is an issue
Come on, lemme hear your plan, mister
'Cause, if you've got a plan
If you've got a master plan

[Chorus]:
I got to vote for you
I got to vote for you
You're the man

[Verse 2]:
Oh, we don't wanna hear no lies
No, how you plan to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
The nation's taxation
Is causing all of this inflation
Don't give us no peace sign
Then turn around
And rob the people blind
Economics is the issue
Come on, let me hear your plan, mister
'Cause if you've got a master plan

[Chorus]:
I got to vote for you
You're the man
Oh yeah

[Repeat x5]:
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land

[Verse 3]:
Hey, hey
People marching on Washington
Why not hear what they have to say?
Because the tables
Might just turn against you, brother
Set around election day
Politics and hypocrites
Is turning us all into lunatics
Can you take the guns from our sons
And right all the wrong
This administration's done
Peace and freedom are the issues
Come on, let me hear you plans, mister
'Cause if you've got the master plan
If you've got the master plan

[Chorus]:
I got to vote for you
I got to vote for you
You're the man

[Outro]:
Help the country
The colored folk
Equality
Unity
Stop them
Got to vote for you
Got to, got to, got to vote for you
Help the people
Save the land
Save the land

[Verse 1]
Sun is rising
Black is turning blue
Look out, buddy, Noah's calling
Jesus, man, what did you do?

[Verse 2]
Psychic terrorists
In the upper room
Left foot, right foot, that's the ticket
You'll be back on top real soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Whose bright idea was it to sharpen the knives?
Just twenty minutes 'fore the boat capsize
If you want an answer, it's anybody's guess
I'm treading water as I bleed to death
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
What's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

[Verse 3]
Your compositions
A start of every song
Find you waking in the morning
Always there to greet the dawn

[Verse 4]
Trouble sleeping
My alarm goes off
So you wanna hang out at the gallows?
Those guys get an early start

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whose bright idea was it to sharpen the knives?
Just twenty minutes 'fore the boat capsize
If you want an answer, it's anybody's guess
I'm treading water as I bleed to death
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
What's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?
Oh, oh what's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

[Verse 1]
I know a few ten-cent words
I can break out to keep up with her
But you can take what I know about love
And drown it in the sink

[Verse 2]
I know my way 'round a tune
Won't be a single dry eye in a room
But you can take what I know about you
And maybe fill a small balloon

[Chorus]
But I'm just dumb enough to try
To keep you in my life
For a little while longer
And I'm insane enough to think
I'm gonna get out with my skin
And start my life again

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I'm no stranger to the female form
Oh, I've been here a few times before
Oh, but you could have me anytime
Everything's cool, I'm great, it's fine

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'm just dumb enough to try
To keep you in my life
For a little while longer
And I'm insane enough to think
I'm gonna get out with my skin
And start my life again

[Verse 1]
Nothing surprises me much
And my hobbies include:
Laughing in the dark
Do you want to go to the farm?
Do you want to go to the park?
I'll get you ice cream if you give me your card
Nothing impresses me much
I've got a great attitude
And a map to the stars
I've got your number from that sign in the lawn
I also want to vanquish evil but my mojo is gone

[Interlude]
Ooh-hooh-ooh, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh
Ooh-hooh-ooh, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh
(I-, I-, I-)
Ooh-hooh-ooh, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh
Ooh-hooh-ooh, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh
(I want you)

[Verse 2]
Come on, I bet you know most of my friends
They're some real exclusive dudes
From just around the bend
They're playing demos
Oh, they're wearing Dries
I can escort you down the runway, I just joined the police
Just right now! So you wanna be a grifter like me?
Are you hearing impaired with your own URL?
I'm the second coming
Oh, I'm the last to know
I didn't get invited but I know where to go

[Outro]
Ooh-hooh-ooh, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh
Ooh-hooh-ooh, ooh-hooh-hooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
One more wasted morning
When I could be holding you
To my side, somebody stop this joyless joy ride
I'm feeling older than my thirty-five years

[Verse 2]
One more cryptic message
Thinking that I might end it
Oh god, you must have woken up
To me saying that it's all too much
I'll take it easy with the morbid stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, and honey, I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And honey, I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have so please don't die
Wherever you are tonight

[Verse 3]
All these pointless benders
With reptilian strangers
Oh my god, you're so naive
You'll leave this world in a drunken heave
Who'll make the arrangements, baby, them or me?

[Chorus]
Oh, and honey, I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And honey, I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have, you're all that I have
You're all that I have so please don't die
Wherever you are tonight

[Verse 1]
It's only been three weeks
And a bag of speed from Jamie the PhD
She comes by the front desk
To leave my transcript with her edits

[Chorus 1]
Cause I don't wanna leave the palace
At least that's what my true love calls it
Last night I wrote a poem
Man, I must have been in the poem zone
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll get a pet
Learn how to take care of somebody else
Maybe I'll name him Jeff
But I think it might defeat the purpose
Living on housekeeping and room service

[Chorus 2]
But I don't wanna leave the palace
Let's pay someone to move in here and fix this
Last night I texted your iPhone
And said I think I'm ready to come home
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm way in over my head

[Verse 1]
Like a pervert on a crowded bus
A glare of love bears down on us
Like a carcass left out in the heat
This love is bursting out of me

[Chorus]
Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that lasts forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, and how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?

[Verse 2]
Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
Like a constant twitching in my eye
This love of ours will never die

[Chorus]
Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that lasts forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, and how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?

[Verse 1: Father John Misty]
Another night on the straits
All bug-eyed and babbling
Out on the corner of 7th and A
I'm in the business of living
Yeah, that's something I'd say
All I need is a new friend
I'm only five blocks away

[Chorus: Father John Misty]
Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer

[Verse 2: Father John Misty]
Beware the man who has everything
Everything that he wants
You can spot him from a mile away
In his gold chain and only one pair of socks
I'm out here testing the maxim
That all good things have to stop
The bar closes at five
But the big man is just opening shop

[Chorus: Father John Misty & Weyes Blood]
Speak to me (Oh, speak to me)
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me? (Don't you remember me?)
I was God's favorite customer
But now I'm in trouble

[Outro: Father John Misty & Weyes Blood]
Speak to me (oh, speak to me)
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
I need some company (I need some company)
I swear, just one more night longer

[Verse 1]
What would it sound like if you were the songwriter
And you made your living off of me?
Would you detail your near-constant consternation
With the way my very presence makes your muses up and flee?

[Chorus 1]
Goodbye, little songbird, I can leave
Goodbye, my love, is there anything else you need?

[Verse 2]
What would it sound like if you were the songwriter
And you did your living around me?
Would you undress me repeatedly in public
To show how very noble and naked you can be?

[Chorus 2]
Goodbye, little songbird, now you're free
Don't forget I'm the only fan of yours
Who has the sense to ever leave you be
How could you do this to me?

[Outro]
What would it sound like if you were the songwriter
And loving me was your unsung masterpiece?
Sleepin' at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly til you swat 'em
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear ended
Pause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!
Highway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?
They say "you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it"
Well call me clueless cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star
Life is a course and I'm a shoot for Par
I'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back man I'll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money CMR, blood like a scar
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for "Flaw"

(Uh)
(Uh)
(Yup, yup, yup, yup)
It's like I have it all
But I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way, like nothings my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me nigga, than I hope you toss and turning
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask yo bitch she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doing with it
Keep opening ya grill, I'm barbecuing with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwing with it
Some say this game is a joke well I hope they get it
OK, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice I hope my son's choose wiser
And don't call me sir, call me survivor

(Uh)
(Yeah)
(Uh)
(And they go yup, yup, yup, yup)
(Uh)

Call me killer 'cause I make a killing
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call 'em siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribbling
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let 'em be, 'cause you know how that stinger feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track; train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing, or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth
And the "F" is for fuck yourself
(Uh)
(Yeah)

And I ain't doing nothin' but getting my share
Breathin' this air
And Mack's mom told me she gonna keep me in her prayers
So I'm feeling alright I'm tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip than I'm a meet ya there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer
I'm tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for fear

(Uh)

[Verse 1]
Samuel, I'm sorry that he sunk
His teeth into your back
I'm sure we'll find it too

Breathe out, so we can slow down
All the bleeding from your skin
And no one will die
No one will die
No one will die
No one will die
No one will die

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Bigger cities wonder 

[?]
I feel comfort when im in my own room

[?]

[?]
It's me
It's me
Ooh
No one will die

[Verse 2]
Samantha, I'm sorry that your brakes
Went out along a hill
I know your leg's been scarred

Stand still and let me rub
This alcohol on your legs
And then you won't cry
No one will cry
No one will cry

[Intro]
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it

[Verse 1]
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres

[Bridge]
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'...

[Refrain]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

[Verse 2]
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'

[Chorus]
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
Can't take it when you die
Uno dos

[Refrain]
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil’s pie

[Verse 1]
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore

[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

[Verse 2]
I'm a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others

[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all wrong, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right

[Verse]
Over here, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently
I didn't get it, but now I can see

[Outro]
That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out, that there's a way out
That there's a way out

[Verse 1]
Boom, shake, shatter in my bones
Yeah, you break me like a stone
Leave me alone

Oh baby, can't you understand
I don't wanna be your man
No

[Chorus]
All the screwy people, I won't hurt you like they did
All the screwy people, I won't hurt you like they did
All the screwy people, I won't hurt you like they did
All the screwy people, I won't hurt you like they did, oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, babe, when you go to sleep
I bet you'll wake up just the same
A piece of meat

Oh, baby, call me on the phone
Maybe I'll tell you a poem
It's about no one

[Chorus]
All the screwy people, baby, we're just like you said
All the screwy people, baby, we're just like you said
All the screwy people, baby, we're just like you said
All the screwy people, baby, we're just like you said

[Intro]
Burn One, Burn One
Chyeah, uh-huh
Zaytoven on the track, dawg
Gucci Mane La Flare
Exclusive, chicken talk

[Verse 1]
I'm like a rooster in a cartoon, I say I need a brick or two
Half an onion worth of extra, ask me who I gave it to
Raw basin' Willy let him vacuum up the Bentley Coupe
Light Air Ones, buy a brick, I just might front you two
Told her three to let me pay for them there's plenty more to move
Ten thousand dollars worth of 20s in my tennis shoe
Patriotic painted Bentley shorty, its red, white, and blue
Heavy cocaina shorty cake and the icy too
Quarter chicken, half a chicken, man it's like a slice or two
Half a pigeon, whole pigeon, man, that's like a pie or two
Never buy nothing from a nigga 'til he let you drop a deuce
Bentley Coupe on 22s, a hundred more and keep the roof

[Chorus]
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zay give a mic check
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zaytiggy on mic check

[Verse 2]
Gucci throwin' bricks like he using the backboard
Shorty wanted deuces so I charged 'em a stack for it
Got it by the bag, get a whole or a half for it
Sold ya, settle still, 'cause I give for they ask for it
Imported cocaine but I don't have a passport
Offset rims got me looking Dale Earnhardt
Blue and yellow Jacobs, same color my paint job
Always tote guaps 'cause I don't got a black card
The 6 is like the Carter and Gucci's the landlord
But junkies don't get shit unless the J pay for it
Shorty got an ass on her, so I paid for it
I'm ready to leave, but you know I'ma stay for it
Purple golden kush, always call 'em the Laker sacks
Blue and yellow color dro, call it the Pacers pack
Green and white mid, man, I call that the Celtics thrax
You say you the weed man but, bitch, where your bales at?

[Chorus]
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zay give a mic check
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zaytiggy on mic check

[Verse 3]
Got a Bart Simpson charm so they can eat my shorts
Next piece I'ma cop is the iced out fork
Cristal bottle way to pop my cork
I'm a Dirty South nigga, mama I eat pork
I put it on the saucer if lil' mama like to snort it
Gucci makes it rain whether weatherman report it
Ordered her a daiquiri, heavy on the liquids
Say she like seafood so I got her swordfish
Lobster tail and crab legs since she's on the bed bitch
Can I call you Dorothy? 'Cause you so far from Kansas
Handsome debonair, fellow got the mellow yellow bezel
Black rims on the Phantom, same color Dr. Pepper

[Chorus]
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talkin' brick
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
This is chicken talk, dawg, this is chicken talk
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zay give a mic check
Bowl, stove, water, soda, cola, fork, check
Crazy color Nike check, Zaytiggy on mic check

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I want?
Can't go out like no pussy
Can't let no nigga push me, I take a nigga cookies
I heard you got a truck with a hundred pounds in it
So I got my chopper with a hundred rounds in it
Damb, that's some real talk, fuck what your clique thought
Throwin up them Es, like ?
Why you ? up, damb you done come up
Millitary trained up, almost famous
Gucci got a sick flow, all he wear is rose gold
Tryna get a deal, but all I got was closed doors
Now I'm the CEO, Imma sing my damb self
Nigga out of line, Imma beat him with a ? belt
? with a hot, burn him with a broomstick
Go fuck his main bitch, for tryna talk shit
Gucci keep it gutter, man, all I do is hustle, man
Imma take your mama, man, pistol wip your brother, man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Drop it off before I make you come and drop it off
Take it off, before I have to make you come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make you come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to make you come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make you come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to make you come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make you come and drop it off

[Verse 2: Eva Trill]
Take it off, drop it off, before I got to break you off
Hollow points in my special, rollin with ?
So obvious you fake and floss, I prommis you goin take a loss
You die before you hit the top, you and whoever you brought
Niggas still think they're Pac, til them bullits clap their lungs
You auint talkin out bout them guns, when we start clappin them guns
Hangin niggas over the edge, ?
It's murder murder, nigga, be killed or kill yourself
Homicide, suicide, gennecide, you decide
Fuck that unified, have my money, you gon die, nigga
I hate to do it to you, but I do you, and your cuttie pie
Right when you reside, brought that paper, ain't no fake
Hard times, in these hard streets
Hard 9, you won't wanna meet
? I'm supposed to be my brother's keeper
Drop that money off, so we don't have to see ya

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Drop it off before I make you come and drop it off
Take it off, before I have to make you come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make you come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to make you come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make you come and drop it off
Take it off before I have to make you come and take it off
Drop it off before I have to make you come and drop it off

[Intro: Richard Pryor]
Lotta shit happens, like, being in show business
A lot of shit happens, like, like, I make a lot of money, you know
And I'm really happy about it
And I'm not bragging, I just wanna say something
I make a so—fuck, it's ridiculous
But wait, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hey, if my father was alive today, I would go home and say
"Dad, I wanna tell you how much money I made"
You know what he'd say? "You's a lying motherfucker
Joe Louis didn't make that much money
Come in here, get your ass out the house
Coming here with that bullshit," hah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Lord knows I need something to fill this void

[Interlude]
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn

[Chorus]
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro: kiLL edward]
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Keep on falling down
Yeah

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse: J. Cole]
Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)

[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]
Time will tell who is on my side

Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down

Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Gimme drink, gimme smoke
Get me high, let me float
I'm a cloud, comin' down
Put me down, gentle now
Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can't cope
If I die, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Bridge: kiLL edward]
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down
I know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times
Stuck in my ways so I keep on fallin' down
Keep on fallin' down, yeah

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Bridge: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know

Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Verse 1]
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

[Chorus]
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

[Bridge]
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

[Verse 2]
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

[Outro]
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind

[Chorus]
Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, yeah
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, feel me

[Refrain]
Niggas be talkin' so slick (ugh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Feel like I gotta say somethin'
Thought of you got my heart jumpin'
But I can't come up with nothin' (no)
But I can't come up with nothin'
I put it off for a day
I come back around your way
Searching for what I could say
That accurately could convey
The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you wit game
So many been sent to the curb
And I did not come here to play
And I did not come to observe
And I did not come here to play
But I did not come to observe
Feel me

[Refrain]

[Intro]
One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Verse]
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, "blaow, blaow!", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, "Don't forget me"
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through

[Chorus]
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

[Outro]
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world
K.O.D
Choose wisely!
Can someone please turn off my mind?
My thoughts are racing all the time
There is no reason or no rhyme
I'm trapped inside myself

A newborn baby has two primary modes of communication
Laughter, which says, "I love this"
Or crying, which says, "This frightens me, I'm in pain"
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

At the bottom of the hourglass
Lies sand that represents the past
In which all of my demons rest
I'm calling out for help

There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely

Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
Choose wisely, choose wisely, choose wisely
K-O-D

[Intro]
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
Beep

[Verse 1]
I never had the courage to tell you I adore you
I did it in a song, I was too afraid to call you
I know, I know, I'm sorry, I know I'm annoyin'
I just want your attention
Ever since I saw you, knew nothin' was important
Your gravity is too strong and it's fuckin' up my orbit
Contact avoided by the time I record this
I just want you to listen

[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay
No, I won't...

[Chorus]
'Cause it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
And it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)

[Verse 2]
They Black Flag we AF
We BF as AF
But they won't get that
That's that 20 Century Women reference
You so hard to get like intricate metaphors
Companies? I own four
But all I want is yours
Hit the 'plex and catch a band (ooh)
Sushi spot I recommend (ooh)
Float around hittin' wheelies, leg or engine-based, it all depends
Either one is cool to me
And you're way too cool for me
I'ma freeze to death tryna keep up
Thirsty I am, I may need three cups, what's up?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay

[Chorus]
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
And it's them rose tinted cheeks (cheeks, cheeks, cheeks, cheeks)
It's them rose tinted cheeks, uh

[Verse 3]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact, yeah
Speedin' down the 5 in my newest ride
You was kinda high, speakers mild high
Track 10 track 10, dirt bike afternoons
As long as pale skin's near, I didn't have to leave the room
Switch gears
Roamed around fell in love (fell in love)
Broke my leg, got stuck, what the fuck?
Hit my head, wait, I wish you would fall in too, I said
I wish you would fall in and snap them legs
Cause I'ma be stuck here until I'm dead and gone

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la, uh
La-la-la, la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Outro]
I remember when we first met
My eyes, like jeans too tight, I couldn't take 'em off you
You're precious metal I was a magnet just lookin'
I've been searching for somethin'
But didn't know what I was looking for
Then you popped and it became so clear
Like that water up north, so clear
Got me sayin'
Alright, alright
And truthfully now
I'm intimidated by your existence
Flustered because of your presence and
Your absence leaves me, leaves me in a state of confusion... I mean... (uh huh, alright)
I really can't function (ahhh)
La-la-la-la (uh-huh)
I can't explain it (uh-huh)
I'm aware enough to know this is just a temporary pool of emotion, shit (uh-huh, alright)
But since I'm here, I might as well drown, so
Please don't save me (uh-huh)
Ha ha ha, woo!
Yeah, alright (uh huh, alright)

[Verse 1]
It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, "Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
But he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with me, baby, was some kind of hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
I said nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse]
If you could put your eyesight through my eye view
Swear you'd see it shorter than a shorty who's 5"2'
High cool palms through this paper I write through
Bout that "Real Love" that a Mary J. Blige do
I do things for shorties who's eyes blue
But her light skin red like Piru
And damn, I'm feeling like a plane
I'm just looking for a air-head shorty to fly through
And I sky through whips like a crash dummy
You cats funny, this rapping is my dad sonny
Lost the mother years back, don't ask money
Niggas who got religious will still blast for me
I'm back like fiends for the drug money
You dumb funny fuckers fronting like thugs buddy
Anyone with a flag can be a blood, but he won't be a blood when it comes to the sun dummy
Asking women, "Why your man counting ones honey?"
Without Wayne, he's still dealing with young money
And I been looking for a girl, so you can take three and lose two and still wouldn't be the one for me
I never wished for niggas to get it intertwined
The money 360°, even sitting in a line
I realize none of these niggas is friends of mine
Mel Gibson ain't the only nigga catching signs
You gotta understand I'm in a different mind
I'm Vince Carter x2, I'm in a different prime
I got my fork and my knife like it's dinner time
Taking niggas greens like trees in the winter time
I feel lost with this pen of mine
I'm just talking, I ain't even begin to rhyme
I'm burning up rappers like 

[?]
Like a pimp at a strip club, you can get behind
Feel your mind change, in this diaphram
It's all mind games, It's part of the diagram
And I sit back and watch time change
My frame cool in a room full of five lames
Mr. Nine chain wearing round my neck piece
SB fans in the winter with the fresh fleece
I'm X streets, 

[?] best be
In and out the slot like a USB
Crew freshly dressed 

[?]
Watch your M-A-N-V-M-E
But I can bring that fly shit right back
Make a broad say I'm bad like Mike Jack
Type of rappers wanna lie while I write facts
Sleeping on niggas, PJs and a night cap
You see, I'm cold as an ice rack
But I'm fresh out the mouth like a nice jab
I heard your pipe rap, Family Guy
I ain't sharp, one shot your brain marrow fly
But I can burn you mans alive
You faker than a human disguise
Just take it how two mans collide
I shine, I can take the sun from the South and leave Houston deprived
But, Houston, we got a P-R-oblem
Whether you are Batman or Robin

[?] in a room, a bafoon or a goon or a goblin
You are nothing but a joker in the city of Gotham
I feel I was tossed in this mix off
Shit got me puzzled like a jigsaw, shit, boy
We living it all like it's pish posh
But I'm feeling like a block, like Chris Bosh
To see succession or beat depression and leave recession
I got devilish style, I need to see the Reverend
I need a blessing to leave a lesson, to key in testing
'Cause I'm professional, born in a seminal
If I'm the envelope, you niggas the centerfold
I'm in heaven still tryna dodge the men below
I'm telling every girl that we can't elope
States boy getting peeled like antelope
And we ain't on the same level, the same stage
Still Fly like Drake, but we ain't on the same page
As far as the future sees
Welcome to the future, T.O

[Outro]
Welcome to the mixtape

[Intro]
I gotta get into my, uhh
Story-telling state
It's like

[Verse 1]
Ayo, what happened last summer
It started with a text message saying
"Hey man, my name is Raven and we exchanged numbers
Sometime last night around the Government club"
Now I'm sittin 'here wondering "what?", cause I don't 'member that
But I sat back and played along with her
I logged on my phone, seen her face on Twitter
The voice in my brain saying "Lanez go on get her"
So I'm thinking with all that switching
Looking at my phone, no call back digits
Matter of fact, the phone call restricted
She won't come straight, so I'm all offended
But I let it down
Cause just cause lil mama call block didn't mean we couldn't mess around
So I kept on texting, but I shouldn't love her
And by now she had me open like a book cover
I mean shorty knew everything about me
She my ray of sunshine when it's cloudy
It's like shorty my 3-1 without 3
And then she questioned like "Do you heave a girlfriend?"
I said "nah, I'm as single as first head"
And even though I know I'm lying my pants off
Shorty too special just to give up the chance dawg
And I never seen Raven in person
But the pictures that she sent me are the whirlwind
And I would change my girlfriend for her sting
So I text her the question "Would you be mine?"
And then I sat back waiting for a reply
And then she text me
See I'm gon' show a lil' something that's gon blow through your sweet mind
She said "Don't get me wrong, cause I ain't player hatin'
But it's your girlfriend nigga, I was playing Raven
The whole time it was me on the phone
Well I know that you ain't faithful, Imma leave you alone
So uhh, to end it off nigga here is my one note
The dream love me and you had is done for
Now this is how I lost a good girl to a dumb phone

[Outro: Voicemail]
You have no messages

Yea, If ya'll don't want it, don't get involved

[?] season

Yeah
Uh huh

You already know who it is I shouldn't have even said that

But I guess when you fly as me you 100,000 feet in the air you don't really see population
Yeah

[Verse]
Look
I got 'em open like a fresh pair of eyelids
And yeah I'm on my fly shit and I could blow ya mind quick
Call me the sidekick
Chillin' on a island with five chicks small like a hybrid
Ball like Mike did and now these niggas hatin' every idea
This '09 year y'all gon cry tears
If famous wear a shirt that say "I rap" you should wear a shirt that says "I fear"
I feel
I scare rappers like a motherfucking virus
Her head up in the cloud and I'm the motherfucking pilot
And you ain't getting the same green I get
I mean I get so much green it's like I'm Irish
High glis' on my wrist and you can see the camera shoot
The CD gettin' spins it's Mr. Crash Bandicoot
The 

[?] like damn the goose
You don't want a band to do
Then yeah I got a plan and your man is what you plan to lose
Yup
Yeah I swear I fucking does it

Trey Songz ain't long I'm the mortherfucking man
Catch me in the cut I throw a motherfucking grand
Do 'em like 

[?] and throw it for the cam
I'm just tryna make you niggas understand
I got goons that'll make you niggas do the running man

[Chorus]
Baby I ain't never need it
Couple kickass Lamborghinis
Something fly up on my feet (I go hard)
Ladies see me when you see me
On the CD or a TV
I'm a fly, gassed nigga (I go hard)
And when I climb up down the cove

You could say I'm in the wrong but I'ma go hard until I'm gone motherfucker (I go hard)

[Bridge]

For the cats who?

It's lil' nigga that you thought was so lame

Yeah
And when I go insane, I do a bitch pinky and catch a lotta brain

And clothes expose like the Oprah Show

[Chorus]
Baby I ain't never need it
Couple kickass Lamborghinis
Something fly up on my feet (I go hard)
Ladies see me when you see me
On the CD or a TV
I'm a fly, gassed nigga (I go hard)

It's when them lights get lower
Liquor get on it and them visions get slower
Chickens get 

[?] and women they wanna show up
Any damn lady in the spots got a aura
Hold I'm fucking this ho and it's so nuts
Lookin' at the women my head spinning like donuts
Like cold cuts the way these chickens is swole up
I rose up, white Nikes and low cuts
Whoa, what
I can't even hear that
Chillin' off the shots you can show me where the bear at
I stare catch ladies say that he a weird cat
Swinging with them 

[?] you can show me where the glare at
All these islands say icons mixed with my diamonds I can't even drive home
Give the keys to my mans up front 'cause he just tryna get a milli like I'm Bangladesh
And yes

[Chorus]
And when them lights get low
You could catch 'em in the cut around the corner past 3
I was saying Henny on the shots but the Demi and the Remy on the rocks
Getting tipsy off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor

[Verse 2]
I see mami, she lean on me that Lamborghini
See me and see me she see me treat me that greeny kiwi
Peaches and creamy I see that she been eatin' her Wheaties
In 

[?] she be bikini reading my CD

Hallucinating off this frostberry fusion
This new music duck low and move it
Touch flow then lose it
Dumb down like

More boss than a new bitch
Shawty goin' low got me feeling so foolish
Get it, I get fly in my new kicks
Spitting like I'm toothless, look better than two tits
Now whose chick is that one?
'Cause damn son, gotta get up out it then spit up on it like cat guns
'Cause that one could be the one
Maybe I'm just tipsy of the licky forget it
Never mind one

[Chorus]
And when them lights get low
You could catch 'em in the cut around the corner past 3
I was saying Henny on the shots but the Demi and the Remy on the rocks
Getting tipsy off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor
Off the liquor

[Intro]

[Verse 1: RUSSELL]
You can catch me in an orange bandanna with a swagger elite
In a normal whip, sittin in the passenger seat
And maybe you can roll with me, cruisin down the whole city
So pretty, just chillin and bumpin old Biggie
With my boy, got his G2, 

[?]
Drove around the city's from T.O to Mississiauga
We never look back, we face the road
Just a couple young teens with no place to go
I took the transit but soon I got enough after
I hated paying 3 dollars for a bus transfer
So I would sit up in a whip with my dude
And tell em, when I'm famous, Imma get him a new
Clean whip to cruise the streets, in that, I'd be a live threat
But he'd be up under the wheel, cause I don't drive yet
Talkin bout the future, when I'm blown up and that
So I can go and turn that lil' tiny whip to a Phantom

[Chorus: RUSSELL]
We just ride, cops see under the dash
Throgh your hand back, I prommised the rest
We just ride, know we do it and run it
Just chill on the road, while music be bumpin

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
And you can catch me in my Ralph Laurens, so look out for me, spot me by the balcony
Rather be on my different ish, louder than your little sister is
Mister Mister take your little sister from her innocents
Yeah, I swear I'm feelin bigger than ever
Since I've been thinkin propellers
Make a fella fly, like damn, man, I get hella high
I be higher than an addict in the sky
My cool fool's super cool fools shoes on
Blue armored whip crush like croutons
My whole crew arms, I think I might do time
We used to skateboard, and matter a fact, we hated cars
I laugh about it cause I'm older now
And now them windows getting colder and skateboards don't hold you down
Be what I be, I'm layed back gettin them aged racks
I'm famous, Maybacks in my lane, you feel me
Tory!

[Chorus: RUSSELL]
We just ride, cops see under the dash
Throgh your hand back, I prommised the rest
We just ride, know we do it and run it
Just chill on the road, while music be bumpin

[Intro]
Haha, uh
Yeah
Nah, I mean I gotta keep it 100 percent real on this song
Sometimes I just wanna get away from everything, you know what I mean?
Think I need a vacation or somethin', uh

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning, life has got a nigga stressed out (Stressed out), stressed out
From the living room I hear my father telling, yelling, "Get out of this house" (Woah-oh)
He tells me, "Son, you need a J-O-B"
And then I say, "Dad, man, that ain't for me"
And really I know he ain't havin' that
And says you're gonna need money to fill your habitat
Look in his eyes, I see deep stressin'
Plus, my mother died and that's a depression
On top of that, here comes the weed session

[Chorus]
So I smoke and get high
And sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Every day I need a getaway, getaway
(I gotta get away, I just gotta get away)
And I just gotta get away, get away

[Verse 2]
My teacher says I'm kicked out
So I ain't doin' shit now
And plus, I just caught a case
Sometimes I feel my future's bein' thrown away
Out the door without a pause
I'm outta options
And watchin' all the kids graduate
While I'm sittin' in class, I'm in a angry state
My state of mind, I'm wastin' time
I feel like I ain't even close like it's a waitin' line
I just wanna skip but people tell me wait in line

[Chorus]
So I smoke and get high
And sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Every day I need a getaway, getaway

[Verse 3]
My new girl is trippin' out
Because I'm always dippin' out
Callin' my phone like, "You know what this shit's about"
And I say "Easy, that's some shit you could forget about"
But she don't listen, she keep on bitchin'
And I think, think, is it all worth it?
'Cause baby girl know I'ma be a star
So she can't leave me now, she believe that I'm creepin' dog
I try to tell her I ain't doin' that
But she don't listen, she just listen to her stupid friends
And then she goes, I hang up the phone
Can't deal wit' it, she can't

[Chorus]
I just smoke and get high
And sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Sometimes I wanna getaway, getaway
Every day I need a getaway, getaway
(I gotta get away, I just gotta get away)
And I just gotta get away, get away

[Intro]
I'ma show you how to do this, son
Hahaha
It's what it is

I got us, baby
They gon' have to sign us real soon right?
Brooks what up? Montree what up?
Real City TV, ha, uh

[Verse]
Them trap niggas can't stop me, I'm on top of the globe
And my writtens on top of the stove, I stay on top of the floor
Shots hot, ring the top of your dome
How the fast paced niggas can't copy the flow?
Though I carry the city on my backbone
Whenever I'm in it, the kids like that's home
I may be youngin but sonnin', yeah the cash grown
See me, savor the moment like the last moan, uh
And I ain't loafed and I been waitin'
I stacks money to the ceiling, feelin' impatient
This ain't tag but I gettin' what you been chasin'
Your chain fake, you see the foil and tin plating
Can't get none of the women that I been dated
I could take all of your women, get 'em invaded
Fuck wit' Benjamins, nigga, you gettin' 10 faces
Got the haters red and yellow like Timb laces
You got it wrong if you tryn' take me out
Count rip a track if you tore your girl weave out
What up Sess? Yes, what up B?
They can't shut up me
They like what up T? Oh
Or is I?
Haters can't see me, I am too far inside
Came in the game and niggas was like wizzah
Y'all can't soar me out, y'all niggas no Star Wars jedis
Bet I carry the game, I'm the scariest thing
And if I ever get a dame, she be married to flame, damn
Let me give you my thyroid
I'm so big, it's like my name's on steroids
Therefore, I don't wanna hear boys
Drop tracks all year, that's all year noise
And if it be mister Drake at the top, nigga
Guard your rank, I'm comin' for your spot, nigga
Friendly fire, whatever, I'm a hot nigga
Lookin' for a TDot chick that's got a fly figure
Filet getter, I said I'm a yay spitter
'Cause Lanez can take your chick and plant DNA in her
Yeah, and that's that
Cats is ass lacks, facts
Nah, niggas is shittin' like add lax, uh
Fuck a plaque, man, give me my shine
I need blocks, nigga, TDot city is mine

[Outro]
Nigga, nigga
I could make four more mixtapes off memory, nigga
Y'all ain't never gon' be better than me
I'ma do this 'til I'm 80, nigga
Words of a wise man, uh
And y'all niggas know what it is
You see, it's elimination time
All the real niggas stay and the fake niggas go, you dig?
This the flow that ended your career, nigga, you know what it is
Uh
I'm aimin' for the top, boy
N-Rimes, I see you, Freddy Fame what up?
All the niggas I fuck with, already know they fuckin' with me so I ain't gotta worry about that
Look out for my nigga Mo Green, free my brother Sos
Brooks what up? Montree
Real City TV what's good, baby?
I feel nice
And I'ma end it on that one, holla

[Intro]
Uh
Well, basically I'm doin' this for my white girls (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
I mean it got that old school feel to it so I'ma go old school

[Verse 1]
Shawty like my 9 to 5, she my dine for nine
And keep me flyer than a Honda ride, I'm like (Word)
Just like that Honda ride, I might swerve
But it seem all the ice on my Nikes is iceberg
I like my light, real tight girlfriend with a white girl that like girls
Type that and give me my night swirl
I called her in the bed like how you finna do that?
You my next diva, breath sweeter than Similac
Wit' your green eyes, niggas spot out your mean thighs
Hit the scene like we could chill in the three five
If you wanna bring Donna, we'll smoke the marijuana, it's on
Throw some rake up so that grown shit don't
I'm a new cat bringin' that old school back
These broads get cancelled like Nino in New Jack
For really, you gotta feel me
I'm illy as Ray Nance, it's Lanez, bitch
And girl, tell me what's your name, ain't that

[Chorus]
Caucasian girls all over me
Came and you changed my world
And you loved someone
That's my caucasian girl
She came and she changed my world
With a love so real

I know I like my all Asians, black chicks and caucasians
And Latinas nothin' less than divine
Butter pecan, Puerto Ricans
Like that say, "Ay, mira"
Then I beat it out the freezer
I'm fresh, nigga
You feel it in your chest, nigga
Vanilla chicks is the best
Gets my dick in duress
I'm on some fly shit
Drivin' two in a nine whip
If you don't like me, nigga, then hop off of my (Dick)
I tell 'em just like that
Can't even stare, man, these motherfuckers just might rat, right
Tan line, listen to Frank White, hit the bank tight
You gon' show me the plan (Right?)
Red Bree, never wear your hair in weave
But I got a lotta dollars, what appears to be on
It ain't I time I ain't pickin' the game
Look at the bigger picture, baby, I'll miss ya, it's Lanez, holla

[Chorus]
Caucasian girls all over me
Came and you changed my world
And you loved someone
That's my caucasian girl
She came and she changed my world
With a love so real

[Verse 2]
I'm lookin' for miss Library
You're stirrin' the high berry
And ice and nine cherries
And lightin' the nine scary
I might get high very 'cause really, I'm low do
Hit the photo, baby, just wait 'til that door close
Back in '92 when I was playin' it roughly
The earth's got burst so it's negative puppy, uh
And schoolgirls used to call me ugly
Made it to the big leagues and they all wanna fuck me
Around 1 AM we was at the club
1:15 showed your boy some love
Around 3 AM I took her back to the house
She say she wanna lay down, I threw her ass on the couch
Now it's 4 AM, she was feelin' the kid
Around 4:03 now I'm dickin' her ribs
Around 5 AM, started lippin' her mouth
About 5:09 I was kickin' her out
Yo, big money, sonny thinkin' that shit's funny
I get in your rib, honey, like somethin' you did funny, gotta love me
If you don't then I don't know better
It's awkward like the coat without the rose gold sweater, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Caucasian girls all over me
Came and you changed my world
And you loved someone
That's my caucasian girl
She came and she changed my world
With a love so real

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Uh, yeah

But you guys gotta understand is that, uh
I'm the motherfuckin' man
And I do what the fuck I wanna do

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie (Nah, I'm dead serious, a'ight there it go)
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie (Yeah)

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Look, my name is Lanez, I'm fly as fuck
I'm mean I'm flyer than anybody flying up
I ain't got no swagger up, but I got my dagger tucked
Catch a nigga with the .9 nine times, when the skyline shine yo' time is up
I'm back, nigga, do you know what that is?
That mean that my swag is much sharper than any cactus is
I got some actresses, couple of mattresses
So if you wanna get it crackin' we'll get back to biz
Niggas can never see me, I am all around the globe
Got some women in bikinis that I picked up at a show
And much a teenyboppers see me magazinin' so they blow me like Katrina or a smoker blowin' trees out of his nose
Know T.I.P. is where I be, you P.I.E., that's if you hatin'
Thinkin' I get phony, homie must got me mistaken
Superman cape, yeah, I'm apin' like bathing
On a skyscraper, chest beatin' and I'm screaming

[Chorus: Santigold & Tory Lanez]
I got to be unstoppable (Hahahaha, uh)
I got to be unstoppable (Aha, aha)
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie (It's check)
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie (Turn the lights low)
I got to be unstoppable (I mean)
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
(Aha, it's the part where I talk a lot of shit)
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Look, yo' name is hater, my name is Lanez
I come through and I take your dame
Nah, I'm joking, hahaha
I ain't even freestyling
You know what I mean? Aha
Understand the T.L 2 T.O mixtape's coming out
This summer, yeah
And y'all niggas talkin' shit behind your lil' computer screens, kill yourself
Yeah, I'd like to tell you about a dream I had about two monkeys
Huh, and I was one of 'em
And in this dream my name was Ug and my monkey friend's name was Mo
I guess that's why they call us "Ug-Mo"
Mo was goofin' around on the piano and I was goofin' around on my harmonica
And we were playing a little tune
And so, we decided to call this tune "Monkey Talk"

Come on, Mo, show the people that you can play, come on!

Monkey talk

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

We had a swingin' conversation going

That's monkey talk, alright, alright, monkey talk, yeah
Who's hairstyles are out of this world
Whether it's straight or bu'font or it's curled?
My baby my baby my baby ... hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty Baby

Hair soft like a baby lamb and I love to run my fingers through it
I hope she digs me the way I am, but if I have to change
You know I'm gonna do it for my baby
(I'm gonna do it for my baby)

Personality contains more gold
Than any bank in this world could hold
My baby, my baby, my baby, hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty Baby

Enough gold in her personality to set Fort Knox to shame
This golden girl belongs to me
Let nobody try to stake his claim
(Stake his claim on my baby)

(My baby) she's cute as can be (my baby)
This girl's got a hold on me
(My baby) Has a kiss so sweet, it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete
Oh yeah, she's my baby
Oh yeah, she's my baby
And I love her so
Yeah, I love my baby so

(My baby) She's cute as can be
(My baby) The girl's got a hold on me
(My baby) Has a kiss so sweet, it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete

Who has my mind in a kind of a haze?
Who has me walkin' around in a daze?
My baby, my baby, my baby, hey hey hey
My baby, baby, pretty baby

She gives me a feeling I can't explain
She sets my soul on fire
But I don't feel hurt and I don't feel pain
All I feel is a strong desire for my baby
(Strong desire for my baby)

Oh yeah, my baby, got personality to satisfy me
Ooh baby, that's my baby, my baby, my baby

[Verse 1]
If I find the end of a rainbow
And if I find that big pot of gold
I'm going to give it all to you
What more could I do?

[Verse 2]
If I had the lamp of Aladdin
I'd tell the genie just what to do
To take all the treasures in the whole wide world
And give them all to you
And I love you because

[Bridge]
When I'm mad sometimes, and you know I am wrong
Your understandings help me to be strong
Thank you, I said thank you
For all the things you taught me
Blessings you brought me

[Verse 3]
When I lead the stairway to heaven
I'll be so proud you showed me the way
I'll be so proud I have a mother like you
To love me all the way through

[Outro]
All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way
I'll be so glad I have a mother like you
To love me all the way through
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
I'll be so glad I have a mother like you
To love me all the way through
Angel, a pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel

Wish you knew just how I felt about you
Wish you felt the same way as I do
I can bring you love if you just open up your heart
Little girl, I'm so in love with you

If you ever tell me that you love me
If you ever show me that you care
I will be so proud to have you standing by my side
Little girl, I'm so in love with you

We'll be so happy together
We'll build a heaven of our own
And darling, if you just play your part
And let me steal your heart
I know I'll have your love forever

Angel, for your love I've been praying
Hoping someday you will look my way
I can make you mine if you just open up your eyes
Little girl, I'm so in love with you
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
A pretty little angel
Oh my
A pretty little angel
My, my, my
A pretty little angel
trend is always late

when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.

You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.

Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.

I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.

You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.

just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.

in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner

everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to "the simulation".  Parents are our first acting coaches.

oh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.

me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.
Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.

There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.

too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update.

Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️

I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like "this person stole this from me" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂

let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.

What once was lost, is found

[Verse 1]
My heart is a wasteland
My soul is a ghost town
This bed is sinking sand
And we're both going down
Your words are like arrows
They're aimed at the core of all my doubt
And the battle since the day my heart fell out

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I undo every wrong
If I promise I'll be strong?

[Chorus]
Angels cry, throw the halos from the sky
Angels fall, from heaven
Angels sigh, make the sun refuse to shine
Angels fall, from heaven

[Post-Chorus]
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)

[Verse 2]
My mind is a war zone
The silence hits harder than grenades
I never meant to put a noose around your face
Our beautiful kingdom, once was a paradise we reigned
You took my crown, I brought you down
We're both to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I undo every wrong
If I promise to be strong?

[Chorus]
Angels cry, throw the halos from the sky
Angels fall, from heaven
Angels sigh, make the sun refuse to shine
Angels fall, from heaven

[Post-Chorus]
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)
When we fall out of love (Love, love, love)

[Outro]
(Angels cry, angels sigh, angels die, angels die)
(You're my angel, you're my angel)

[Verse 1]
I tried to change but I couldn't help myself
I am to blame, I used to be someone else
No one got through, nothing came inside the gate
You made me feel when my heart was set on hate

[Pre-Chorus]
I convinced myself that I was invincible
But I didn't know that feelings can lie too
You exposed my deepest wound, but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

[Chorus]
Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl

[Verse 2]
You were so good at pretending that you care
I was alone, even with you standing there
You made me doubt everyone that cared for me
I shut them out so that you'd be all I see

[Pre-Chorus]
I convinced myself that I was invincible
But I didn't know that feelings can lie too
You exposed my deepest wound, but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

[Chorus]
Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl
Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl

[Verse 1]
This isn't what it seems
Feels like I'm living inside a dream
But I'm just dancing
Dancing with myself
You're from a different time
And I know that you can read my mind
But I'm still dancing
Dancing with myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'll be dancing with this vision
I've made my decision
Won’t let you go
And my favorite part is left inside my heart
Holding you close
Because your energy is still a part of me
You know I love you the most
I'm not ashamed to say

[Chorus]
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you

[Verse 2]
I feel your phantom touch
It's a pleasure, I need so much
Let's go dancing
Dancing with myself
Heaven's too far away
And my desire will make you stay
I'll keep on dancing
Dancing with myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'll be dancing with this vision
I've made my decision
Won’t let you go
And my favorite part is left inside my heart
Holding you close
Because your energy is still a part of me
You know I love you the most
I'm not ashamed to say

[Chorus]
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go, let you go
I'll never let you go

[Verse 1]
Come, come into my arms
Don't refuse me, the world will fall apart
If you could see, see into my eyes
You'd be with me, in this paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna live for tomorrow
Let's live tonight like it is the last

[Chorus]
Can you love me like the world is ending?
Hold me like it's Armageddon
Don't stop 'cause nothing lasts forever (Forever)
You can save me, never let me go
And make me indestructible
Nothing lasts forever (Forever)

[Verse 2]
Take, take me to the stars
Universal love is what we are
Trust me, put your hand in mine
I'll be with you 'til the end of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna live for tomorrow
Let's live tonight like it is the last

[Chorus]
Can you love me like the world is ending?
Hold me like it's Armageddon
Don't stop 'cause nothing lasts forever (Forever)
You can save me, never let me go
And make me indestructible
Nothing lasts forever (Forever)

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Can you love me like the world is ending?
Hold me like it's Armageddon
Don't stop 'cause nothing lasts forever (Forever)
You can save me, never let me go
And make me indestructible
Nothing lasts forever (Forever)

[Verse 1]
No one loves you more than me
Baby, we got history
Let's move forward, don't look back
I'll make up for what you lack

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me calling?
Can't you see I'm falling?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'

[Post-Chorus]
Satisfy ya, entertain ya
Light your fire, that's my nature

Baby let's not hesitate
I'd like to negociate
I can make your dreams come true
Here is what you gotta do

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me calling?
Can't you see I'm falling?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'

[Bridge]
Let me ask you something
If I speak my mind
You think you're ready to hear it
Okay come with me

[Verse 3]
Don't close the door
Cause I love you more
Stay here with me
Where you're supposed to be
When we're together
It's thunder and lightning
The way I love you is frightening
It mock your reason, let your play
Just watch out for what you say
If we just communicate
Everything will be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me calling?
Can't you see I'm falling?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'
Take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back all my luvin'

[Post-Chorus]
Satisfy ya, entertain ya
Light your fire, that's my nature
I want to satisfy ya, entertain ya
Light your fire, that's my nature
You heard it, that's my nature
Take it back

[Outro]
I'm calling for you, baby
I'm calling, guess I'm crazy
I'm falling for you, baby
I'm falling, guess I'm crazy
I'm calling for you, baby
I'm calling, guess I'm crazy
I'm falling for you, baby
I'm falling, guess I'm crazy

[Chorus]
Boy, let's sweat and I'll work your body, body

All night
When I call the play, you can run it, run it
I love it, love it
All night

[Verse 1]
All stars go far
I let you in my office like a point guard
Pose up, close up
You can make the finals if you play hard

[Pre-Chorus]
You can be my baller, baby
Let the game begin
I can be your coach and maybe teach you how to win

[Chorus]
Boy, let's sweat and I'll work your body, body

Make the crowd go wild
Fast, break, back door
Put it up in style

Half time, you're mine
Meet you at my bleachers, kissing courtside
Bench you, send you
Straight into the locker room to quench you

[Chorus]
Boy, let's sweat and I'll work your body, body
I'm on it, on it
All night
When I call the play, you can run it, run it
I love it, love it

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
You so nasty!

[Verse 1]
There is no such thing as revenge
You will not give as good as you got
There is no such thing as an eye for an eye
If you think you're the giver, you're not
There is no such thing as regret
There is no point in placing the blame
Hate destroys the one who hates
And everyone suffers the same

[Chorus]
What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go

[Verse 2]
There is only love and respect
To thine own self be true
When you point the finger
There are three fingers pointing back at you

[Chorus]
What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go

[Bridge]
Recognize that God is alive in everyone
Recognize that love lives in us all

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go
What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go

Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness. often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends.

April 17th, 2018

As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency. You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas.

distraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything.

everything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.

trend is always late

April 18th, 2018

when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.

You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.

I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.
in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to "the simulation".  Parents are our first acting coaches.

me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.

Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.

too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️ I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like "this person stole this from me" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂 let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.

don't trade your authenticity for approval

truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth

if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.

today will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better.

we're all servants

it's not where you take things from.  It's where you take them to

the beauty is in the imperfection(s)

April 20th, 2018
we need to Aman Giri the world

people are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype

all you have to be is yourself

I don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top.

images are limitless and words aren't. Words are defined

sharing is community holding information is capitalism

iterations of ideas are how culture evolves.

everything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty.

strive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness

style is genderless

Yeezy is based in Calabasas but will also be setting up offices in New York London and Wyoming

the world is our office

April 21st
I love the way Candace Owens thinks. only free thinkers

I don't subscribe the term and concept of God fearing.  That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ live in love not in fear. be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think.

get past the past

The more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve

April 22nd

question everything

the blinders are off

Demonization has metastasized. The psychological zombie effect. People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized

we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought. The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought.

Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there

We live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.

self victimization is a disease

April 23

we're evolving at warp speed

new ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons.

life is more exciting than the movies

even Prince once had an access pass

everyone should be their own biggest fan

I’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to do

If your foresight is incredible   Stay stubborn to your vision

you can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.

to be great is to be misunderstood

never a master. Always a student.

spread love

April 25

Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.

You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.

If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary
I love Hillary too.

I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican

And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.

with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.

I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say "I love you" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.

When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.

no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love

fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts

decentralize

burn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂

whenever someone mentions the word "fan" to me it's super manipulative. It's like "don't do or say this because of your fans"  My fans are fans of themselves.

And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️

April 26th, 2018

Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.

The world is our family

People usually don't agree with people who don't agree with them

if you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you

the concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.

Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do.

it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma

we are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel

spread love. Put more love into the universe.

Artist transform tragedy into beauty

[this book is still in progress...]
Phil? Phil? Can you play the drums please?
Phil: No, I can't
Thom: So we got the professional in now
No heavy petting please, whilst we're performing

[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge of the earth (Way out)
And fall off (Way out)
Yeah, everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

[Verse 3]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

[Outro]
Yeah I
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

[Chorus]
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
I won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

[Verse 1]
You used to be alright, what happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?
One by one, one by one
It comes to us all, it's as soft as your pillow

[Verse 2]
You used to be alright, what happened?
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever (Yeah!)
Fifteen steps then a sheer drop

[Chorus]
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
Let's rock and roll!

[Verse 1]
I do not understand
What it is I've done wrong
Full of holes, check for pulse
Blink your eyes, one for yes
Two for no

[Chorus 1]
I have no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Ooooohhhh, woah woah

[Verse 2]
You killed the sound, removed backbone
A pale imitation with the edges all
Sawn off

[Chorus 2]
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass
Ooooohhhh, woah woah

[Verse 3]
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm a lie

[Outro]
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no na na na na no
I've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming

[Chorus]
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

[Verse 1]
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

[Verse 2]
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

[Chorus]
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
Now…

Once I was alright, alright baby
Once I was Alright, alright baby
Once I was Alright, now…

Once I was alright, alright baby
Once I was Alright, alright baby
Once I was Alright, now…

Once I was alright, alright baby
Once I was Alright, alright baby
Once I was Alright, now…

[Verse 1]
Treat me like your patient
Just don't keep me waiting
Or I'll just be wasted
In a crowd of the lonely
I need you to inspire me
When I can't inspire myself
I need you to provide for me
When I feel like someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down

[Chorus]
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won’t you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ahah

[Verse 2]
Dose me with your energy
Leave your soul inside of me
Cool me down and calm me
Ring me, don't alarm me

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down

[Chorus]
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Ooh before it's too late
Won’t you steal me
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ahah

[Bridge]
I wanna be more or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed
I wanna be more or equal not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed

[Chorus]
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah-ah
Heal me, ah-ah
Heal me ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life lets you hide
All the sadness you feel

[Verse 2]
You won’t really fall in love
For you can’t take the chance
So be honest with yourself
Don’t try to fake romance

[Verse 3]
It’s the good life, to be free
And explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn
You must face life alone

[Verse 4]
Please remember, I still want you
And in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life goodbye
Me and Susie had a long way home
We were struggling with the weight of our load
It was too heavy I could see
Oh, but nobody listens to me

Rollin’ like a snake in the grass
Still gon’ get home right on time

I had brushed my jacket off, gotten back on my feet
When the hollerin’ came askin’ to me
"Darlin’ why you always playing a sweetheart?”
Guess that’s all I ever planned to be

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Verify, got haircut
Mu in this bitch, Scoob in this bitch with me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
So much shit on my mind, I just hope I don't smell like it
The motherfuckers pointing fingers
Be the same ones that have nail bitin'
Real niggas, still real niggas, you new niggas, just lil' niggas
When ya shit fall, don't be surprised
Acting like you didn't hear timber
I'm caffeinated, I'm half-sedated
I started from the bottom, I gravitated
I'm validated, I'm a trigger happy nigga
And it's sad to say it, but I had to say it
I had to do it, I had to stunt, act like I had what I had for once
With all of my thank yous added up
I still can't thank Birdman enough, I woke up in a new Tyra Banks
I've been gettin' money since Shabba Ranks
The car I'm in brand spankin' new, it just got spanked
Real niggas say rest in peace to DJ Screw
Rest in peace to Pimp C too
Fuck your bulletproof vest (blat) I still need proof, my nigga
I hate you like mustard, I'm disgustin'
I'm aiming at your chest, hit your face, I'm just rusty
Cherish every step that we take, some of us clumsy
Lookin' for a breath of fresh air, it's hidin' from me, fuck
Mall roll it up in the leaf, weed stronger than Zangief
I last longer than an antique, her pussy cummin' like a stampede
She cooks, fucks and clean, the type of bitch that every man need
The type of bitch that every man leave
That ain't cool, and she wearin' sleeves, but chill, just chill

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You could fuck all these bitches, except my bitches
Yeah right, I wish, with all three wishes
Man I swear she got too attached, had to cut the umbilical
Man I swear I'm so armed, I feel like I got tentacles
Niggas bumpin' their gums, I feel like Orajel
Got 'em scratchin' their head, combin' out broken nails
See I give 'em my love, but I'm an indian giver
Got my ear to the streets, I hear the enemy whisper
I break the bank with a sledgehammer
Cellphone rings like Saturn
Bitch let a nigga breathe, breathe like a dragon
I hide money everywhere, that's my hidden talent
One time for them gangstas, fuck that, two times for them gangstas
If you got a problem, I'll fix that like, yeah nigga I'm maintenance
Got a bad bitch and she anxious, bitch, you just an acquaintance
I'll ask a rat, "Why be a rat?" then kill him while he explainin'
Tell your foot soldiers to walk light, handful of real niggas left
And if any nigga wanna step to me tell 'em hurry up and take bigger steps
My bitch deep, I get in depth, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
She dyed her pussy hair red, she said she had to roll the red carpet out
That's real
So real

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah, girl you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill (gotta chill)
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill

[Outro: French Montana & Justin Bieber]
Yeah, Tunechi
Shawty is you gon' ride 'til it's over? (Ride, 'til it's over)
Man we gettin' high, never sober (High, never sober)
Still ridin' dirty 'til it's over (haaan, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny how, funny how
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

[Verse 2]
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming

[Outro]
And the walls bend, and the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
And the walls bend, and the walls bend
What is he doin' what is he doin'
This is the gloaming

[Verse 1]
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said: "I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice"

[Refrain]
"But now I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied"

[Verse 2]
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

[Refrain]
And I don’t know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don’t know why I feel so skinned alive

[Verse 3]
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smart-ass but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
Shook hands with the cripples and I gave them all milk
And I did a few card tricks for my mafia geeks
But now

[Refrain]
I don’t know why I feel so tongue-tied

Thom: Thank you
We're on it

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

[Chorus]
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
And fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial

[Verse 2]
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'good night'

[Chorus]
And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial

[Outro]
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Thom: Chicken Licken! Goosey Loosey!
Have you got your flying goggles mate?
Thom: What mate?
Have you got your flying goggles?

Thom: Can you start off and I'll see if I can remember it?
Thom: Amateur hour! It's us!

[Refrain]
You bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
You bit me, bit me, and now I want more

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers and the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of Police or Vice-Chancellor
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book

[Refrain]
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I got the poison, poison, and now I want more

[Verse 2]
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down, when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall

[Refrain]
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
The poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison

Thom: Thank you!

[Verse 1]
Flies are buzzing around my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem give me some

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Verse 2]
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Bridge]
I'd really like to help you man
I'd really like to help you man
Nervous messed up marionette
Floating around on a prison ship

[Outro]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Thom: What are you doing with that bottle?
Hey now, don't be mean
Thom: No that was mean no worries, I'm sorry
Come on
Thom: He's going to get me back later, it's alright

[Verse 1]
Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

[Verse 2]
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human, all human beings

[Verse 3]
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate (In rainbows)
Like ripples on a blank shore (In rainbows)

[Verse 4]
Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all human, all human beings

[Verse 1]
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

[Bridge]
4, 5, 6, 7 (I’m in heaven)

[Verse 2]
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

[Verse 3]
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

[Outro]
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies, there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies, there'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies, there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies, there'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies, there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies, there'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

Good!
Thom: Should we do that again then?
Do we really need to?
Thom: I'm joking!

[Verse 1]
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
What's it sayin'?

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Syd]
Star shine so bright (Hear it in your heart)
They're up so high (Hear it in your heart)
I wanna fly (Check your voicemail)
Hear your heart go

[Post-Chorus]
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Hear your heart go

[Verse 2 Steve Lacy]
As you're coming down
Where'd your heart go?

[Chorus Steve Lacy & Syd]
Star shine so bright (It's all in your heart)
They're up so high (It's all in your heart)
I wanna fly (Look no further)
Let your heart flow
(Let your heart flow)

[Post-Chorus]
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Let your heart flow
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll (all night), roll (all night), roll (all night)
Let your heart flow

[Outro (Everyone)]
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night

[Verse]
Herojuana blunts, cocaine up in her veins
She dancin', actin' strange
Herojuana blunts, I ain't for the games
Smokin' blunts, rollin' paper planes
What you want?
Uh, I'm the nigga, jump up out the Porsche
Lil' nigga wearin' big shorts, playin' sports
Uh, all up on my court, uh, Porsche
What I thought up in my thoughts
Now I rolled up and boarded, I'm a boss, yes
Niggas know they lost, in the sauce, why you forfeit?
And you know it's ours, it's legit, I'm the toilet bowl
Cocaine up in her veins
Actin' strange, she do it and they smokin' Mary Jane
Herojuana blunts, nigga
I ain't never flexin', never stuntin'
Cocaine up in her—
Cocaine up in her veins, watch her do her dance
Twenty thousand dollars, what you want?
A whole kilo, a brick-uh, a shit-uh
She took a, a sniff-uh, a quickie, a hit-uh
Her favorite, want to be her, her liquor
I seen her, a twister, I'm in her, I'm in her
I mean she dancin' like cocaine up in her veins
Watch her actin' strange
Vampire teeth, you should see her golden fangs
Cocaine up in her veins, while she gettin' brains
Sniff a line up on my dick
Herojuana blunts, nigga, I ain't never stunt
Herojuana blunts, twenty thousand dollars, what you want?
Cocaine up in her veins
Like cocaine up in her veins
Like cocaine up in her veins
Like Cobain up in her veins
Heroin is all up in her system
Ain't a damn thing changed
Gettin' faded on the tame
Gettin' faded off the thing, yeah

[Outro]
Don't take drugs
(Don't take drugs, don't take drugs)
Yes, mother!

[Verse 1: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
Heartache, heartbreaks all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 1: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

[Verse 2: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

[Pre-Chorus: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
Time flew, cut through all over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 2: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget

And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

[Intro]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for a girl birthday
They ordered champagne while they look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom-ish
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom-ish
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn-ish
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, Trish

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]

With nobody to love, nobody, no- (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and let this words paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand pictures

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna hit it hard on the sink
After that, get you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the girls I got the worst rep
But hey, that backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your chick for other chickens?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to furrget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]

Bound to fall in love

[Spoken Intro]
Drop it now
Gonna stop it now
Gonna git it now

[Verse 1]
Here he comes again
He’s gonna try to ruin my day
Never had a reason to dog me out
Did’n’t never make ‘em do what they say
Nine times outta ten
Ask him if he did he say no
I’ll never be a turncoat
Never be the one
To sell your name at the grocery store
You come around
Funny stuff be goin’ down
Ask him how it happened
Yo he don’t know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don’t care what people may say
I ain’t gon’ let it ruin my day
The best "remedie" for a basket full of lies
Is funk

[Chorus]
Ain’t nothin’ like funky music
To start me on my day
Got to gimme some of that music

[Verse 2]
Here she comes again
She got to tell the story her way
Once she’s caught a guy
That's doin’ somethin’ she don’t wanna
Takin’ money when the crime don’t pay
Every now and then
You’ll do somethin’ ... they said
One man’s justice is another man’s fear
Don’t you wish that you could sleep in my bed?
The only reason to say my name is to get your 15 secs of fame
Nobody’s even sure what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don’t care what people may say
I ain’t gon’ let it ruin my day
The best "remedie" for a basket full of lies
Is funk

[Chorus]
There’s nothin’ like funky music
Let the music play

[Spoken Ad Lib]
Oooh ooh, I'm crazy for coco rock
Well, it might not be The Grand Progression
But it sure is funky
Right on

[Breakdown]
Ooh funky music
Ooh funky music
Ooh funky music
Ain't nothin' like funky music
Ain't nothin' like funky music

How you gonna cap and be gone?
I hate to let you know but it's on
You might not like the taste
But I’m still gon’ stick your face in this funk

Gossip again?
Ho-hum
Listen to my drum

Digital music disappears in the daytime

[?] yo' face
Listen to my bass
Time will tell
We are
Listen to my guitar

[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t care what they say
We ain’t gon’ let it ruin our day
The best remedy for a big, fat punk is funk

[Chorus]
Ain’t nothin’ like funky music
Turn the music up

[Spoken Ad Lib]
Are you talkin’ to me?
All right
Somebody call 9-1-1
Y’all trippin’

Look here, Weavalicious
C’mer, let me talk to you
You and your boyfriend
Lemme tell you somethin’ right now
You run up on me again
With words or otherwise
And I’mma knock both you punks out

[Interlude]
Funky music
Funky music
Funky music

[Spoken Outro]
There you have it, world
That is passing away
We don’t care where you go
But you gotta get out o’ here
Okay?
Cancer, chronic fatigue, ugly or just plain po’
I love all y’all
Don’t you ever mess with me no mo’
What time is it?
All right then
That’s it, y’all
I’m out like the Wolves in the first
But we gonna get it together though
Pookie! The limo warm?
Cool
Peace y’all
Stay funky
Right on, right on

[Intro: Sample]
"Gabriella, mamy love you
I cannot wait to meet you
I'm so happy to have you in my life"

[Verse 1: Fiona Apple]
I can't wait to meet you for the first time
I don't know what I'll do that day
I'll cry and I'll laugh and I'll kiss you

[Chorus]
I will have you, you will have me
The world will be different and new
The world will be different and new

[Verse 2]
I hope you can do more things than I have
I hope you can follow your dreams

[Chorus]
I will have you, you will have me
The world will be different and new
The world will be different and new

[Verse 1]
Talk about a total change of pace
Another day, another lonely face
Another town to kick your boots around in
Never time to learn a single phrase

[Verse 2]
Suddenly you're home and through your door
It's not the best, but best you can afford
Wave and kiss goodbye to feeling lonely
A week or two at home and you'll want more

[Chorus]
There's no sunny days in outer space
To watch all your tears
Drifting and floating away

[Verse 3]
Talk about a total change of heart
Handed out and fully ripped apart
Cheers to you for never breaking down
So surprised you ever came this far

[Verse 4]
Once you're home and settled in your bed
Don't act as though you've simply been misled
Let her know you love her if you do, boy
Let her know what's on the road ahead

[Chorus]
There's no sunny days in outer space
To watch all your tears
Drifting and floating away
There's no sunny days in outer space
And truthfully told
I'd have it no other way

[Outro]
Where'd everybody go?

[Verse 1]
Exercise to stay alive
Another year has gone and passed you by
Waking up to coffee cup
Stretch it out, rip it up

[Pre-Chorus]
When the old man gets a-steamin
He'll be whistling
All his worries away
And I know just how you see them
Keep believin'
That you'll find your foot someday

[Chorus 1]
But you won't, will you boy?
But no you won't, will you boy?
It's not what you want, is it boy?
It's not what you want

[Verse 3]
Exercise another way
To live your life, some other day ahead
Sleepin' in the day begins
When you decide to rise up from your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
When the old man gets to see it
Understand that all his dreamin' days are gone
And I hope now that you'll feel it
Your belief in all this nonsense is done

[Chorus 2]
But it's not, is it boy?
No it's not, is it boy?
So take what you've got, can't you boy?
Take what you've got

[Outro]
Jesus...
(One two three four)
Trouble believing
What's been going on
Found yourself a new home
Who knows for how long

Is it wrong to feel afraid
Of things that don't affect you now
But surely will someday?
Is it wrong to try to change
The style of your conversation
Just to get your way

These troubles I'm seeing
These days no one knows what to believe in

Trouble believing
Anything you're told
Nothing is much easier
Older than you've grown
It's getting harder now to tell
What's right from wrong by yourself
It's getting harder now, it seems
No one ever understands exactly what you mean

These troubles I'm seeing
These days no one knows what to believe in
These troubles I'm seeing
These days no one knows what to believe in

There is no one else like You
In spite of all the things I do
To the Most High, I salute
'Cause there is no one else

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
I've traveled the world
Seen a lot of things
Seen a lot of sunshine
Been through a lot of pain, Lord (so much pain)
I tried to depend on my friends
To help me make it through
But at the end of the day, Lord
I found out there is no one else like You, Lord

[Chorus]
There is no one else like You
In spite of all the things I do
To the Most High, I salute
'Cause there is no one else
No matter what the case is
The mountains that I'm facin'
Your love it never changes, I know
There is no one else like You

[Verse 2]
You're the Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end
Before anyone else
You're my closest friend
When times got hard
He was always there for me
When Satan thought he had me bound
You were there to set me free
Yes, you were, Lord

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Searched high and low
I gotta take you wherever I go
Look around, there's only One
I know, I know, (listen)
But, Lord, You lifted me
Now I'm walking on higher ground
I ain't got to worry about tomorrow
As long as You right next to me

[Chorus]

(No one else, No one else)
Been around the world
(No one else, No one else)
Can't find nobody
(No one else, No one else)
Nobody, nobody
Oh oh my Lordy
Oh, my Lord
Oh yeah, gonna be alright
Yes, it is

[Intro]
Rap tune
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune, Fayettenam hands up
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Say what?

[Verse 1]
The real is back
The Ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's
Finest
You knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
Sing!
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then what?
Then you aim too low

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up on that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, sing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
Sing
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then what?
Then you aim too low

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga
You ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Say what?
Nigga
Cole the God
Cole the God, Cole the God
2, 6, nigga! (laughs)
January 28th...(laughs)

[Outro]
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
One day I'll make a million dollars off a rap tune

[Outro]
*Crowd cheers*
Oh shit
Fayetteville, North Carolina
Fayettenam
*Crowd cheers*
2, 6, make some motherfuckin' noise one time tonight, God damn it! Bring all the lights up please so I could see everybody in this motherfucker one time tonight, God damn. Ayy, this shit's crazy. Ayy, this shit crazy. All the way in the back, wassup, we see y'all niggas in the back, wassup? Okay, left side, wassup, we see y'all niggas, man. Right side, what's poppin', God damn it! Ayy, yo, you know we see this shit down here, this shit lit, this shit lit. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself. I go by the name of J. Cole, Cole fucking World, and I'm from the Ville. A few months back, I dropped this album, it's called 2014 Forest Hills Drive, and shit I don't know if people heard about that shit. They tryna say, they tryna say it was the first album to go platinum without no fuckin' features and shit. They said that, they said that, I ain't say that, they said that, but since they said that, since they said that. Fayetnam, if it's cool with y'all, and only if it's cool with y'all, I'm tryna perform the whole fuckin' album for ya'll tonight if that's cool with you. Can I do that shit on some Ville shit? Ok then, on some Ville shit, ok then. But y'all know this whole album is a journey, from front to back, this whole shit is a journey. So before we get too far in the fucking journey, I wanna press rewind and take ya'll to a time where I was just a young boy

[Verse 1]
Hey - call me back when ya get this
Or when you've a minute
We really need to talk
Wait - you know what
Maybe just forget it
Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Chorus]
"Stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way...
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor

[Verse 2]
Look - now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if ya read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Chorus]
You hear "stay" and "bla bla bla"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Dontcha, babe
I'm not your party favor

[Verse]
I see you tan-tan-tan-tan-tan
I see you getting kind of thin
I see you waiting for the time, honey
I see you getting kind of thin, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cuz you know you're right to make it okay
All the time when you try to make me feel good

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
This tough love
Til we push and fall til we start to let go
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
This tough love
Touch, touch, hard feelings to control
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I see your heart is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, for me, uh

[Verse]
I see you tan-tan-tan-tan-tan
I see you getting kind of thin
I see you waiting for the time, honey
I see you getting kind of thin, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cuz you know you're right to make it okay
All the time when you try to make me feel good

[Verse 1]
Can someone tell me why I'm still in the same place I've been?
I don't get as much out as I think I put in
There's no promise I've heard that a life can't outlive
That's not for me to say, but please tell me what is

[Chorus]
I don't care to mean anything to someone
I just want to mean something in general
There are memories that I have of days done
One thing I’ve noticed is that they always seem better than today

[Verse 2]
I'm sure there's a psychological explanation
But there's no vacation
For a mind with low tendency for creation
And I tend to avoid any situation
That requires any level of sophistication
I know my heart is not physically breaking
I'll wake up tomorrow intrinsically fading

[Bridge]
I haven't been incredibly social as of late
And I think that that's okay
But my left brain it's gonna kill me
And I know my songs will still be
Here at the end of the day
Those who still believe in fate
Should listen to me intently

[Chorus]
I don't care to mean anything to someone
I just want to mean something in general
There have been memories of days that have since come undone
One thing I've noticed is they were more fun than today
I don't wanna see today
I don't really wanna play
There's no reason to stay
There's no reason to stay
There's a television
There's a television
Speaking to me
There's a French girl
On my television
She's crying in the palm of my hand

We're moving mental
I read the paper, or just the photos
I rip one out in my hand
There's a massacre, across the ocean
I can see it in the palm of my hands

But on the ground floor
I'm losing signal, we lost connection
I left her crying, she was still crying
Now she's lying in my head

Public off the rail, shrapnel flying
Extra-explosives
For a riot, to the end
What am I good for?
I cannot see no-one
I'm violent, to the voice in my head
I don't want this planet

I phone my ex x12

[Chorus]
Look what the cat did
Look what the cat dragged in
I just imagined, and all of that happened
Look what the cat did
Look what the cat dragged in
I just imagined, and all of that happened

[Verse 1]
You can't train a cat to sit down
You can't make him trust you for nothing
If you think I'm shaking your hand
Then ya must be stupid or somethin'

[?]
I promise I rap in my sleep
I do not even do drugs
But I got some crack up my sleeve
Rub me right here, no, there
Rub me the wrong way and I leap
He love to rub on my tummy, like
Pet it and scratch and repeat
I'm not these broads, I'm not these frauds when I drop records
If you pulling on my tail then I'd prolly have to show you how I got these scars (Huh)

[Chorus]
Look what the cat did
Look what the cat dragged in
I just imagined, and all of that happened
Look what the cat did
Look what the cat dragged in
I just imagined, and all of that happened

[Verse 2]
(Shut the fuck up and sit down)
If you ain't with it you higher than Tweety Bird playing on a meteorite
All you kids want is media hype 

[?]
Tell moms that you prolly gone die puttin' promethazine in you Pedialyte
I don't want your beats, I'd rather get caught in crossfire 'tween Tina and Ike
In the Jim like Carey, I'm Tom you Jerry, run along you scary, you pussy, nigga
Swipe left on Tinder, you Timon I'm Simba for desert and dinner here's a cookie, nigga
Got a big fat pussy call me Arbuckle
When you go to say hello call the Garfield
I know that you see me flexin' like an arm muscle
But I'm still real reserved ya can't park here

[Chorus]
Look what the cat did
Look what the cat dragged in
I just imagined, and all of that happened
Look what the cat did
Look what the cat dragged in
I just imagined, and all of that happened

[Verse 1]
It's never too late, to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
And it's never too late, to leave if you wanna leave
Or stay if you wanna stay, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm

Instead of what's in front of me, yeah
And it's never too late, to be free if you wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I got a feeling in my bones
Guess I got love on the brain
Giving into your affliction
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

[Verse 1]
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

[Chorus]
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 2]
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

[Chorus]
That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

[Intro]
You know how to whistle, don't ya?
Just put your lips together
Just put your lips together

[Verse 1]
You can be a pop princess, put you in a party dress
You can make your smile white
You can party up all night
And you can take your jazz galore-lore, I ain't goin' anymore
You strike me as the type of guy
Who doesn't know what he's lookin' for
You say that you're gangsta in that the whole world's against ya
I can be your liaison to all things fine

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
Everybody knows I'm a lucky dice, lucky roll
If you want me back, just put your lips together and blow

You know how to whistle, don't ya?
You know who's the most fun, don't ya?

Just put your lips together and blow, blow

[Verse 2]
I can be your dirty bitch, bitch
I can be your only wish
Don't you think it's time to switch
Switch it up, baby, please?
'Cause you're doin' the same thing, you'll get the same thing
Don't you want better? You was a smart boy
Don't you want heaven?
Don't you want heaven here on earth?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
If you want me back, all you have to do is sin
Put your lips together, put your lips together

[Chorus]
You know how to whistle, don't ya?
Put your lips together, won't ya?
And blow, and blow-oh-oh
You know how to whistle, don't ya?
You know who's the most fun, don't ya?

Put your lips together, put your lips together

[Chorus]
You know how to whistle, don't ya?
You know who's the most fun, don't ya?
Don't ya know, babe?
Just put your lips together and blow

If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
If you want me back, all you have to do is sin
Put your lips together and blow
Let me in, if you

If you wanna win, let me in, let me in

[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side, the hunger satisfied

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun

We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the door

We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride!

I'm taxin' if you're fake nigga

Getting kind of mad, about to lose my shit
Thinking I should jump, jumping out the window

Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
If you don’t, you’ll be alone

[Bridge]
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Verse]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I make bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Break]
Maybe I'll
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

Pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.
You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.

If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary
I love Hillary too.

I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be.

Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican

And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.

with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.

I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say "I love you" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.

When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.

no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love

fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts

decentralize

burn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂

Yeezy VC invests in and develops food clothing shelter and communications
my wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does. I don't agree 100% with anyone but myself.

...

I’m nice at ping pong

we got love

my MAGA hat is signed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I'm so happy to hear that Peter Thiel would like to take a meeting. I feel very optimistic about the future.

...

whenever someone mentions the word "fan" to me it's super manipulative. It's like "don't do or say this because of your fans"  My fans are fans of themselves.

And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️

2 of my favorite people

[Donald Trump tweet]

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Uh, uh

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm a God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off

[Verse]
Parents are the strippers, strip kids of they confidence
Teach white dominance, question your common sense
See, I've been washed in tradition and I'ma rinse

[Refrain]
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm a God"
It's always a lituation when I'm involved
See, I say what they say when the mic is off

[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of moving on
Spending every weekend so far gone
Heat wave, nothing to do
Woke up in my clothes having dreamt of you

[Verse 2]
Swirl in the white evening sun
Tell me that I'm the only one
And I hope I never get a clue
Green eyes, I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
And I hope whoever it is
Holds their breath around you
'Cause I know I did
And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

[Verse 3]
Passing phases wear you thin
Same old world that you've been sleeping in
And I hope it never spends you up
Green eyes, what could ever be enough?

[Chorus]
And I hope the love that you find
Swallows you wholly
Like you said it might
And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

[Outro]
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes

[Verse 1]
Darling
Before you came to see me
There probably wasn't too much on my mind
But kind is all I could be
And color, is all I found inside her
Painting over me with perfect lines
Stacked up nice and neat, didn't have to try

[Chrous]
But I'm not
Too great of an artist
Too great of an artist
But for you, I'll probably try
I can sing
And I can write songs for you
And I can buy you clothes too
Just cause I like it when you smile

[Verse 1]
Darling
If the sun fails to burn you
If the light fails to turn you
Remember you've got your own fire
And if, you'll promise me something
Please make it that nothing's
Gonna push me out your mind

[Chrous]
But I'm not
Too great of an artist
Too great of an artist
But for you, I'll probably try
I can sing
And I can write songs for you
And I can buy you clothes too
Just cause I like it when you smile
I will twine mid my ringlets of raven black hair
The lilies so pale and the roses so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale amaryllis and violets so blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh will be gay
I'll cease this wild weeping drive sorrow away
Tho my heart is now breaking, he'll never know
His name made me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through ill and misfortunes all others above
Now another has won him, oh misery to tell
He left me in silence no word of farewell
He taught me to love him, he called me his flower
That blossomed for him all the brighter each hour
But I awoke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
My visions of love have all faded away

I'll think of him never, I'll be wildly gay
I'll charm every heart and the crowd I will sway
I'll live yet to see him regret the dark hour
He won and neglected the frail wildwood flower

[Intro]
"Life" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
Put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't looking
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around swearing that they was always down
What is life?

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

[Hook]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM
Tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs, wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringing half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop lives"

[Hook]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
Y'know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Y'know what I'm saying?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Y'know what I'm saying?
And right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay
Y'know what I'm saying?
But hey, it's cool though
Y'know what I'm saying?
I'm just fed up
That's my word

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er…

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
"Hi, Marshall!"
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Hook: Eminem]
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Outro: Eminem]
Shit, fuck everybody!
Outsidaz, Pacewon, Young Zee

But they don't really realize, though
Said we need to strive for more liberty
This next verse, this next verse though
Lift yourself up on your feet
These bars
Lift yourself up on your feet
Watch this, go

And now we in the club like

Sunglasses (glasses), black tee, man (tee, man)
Red carpet all cameras on me, man (me, man)
But the cameras can't see what I see, man (see)
Why I had to treat the haters like fleas, man
Mu'fuckers wanna talk about me man
I check the ice and I brush off my sleeve, man
I'm too hyped to have dirt off my shoulders
Lyrics from heaven church, thought I told ya
Tasha told Kim that Lisa said Mike said
"Kell's doin drugs now, man - he a crackhead"
Y'all mean to tell me y'all believe that?!
But I do be askin' "where the weed at?" (Easy, killa)
Cause I'm a go-getta come day or night (I said easy, killa)
And I already got my money right, right, right!

Whoa!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know I was foul, baby
Ayy, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know...
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no VISA
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar...

[Chorus x2: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know?

What do you know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)

C'mon! So flash your light on me! (Flash your light on me...)
So that the world can see! (So the world can see...)

[Intro: Four Tops]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

[Verse: Kanye West & T.I.]
I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit…
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me."
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

[Outro: Kanye West]
Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?
Hey yo, what do you think about two grown ass men
Living together?
Alright. What do you think about another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well those two grown ass men
Living together on my nuts
And that shits right above them

When I rhyme somehow I think I must subliminally
Throwing viagra at these fags who got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits except for Michaels' nose!
I didn’t know, I'm so sorry please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended. Ooh!
I got it, I got it, apology for Steve Harvey too, it’s in my pocket
(Oh wait, here it is)
FUCK YOU!! Hey!
What do you say Andre whats new? Life is good man I’m chilling, 50 how 'bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we’ll make it through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace, G-G-G-UNIT!

[Verse 1]
My generation's stuck in the mirror
"Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word"
I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard
And I am afraid of that which I do not know
So why don't I just ask your fucking name?
Justice just gets buried in a white light
I heard there was a time you'd call it shame

[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here

[Verse 2]
Your cynicism buys me no more time here
Imagine my relief to hit the walls
Running from the weight of ancient labels
And leaving what identity there was
Well, my generation's stuck in the mirror
"Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word"
And I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard

[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here

[Bridge]
Let's raise our hands for a moment
And leave it all behind
Don't be afraid for a moment
The blind leading the blind

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here
Verse:
There's Tears in my soup
And my salad's gone sour
Cause you left me here
At this Olive Garden altar
Girl
I might be broke
But my love is no joke
I can't take you overseas
But I'll give you a taste of Italy

Chorus(x2):
This is my Breadstick Ballad
I'll give you more if you'll have it
And I'll feed you endless love
If you eat this endless lunch

(Girl, I wanna take you out, show you a good time. you can have anything you like, Tuscan Chicken Salad, Endless Soup Salad and Breadsticks lunch for $14.99)

Chorus(x1)
I don't want no Carrabba's
I don't want no Red Lobster
I want you here with me girl in this green garden
I don't want no more Applebee's
I want you here baby please
I'm down on my hands and knees singin'

(Harmonizing)
Go
Get it all
Let 'em watch
Let it fall
Nameless
Sweat it out
They don't love you
Do they?

Grace
Born and raised
Cut you down
Still bleeds the same
As it is
For you, anytime
Still, for you, anytime

[Verse 1]
Oh, don't see you now
Wait, don't just give out
Move from your old house
The city can be so loud

[Hook]
Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow

[Verse 2]
Lose sight of wherever you are
Do you know when you've gone too far?
If it's all ash and dust
Well, then I won't let you take me for a ride

[Hook]
Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow
Leave things on speaking terms
And I'll see you around
It's all ash and dust
And I won't let you take me for a ride
And it's all over us
And still I won't let you take me for a ride

And she say it's big, but she not scared though (scared though)
And I pull her wig on the back board (back board)

This one went to jail
This one shares his piece of mind
This one read a book
This one read a book

This one is a dog
This one is a little mouse
I will kill the mouse

I am a good man
Because I make mama smile
Let me in the house
I am a good dog

Let me in the house
Because I am a good dog
Let me in a house

Walking down the street
I will hold my head up high
I will text my friends

Walking down the street
I will look you in the eye
This one is a dog
This one is a dog
This one is a dog
This one is a dog
This one is a dog
This one is a dog
I want to kiss you all day.
I want to start at dawn.
I want our mouths to dry out by breakfast.
I want our jaws to start cramping by noon.
I want us to question our decision to kiss all day by hour five.
I want to have sex really quickly then seriously stop all this kissing bullshit because you need your personal space, apparently.

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of my mind I know it's hard on us
But to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love
It's not easy to say, I’m giving up
And I've been losing count

[Pre-Chorus]
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
You've been working 9 to 5
So it was hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

[Verse 2]
Nahh, All the shit that you say, do you mean it?
And when you tell me you love me do you believe it?
I can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it
And I've been missing out

[Pre-Chorus]
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
Working 9 to 5 cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason

[Chorus]
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

[Verse 1]
I'm a boss in the game
I deserve six rings
I go hard in the paint
They wanna know my number and my name
They swear to God I got a cheat code
I'm going for the three
This shit is easy like a free throw
I go beast mode
Ballin' on 'em
93 Mike Jordan on 'em
Swish nigga
It's all in the wrist nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
And we aim for the top everyday just to change our lives
Know the name, know the game
Know the things that they ain't gon' like
Not afraid to express what it takes so we made our own way
You not in the game, I call shots in the game like...

[Chorus]
Huh what's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play
What's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play

[Verse 2]
I'm on my Wayne Gretzky
I got so much ice on
Smoking on that strong pack, strong pack
Hit it hard, Mike Tyson
Sliding home plate, safe
Paid in full just like ace
But I ain't working at the cleaners
I get that pack and serve it like Serena
Ballin' on 'em
93 Mike Jordan on 'em
Touchdown
We got the club going up
I'm bout to roll something up

[Pre-Chorus]
And we aim for the top everyday just to change our lives
Know the name, know the game
Know the things that they ain't gon' like
Not afraid to express what it takes so we made our own way
You not in the game, I call shots in the game like...

[Chorus]
Huh what's the play
Yeah what's the play
What's the play
Huh what's the play
What's the play
Yeah what's the play

[Intro]
Avery On the Beat
Yuh

[Chorus]
O-Out the coupe, wrist out the coupe
Bad bitch on a private jet, birds in the zoo
I-I'm in love with Chanel, I-I like Louis, too
Pull up in a Porsche, I'm like, "Ooh", baby, who is you?
O-Out the coupe, wrist out the coupe
Bad bitch on a private jet, birds in the zoo

I'm dripped in Off-White (Yuh), count money all night
Got bitches, different types (Huh), I mix lean with Sprite
Bitches in bikinis (Huh), pull up in a Bimmer
Pull up, Lamborghini (I skrrt, skrrt), it's two seater
Left wrist, Aquafina (I whip, whip, whip), left wrist, eggbeater
Pull up in the whip (Drop-top), and I got my heater
Word around town (Skrrt, skrrt), I got bricks and pounds
Word around the city (Blaow, boom), got a hundred rounds
I just put my wrist out the coupe (I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
In a fast lane, birds out the zoo
If a nigga play with gang (Blaow, boom, boom), grab that yop, we shoot
Bust down my Rollie, everything on me new (Ooh)

[Chorus]
O-Out the coupe, wrist out the coupe
Bad bitch on a private jet, birds in the zoo
I-I'm in love with Chanel, I-I like Louis, too
Pull up in a Porsche, I'm like, "Ooh", baby, who is you?
O-Out the coupe, wrist out the coupe
Bad bitch on a private jet, birds in the zoo
I-I'm in love with Chanel, I-I like Louis, too
Pull up in a Porsche, I'm like, "Ooh", baby, who is you?

[Intro]
Gave you everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (Take it all back, hey)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you (Yeah, brr)
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 1]
Mmm, see, I used to curve niggas like you
Skrr, skrr, swerve niggas like you
Even though I heard what you might do
I didn't get concerned 'cause I liked you
But no, no, I can't hide who you are
I can't lie, it's too hard (So hard, so hard)
I need more than what you got from me
You want a bad bitch and new cars

[Chorus]
And I gave you everything, yeah
Think I need to take it all back (Take it all, take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that’s on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 2]
I know how to flip niggas like you
I get petty and clip niggas like you
Fuck around and forget niggas like you
Promise I could never miss niggas like you
Said no, no
Feelings fading away, I can't hear what you say
I need more than what you got for me
You got a bad bitch who won't stay

[Chorus]
And I gave you everything, yeah
You gon' need to take it all back (Take it all, take it all back)
I gave you everything, yeah
But you don't know what to do with all that
And that's on everything
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Ring, ring, never pick up on you, oh
I'ma have to switch, switch up on you
Snip, snip, hit that nip tuck on you
Let go, time to give up on you

[Verse 3]
Yo, give up on 'em, I don't even wanna get up on 'em
And I ain't tryna work it out
But I'm at the gym on a mat doin' sit-ups on 'em
You let yourself go, you don't represent O’
So trust me, just go
You settle for less, yo, you disrespectful
You was special, the new you just dull
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come off my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that edible
Which means them bags stacked high
You ain't got the drive, my nigga ya pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, every day, a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'bout your mattresses
But um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must've thought I did
I should have copped the stick, but I'm teflon
Pressed on, headstrong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If his word bond and he wanna sex icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you was, tryna stunt on Nick?
Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets, nigga
'Cause a true bad bitch ain't weak or bitter

[Intro: Laura Les]
(Indiscernible lyrics)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel you
And how it feels to know, though
I can't give it up
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel it now
And how it feels to find out
I can't give it up, can't give it up

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Sitting around, don't know what you're doing now, but that's okay
Feeling now, got a phone, doing shit but I'm on the phone
Mad now, I'm smoking dope, god damn that's a whole lot of dope
Good shit, that's all I know

[Chorus: Laura Les]
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel you
And how it feels to know, though
I can't give it up
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel it now
And how it feels to find out
I can't give it up, can't give it up
I can't feel it now

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Feeling now, don't know what I'm feeling now but that's okay
Doing shit on the phone, got a phone so that's okay
Phone is dead but I ain't dead but I'm talking to you so that's okay
God damn Matt, find my rope

[Chorus: Laura Les]
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel you
And how it feels to know, though
I can't give it up
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel it now
And how it feels to find out
I can't give it up, can't give it up

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Can't give it up
I can't give it up
I can't hear ya

[Verse 3: Dylan Brady]
Feeding now, got a doge, and a phone, so my dog's a phone
Eating now, on the floor, feeling like "Oh, that's okay"
Feeding doge my femur bone but my teeth break on the bone
Good shit, fuck teeth, okay, doggo

[Verse 1]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?

[Verse 2]
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long

[Chorus]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

[Bridge]
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off
And shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off
And shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no

[Chorus]
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

[Outro]
Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been taught by greed
Ohh Lord, what's wrong, what's wrong with me?
Ohh Lord, but that is all I see

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been taught by greed
Ohh Lord, what's wrong, what's wrong with me?
Ohh Lord, but that is all I see

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life I've been blind I've been taught by greed
Ohh Lord, what's wrong, what's wrong with me?
Ohh Lord, but that is all I see
Welcome, welcome boys and girls into a more distracted world – comprised of all the things you knew but older now (that's me and you) –the things inside post – 'don't you mind' reflect upon a recent time – where you and I were both online and part of a collective mind And still are we online you see but with much more consultancy – In groups we search ironically to find our self identity, embracing femininity, skeptics of affinity – maybe neither actually – deleting all civility – and fearing most proximity – but that has happened 'obviously' if you look retrospectively – but that's my point – that hindsight there – it's captured our collective stare a constant daze at bygone days seduced by programmed time delays – inside our phones our need has grown for inside there we're not alone – you see it's not all doom and gloom, just sanctify outside your room – it's easy when you're made aware, a more authentic captured stare – and something else to celebrate the fact that we can stay up late and share and care and make aware, some stranger who is over there – and change and mould and right some wrongs whilst streaming all our favourite songs – the left and right grow more apart but you can just click 'add to cart'.
Chelsea
Why you gotta be so mean?
You run right home to daddy
And leave momma on the street
Chelsea
Believe me

Chelsea
You knew this day would come
And tell me, You still believe in love
You bitch, You dog
You did my mother all wrong
And tell me, You'd expect it's time to move on
Chelsea
Believe me

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi with Anthony Ferraro]
Oooh
A doctor and her lover settled in a Ratcliff home
Oooh
Taking day trips to Bolinas, they can barely see the road
She says, "My meeting's cancelled, in the morning, let's stay"
So baby please wait

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Let me give you a hug until this is the light, touch your eyes
Or at least 'til the song finishes and we still try to sing along
Rock and roll is here to stay

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi with Anthony Ferraro]
A boy who sings about how he's in a squeeze
Ends up with oranges and an unused degree
Oooh
She wears those earrings almost every day
Trapezoid shapes, everything seems so simple
You can't tell if it's basically fake, scenes from a tape
Cars on the edge passing hill after hill

[Chorus: Toro y Moi]
Let me give you a hug until this is the light, touch your eyes
Or at least 'til the song finishes and we still try to sing along
Rock and roll is here to stay

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
Let's awaken and turn on our minds
No one is waiting for you in this line
So carry yourself on up, With no reason for delay
Before you didn't even care to ask
About the present or impending plans
I'm off for the day
It's whatever you wanna do

[Hook: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
I can get you what you want
It's good to see you keep in touch

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
It doesn't bother me anymore
I know it seems as if you were ignored
But know that you weren't so tell me again
Bear with me, I'm not good at keeping up

[Verse 3: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
Moving on, no more opinions now
The time is coming where we all dip out
So I'll follow you, or you follow me
Does anyone know where we go from here?

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Oh!

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
Looking for the one to blame is tough
Doesn't matter what you're talking about
She's gonna keep calling your bluff
We're not the only ones doing this

You see the buffalo, just another one in the road
We laugh about it in his face caught between the rock and the other place
I know how this goes, it's always gonna be the boy who gives It's always gonna be the girl to please
Did you get anything? I'll see

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way to keep on

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
He doesn't seem to get the joke
He's turning yellow, as a yolk
Someone took away his microphone
Pushed him off the stage till he's on his own
Can't feel a thing when he takes a shot
Ends up taking three right to the eyes
Cash in when the time is right
Can't stop by if he ever stops
Get down from there, or fall
Don't make us wait, too long

[Refrain: Toro y Moi with Anthony Ferraro]
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way to keep on
(Hold it on, cause you'll find a way to keep on)
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way
Cause you love it all
Cause you'll find a way to keep on

[Verse 1]
It's hard where you're living
Adding weight to make it balanced
Saying it could be too much
But he's clasping to his tie

[Verse 2]
There was a finer life
When I was with my friends
And I could always see my family
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm here
And I know they won't be waiting

[Refrain]
Cause I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be here alone

[Verse 3]
While you're there give back a little more
The return could make you notice
That I'm thinking of a moment
And know its still sound

[Verse 4]
There was a finer life
When you were with us here
And we knew there was a next time
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm there
And I think that you won't be waiting

[Refrain]
Cause I don't want to be alone
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
It's hard where you're living
It's hard where you're living
'Cause I don't want to be alone
No, I don't want to be here alone
Oh ah ah ah
Oh ah
Oh ah ah ah
Oh ah

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
Friday night we go watch music
Saturday we do Half Dome
If you want to go ahead
Just let me know

That wasn't all that bad
Oh well, I'll sleep tomorrow
I think I'ma take it slow
So don't wait up

[Chorus: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
Ahhh
You must be waiting
You must be waiting
You must be waiting
You must be waiting
Ohh, you must be waiting for me
You must be waiting
You must be waiting
Oh, you must be waiting
Ohh, you must be waiting for me
You must be waiting or you
You must be waiting

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
I won't dare to look at time
Look at who you are beside, no-o

[Chorus: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
You must be waiting
Ohh, you must be waiting for me
You must be waiting
You must be waiting
Oh, you must be waiting
Ohh, you must be waiting for me
You must be waiting or you
You must be waiting

[Verse 1]
I'll let you fall asleep on the floor
Nothing's on so I'll just ignore
Don't bother to wake me up
You said nothing's worse than leaving a dream
No one gets me more than you
What is it you want to do
Let's go outside to the green

[Hook]
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one (there's only one)
Something's wrong (something's wrong)

[Verse 2]
I'd only go if we got in for free
Counted the rows I hope you're right by me
You shut your eyes while I look at the sky
Then you ask how long was the flight

[Hook]
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one (there's only one)
Something's wrong (something's wrong)
We've got all we want (all we want)
There's no place to go (place to go)
There's only one! (only one)
Oh, something's wrong! (something's wrong)

[Verse 1]
She's the only one he knows
Rest of us watch and go
He's not a television watcher
You can't get him back

[Chorus]
Every day's like this
No one gets nowhere
Everyone's like this
No one gets nothing
Like you
Like me

[Verse 2]
This space is up for grabs
I give it to you for free
Forgetting is such a task
So take what you please

[Chorus]
Every day's like this
No one gets nowhere
Everyone's like this
No one gets nothing
Like you
Like me
Like you
Like me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You and me
Can be what we want to be
Don't you let
This come falling down on me

I can hold
It in my arms
And I don't expect
Anything in return

[Hook]
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be getting up when we're down
And the big one's coming
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be giving up when we're down
And the big one's coming

[Verse 2]
We'll be living high
We'll be living low
I can't give it either way
I don't think I know

I don't care at all
You can take me now
You can take me then
Doesn't matter if you fall

She'll be living high
She'll be living low
She can give it either way
I don't think she knows

She don't care at all
You can take her now
You can take her then
Doesn't matter if she falls

She'll be living low
We'll be living low

[Hook]
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be getting up when we're down
And the big one's coming
We'll be living high
Living
We'll be giving up when we're down
And the big one's coming

[Intro: Toro y Moi]
I'm alright
Out here with you
It doesn't bother me
I know you think it does
It's us making grown up calls
You got more than my love

[Hook: Toro y Moi]
You only take, you won't bite
I can't kiss her, so I
I move over one, It's not enough
To me it's fine
At least I try
And I know
I keep it to myself
I don't want to have it all
All on the floor
Like everything
You see me do
Its not my fault
It's not too common for it to turn out wrong
Oh
It's not too common for it to turn out wrong

[Bridge: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
I'll always be by you
I don't want you thinking
I'll miss you

[Hook: Toro y Moi]
You only take, you won't bite
I can't kiss her, so I
I move over one, It's not enough
To me it's fine
At least I try
And I know
I keep it to myself
I don't want to have it all
All on the floor
Like everything
You see me do
Its not my fault
It's not too common for it to turn out wrong
Oh
It's not too common for it to turn out wrong

[Outro: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
I'll always be by you
I don't want you thinking
I'll miss you

And I've got her now

[Hook: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]
She's alright

We're alright
We can't go back

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi & Anthony Ferraro]

I never left
Don't think like that

[Kanye]
Like these is all super pretty things that make you feel everything is safe
I got my polo shirt, I got my horse, it's all good
I got my cross on me

[T.I.]
I agree, but I just think that when you have lives lost
As artists, that gives us an obligation to stand up against all of that kinda shit

[Kanye]
You know, me putting the hat on forces an evolution because
There's, even for me, I know so much more in the past 3 days
Because I'm getting this energy, positive or negative
Agreeing with me, disagreeing with me
It's like, and that like sharpens the diamond, that shit
Our mind, our conscienceness the way we're thinking
Just breaking some shit

[T.I.]
Your intentions, from what you tell me, are pure
But the direction that you took to get there is a bit unorthodox
And kind of... I would say - some people would say thoughtless

[Kanye]
If I had not done what I felt and I just thought
Then it would've just never happened
And when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality
Like "oh I can wear this hat too"
I think people get mad at me when I name my idols
And I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney

[T.I.]
I just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt

[Kanye]
I really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them
Half the shit Trump does, I don't agree with

[T.I.]
What half do you agree with?
Let's get that out

[Kanye]
Just the ability to do what no one said you could do
To do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me

[Kanye, to someone else in the room]
Did you play that umm, the one that said
"Tell Daddy what you learned in school"
(You wanna play with that, boy?)
I wanna play with that, yeah
(Alright, okay)

[Kanye, on a playback of "Ye Vs The People"]
"I was in debt and the car that broke
The same shit I've been saying for years they called it "loc"
Successful man, a man that 

[?] the 

[?]
The most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes
And play with them"

[Kanye]
You could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that

[T.I]
Sure

[Kanye]
You know what I'm saying?
And your shit come in, you say
"Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?
How could that be?

[murmurs]"
You know what I'm saying?
The exact conversation we're having
And what would you say?

[T.I.]
Sure
"Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this
Some things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against"
That would kinda 

[gestures], you know

[T.I., in recording studio]
Let me hear it bro, let me see what we got here

[T.I. listens on a set of headphones]

[T.I., recording]
"... you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down"

[Kanye, recording]
"... know everybody emotional
"Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?
Because it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?"

Or uhh, I could fuck your bitch

[T.I., recording]
"Here's a suggestion, be selective with your critical views
Of people who done made greater contributions than you"

[Kanye, on a playback of "Ye Vs The People"]
"I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, I felt like I could be president"

[Intro: Choir]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Trap up out the bando

Fuck that bitch, commando, I will

[Intro: Kanye West]
I been waiting
For a minute
Pour out, ayy
Pour out, everyday, you know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last time I'm down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I test the code
Four times I say don't test me, ho
Told you four times don't test me, ho
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I-

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Bridge: Kanye West]
See through the night
And forget all of your past
Throw that
Throw that away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
No, love, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1]
Nighttime is sweet when I’m by your side
Drifting asleep as the train blows by
Wondering how in the hell I’d survive
Without you loving me every day of my life

[Chorus]
Every little thing you do
Is still driving me so wild I can’t think what’s left do
I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Take me away to a place so far
Riding on a train or we can take my car
Baby you know that I’m along for the ride
As long as I’m riding with you by my side

[Chorus]
Baby don’t you know it’s true
I could try to think of a million things but all I wanna do
Is keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you

[Verse 3]
Baby believe me, I’ve been feeling so high and I never wanna come down
Like I’m in heaven when I’m looking out a window feeling like I’m fast asleep
Maybe I’m dreaming, but it feels so real and I never wanna find out
(Keep falling in, keep, keep, falling in)
(Keep falling in, keep, keep, falling in)

[Chorus/Outro]
Every little thing you do is still driving me so wild
I can’t think what’s left do
I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
There’s something still and so surreal about the night that sometimes I wish it all away
Before my eyes I see a flicker of light that comes close as it echoes in the air
Did you hear me crying out?

[Chorus]
Don’t you forget about me now
Don’t you forget about me now

[Verse 2]
I find myself among the thick of it all and slowly start creeping toward the edge
Tip my hat and try to face it head-on but the cows make the cowboys in the end
You can hear them singing out

[Chorus]
Don’t you forget about me now
Don’t you forget about me now

[Verse 1]
Late afternoon turning into a late night
Newest illusion submit in the moonlight
Such a lonely little boogie that’ll last me ‘till the morning
Now that nobody’s home and I’m having a good time

[Chorus]
I’m in my own head now and finding my way out so
Don’t tie me up I’m cutting it off
Running my luck I took the day off

[Verse 2]
Bobbing my head to a lonely reflection
Lively inside of a new conversation
Such a lovely little dream and I’m pretending to be sleeping
High again all alone and I’m jamming out so hard

[Chorus]
I’m in my own place now and finding my way out so
Don’t tie me up I’m cutting it off
Running my luck I took the day off

[Verse 1]
Tell me when it hurts 'cause I can't keep finding out
Tell me when to cry 'cause I can't keep freaking out
Just when I convinced myself I couldn't live without
Pure coincidence, it never seemed to get me down

[Chorus]
But
I'll follow in tow
I'll follow this into the darkness
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly

[Verse 2]
Tell me when the lights start shining down on all our teeth
Pull me to an open chair and I'll take a seat
The song keeps playing on when it stopped I never learned
I keep running on never knowing where to turn

[Chorus]
But
I'll never slow down
I'll follow this into the morning
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly
I'll get what I want
I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly

[Verse 1]
Who’s in the mirror there is it someone that you wanna see
Is that reflection smiling back or could it even be
Who do you know here boy is it someone that you’ve yet to meet
Some promised company’s got you tripping over your own feet

[Chorus]
Cause you’re singing all alone
And you’re dancing all alone

[Verse 2]
Are you still sleeping boy cause it’s late and now you gotta run
That big old disk up there’s still shifting all the is to was
Does it taste true enough cause it’s dripping right from your own tongue
Don’t know you’re living for the same as what you’re running from

[Chorus]
Are you finally getting all you need
Are you getting what you want at least
Cause you’re singing all alone
And you’re dancing all alone

[Chorus]
Now I’m singing all alone
And I’m dancing all alone
Now I’m singing all alone
And I’m dancing all alone

[Verse 1]
Missing every note but I never was in time to start
Singing every word even if they never rhymed at all

[Chorus]
Baby turn it up I’m addicted to this song I said
Slowly fading out but awake in time to see you turn around and say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Falling off the bone but I’m cutting it too close again
Ripe red wine but I’m drinking from the hose again

[Chorus]
Barely on my mind but sometimes I feel you there with me
Hanging on the side when I turn all I see is just a shadow walking down the street

[Verse 3]
Making up my mind just in time to watch it all unfold
Feels like such a crime ain’t that just the way it always goes

[Chorus]
Play it back again swore this time there’d be a different end
Playing me out as I turn slowly take a bow
Barely even see the crowd
And you’re barely even on my mind
I don't think people necessarily understand what happened last week with the Make America Great Again hat. What are you trying to do with the message you're sending?

It was really just my subconscious. It was a feeling I had, you know like, people, we're taught how to feel. We're taught how to think. We don't know how to think for ourselves. We don't know how to feel for ourselves. People say feel free, but they don't really want us to feel free. And, uh, I felt a freedom in first of all, just doing something that everybody tells you not to do.

...

I just love Trump! That's my boy! You know like, so many rappers, you'll look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump, but then he get into office and now they don't love him. Trump is one of rap's favorite people right?

But we talked about this, that before he was elected president, people in hip-hop it was an in thing to put Donald Trump in your rhymes somewhere.

And by the way, I'm in hip-hop but I'm not just in hip-hop. I'm a black person in the black community but I'm not just that. I feel like one thing is that people try to minimize me to artist, hip-hop, black community...Yeah, I'm always gonna represent that but I also represent the world.

...

You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sound like a choice! 

[laughs]. You was there for 400 years and it was all of y'all?

It's like we're mentally imprisoned. I like the word 'prison', because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It's like slavery Holocaust, Holocaust Jews, slavery is blacks...So prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. That we're the human race.Do you feel that I'm being free? And that I'm thinking free?

[Van Lathan]
I actually don't think that you're thinking anything. I think what you're doing right now is actually the absence of thought. And the reason why I feel like that is because Kanye, you're entitled to your opinion, you're entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact, and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said.
While you are making music, and being an artist, and living the life that you've earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years that you said, for our people was a choice!

Frankly, I'm disappointed. I'm appalled. And brother, I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that's not real.
we need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain

to make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will

My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved

They cut out our tongues so we couldn't communicate to each other.  I will not allow my tongue to be cut

Kanye vs the media is modern day Willie Linch theory.

they hung the most powerful in order to force fear into the others.

they can no longer stop our voice.

the Nat Turner movie never made it anywhere because it showed slaves revolting. I understand why my god brother Puff calls his network revolt.

if this was 148 years ago I would have been more like Harriet or Nat

the universe has a plan. I knew that TMZ would be awesome.

we are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation.
the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought        It was just an idea

once again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas

in school we need to learn how magic Johnson built his business not always about the past. Matter fact I've never even heard of a high school class that presents future ideas

when the media masses and scholars talk about what started today. Here's a title ...

the overground hell road

I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves. - Harriet Tubman

[Cristiano Tweet]

[Verse 1: Phoebe Bridgers]
Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

[Verse 2]
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers & Noah Gundersen]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3: Noah Gundersen]
But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

[Verse 4: Noah Gundersen & Phoebe Bridgers]
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

[Chorus 2: Phoebe Bridgers & Noah Gundersen]
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 1: Noah Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Just a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger
No shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight

[Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, Noah Gundersen & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Verse 3: Noah Gundersen]
Hoping that you like, that you like how you're living
Relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
How many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?
How many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?

[Chorus: Noah Gundersen, Phoebe Bridgers & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Break: Noah Gundersen, Phoebe Bridgers & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes
Choking like a dog, like a dog
Open up your mouth
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Chorus: Noah Gundersen, Phoebe Bridgers & Abby Gundersen]
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Skepta]
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
{Pre-Chorus}
(Los Angeles girls, Los Angeles girls
I ever need you, and you be on my brain
Yeah)

{Chorus}
Los Angeles girls , They be trapping in my hood
They be going for my wood, And they made me understood
That these girls are all lying, And they love it when your dying
Keep you talkin till you tryin, When your close they leave you crying (Its all fake tho)
Why she coming on so slow? Why she dont wanna go?
Hanging with the rest I’m like a ghost
I go insane, She in my brain
She must be tamed, it ain’t my job, but I’m in love

And that’s a curse and it hurts
They say it’s better for the worst
I am around her she gone flirt

My money be going down
Give it all to her she proud
Think she got me feeling sound
Now the people make you think that the money is insane
And it keeps you in your lane, and it makes you start to gain
But once the racks started coming in i felt the same
That i was empty all inside (all inside)

And I put the Wraith in park and ran right up the stairs
Got inside the studio and started diggin in my hair
Tryna find the best lines to make all of this be fair
Yeah I’m pretty fortunate but the victories ain’t there

I wanna live right now
And I’m tired of the pain, they be hittin me right now
She down to hang right now
Right after i glowed up and the $’s comin in right now

And now I’m flying
I see you lying
Don’t mess with me not more
Please no

{Pre- Chorus}
(Los Angeles girls, Los Angeles girls
I ever need you, and you be on my brain
Yeah)

{Chorus}
Los Angeles girls , They be trapping in my hood

Why she coming on so slow? Why she dont wanna go?
Hanging with the rest I’m like a ghost
I go insane, She in my brain
She must be tamed, it ain’t my job, but I’m in love

[Outro]
God bless you guys
Come on thank you so much
Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey

American flags; blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing, the crowd is screaming

I used to think I was the Maharaja
Ah, oh

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone

Not of this world, hey, yeah, yeah
Not of this world, hey, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Fresh from the shore
Blonde hair is wide
The ocean makes me cry

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man

[Verse 2]
Tell me about Ray and his girl
Did I know Ray is going to meet you?
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man

One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone

All praises to the power
Oh, yeah

Praise Him by the way you live
Praise Him even when you dance and make romance
When you make romance

Praise Him for the sunlighted sky

Praise Him with a mighty soul
Praise Him without money to go
Praise Him by the words we speak
You'll be happy when you see, baby

The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say

There are songs from wisdom
There are songs from satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'

There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane

Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side
Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, lookin' good
Dance, baby, to the light

Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing

Songs we're meant to listen to
You're checkin' out the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test

Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed

Maybe you learn from me
Not to command out in the rain
If we don't get it together
Honey, right here is where we remain

Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesy a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster
The Devil has his special plan
To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners

Hey, did you know
Some songs can corrupt your flesh to dust
The only song you should live
Are songs that you can trust
The artist pays the price
Wooh!

The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only you would listen
To what he has to say

There are songs of wisdom
There are songs of satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'

There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane

Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side
Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, you're lookin' good
Dance, baby, on the right

Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing

Songs we're meant to listen to
Listen to the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
To help us pass the test

Oh, life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up with the Lord
A thousand bodies
But the soul is never destroyed

Maybe learn from me, baby
Not to the man out in the rain
We gotta get ourselves together
Or honey right here is where we remain

Your love, your love, baby, this is all I desire
And if you really understand me, baby then help me fan my fire
Sometimes a song can prophesy a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster
The Devil has his special kind
To make hot songs for sinners
Then God will turn it around
And make good songs for winners

You know that songs can make you wicked
Corrupt your flesh to dust
You know the songs that you should love
Are songs that you can trust
Owwwww!
Owwwww!
I can't stand it, baby!
There's no reason why we should part

[Repeats in background]
(Heart... Beat... Heart... Beat)
If you let me girl (Feels so good, jammin' is fun)
I'll be good to you (Got me wonderin' if I'm gonna be the one)
I will hug and kiss you  (Way you dance, look so nice)
Tenderly (being with you is paradise)

If you let me (I'm wonderin' if you're wonderin' too)
I'll be good to you (About a lifetime, me and you)
I will hug and kiss you (I'd like to see you everyday)
Tenderly (I love you, girl, in every way)

Baby (Feels so good holding your hand)
Got me wondering if I'm gonna be your man
Got my heart racing wild
Surely I love you honey child

You've come to take away the rain
The sun inside me shines again
So if you go I'm out of luck
I've really got to have you, baby
Funk me
Funk me
Funk me, funk me
Funk me

I need us for me to love
Mother nature taught me love
Love is all that I can see
Let's make love a cup of tea
We don't really have to freak
You just thrill me when you speak
I can see that you're a star
And I like the way you are
There's no need for us to stall
Come, let's answer nature's call
Funky music lights my fire
Shakes my body, sexified
Girl, we both have lots of love
Send some loving up above
Don't give me no advice
See the love that's in my eyes

All I know is how much I want you, baby
Oooh, I'm really crazy about you, girl
And darling I'd like to love you, right now, right now, right now
Forevermore, baby!
Watching you out here dancing on the floor, baby
Makes me want to love you all the more, baby
For when, little darling, we begin
I know my love for you will never, never end
Ah baby
Darling, please give me a chance
To prove in advance
I don't know if I can go on without having you for my own

Oh, father above
Give me this lady for me to love
So that I can love her right now
Ooooh, all of my love is for you to share
I will take you, darling, anywhere
I wanna love you right now, really, really

[Repeats]
I'd like to make love to you (funk me, funk me baby)
I'd like to make love with you (funk me, funk me, funk me baby)

I'd like to make love to you baby, right now
I'd like to make love to you darling, right now

I'm manifesting ("My dream")

[Verse 1]
30 years back on the scuffle with 'em weapons
Hunger in the aisle, we can roll in a second
In the real 

[? 0:17], you must be respected
One way in the entrance is the exit
You ain't getting out unless you wreck shit
Bullies'n'Black hoodies, man, you ain't have to be in some next shit
Every other person had a knife or a box cutter
Every other song you heard ("WHAT MOTHERFUCKER?")
This is where I grew up at, with my first songs blew up that
Where I first got my new crown gap, but you know that
It's just every once in a while, you do go back

[Bridge]
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")

[Verse 2]
I'm manifesting
My team, my mean, my scene, my dreams
No sleep in the hood, 

[1:08 ?]
This scene's my dreams with dreams just dreams
In 1985, my means were so lean
Rappers back then were so crisp and clean
How can I ever be heard or even just seen
I'm 

[1:21 ?], no money, nose's runny, funny
But, indeed, knowledge reigns even when it's sunny
Just when I thought my dream hadn't stopped
In-walk DJ 

[1:29 ?]
Just when I thought my dream hadn't finished
Teddy Ted's special case said ("Let's spin this!")
Just when I thought that I couldn't build there
My visions and my dreams were fulfilled right there
I told you, we'll be here forever if we're still here

[Bridge]
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")

[Verse 3]
See it in your mind's eye
Take your vision high, high
Worry 'bout no wise guy
Telling you, you can't fly
They're living a lie, lie
Telling people blah, blah
All they do is cry, cry
So when they cry, why stop
Turn up the 

[2:20 ?]
Never be a shy guy
Sail on the deck of your intellectual eye, eye
Captain, help your own destiny
Your dream is like hearing this song
It was meant to be
Like this is the vision you was meant to see
Don't be scared, get prepared, now you see
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it

Shit, do something
Do something

Would you please touch it, touch it?
Could you please kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
Baby, do something

Ridin' around, blowin' so much dope, but I'm always handlin' business
Way too high, don't pick up my phone, if I do, I'm like "Who is this?"
Ain't got time for a girlfriend, tellin' that bitch I ain't got no feelings
Young nigga straight from the bottom, now my car ain't got no ceilin'
Young nigga stackin' up millions, y'all niggas actin' like children
Ooh, nigga couldn't, used to get in, now I'm ownin' the buildin'
Brought the bitch to my crib, said she felt like she went on a field trip
Nigga like me gon' always stack, when I'm older, I'm probably gon' still get

Baby, I'm a rich-ass nigga, never said I was gon' be easy to deal with

But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm a country-ass Beverly Hillbilly
Eat it up, bitch, I'm a meal ticket
Flush it down concert, like, "Fuck a ticket"
Rich-ass, crazy-ass, super picky
Want a rich dick? Say I'm bucket-listed
I don't fuck broke, I got a boujee dick
First round draft, I'm a lottery pick
Pepped up, East Atlanta vitamins shit
Solitaires glarin', big stone like Sharon

Fuck that nigga, he a real sucker
It's the Wiz and the Wizop

Pull up outside, yeah, I might
Love it when you suck it, lowkey, like it when you bite
You keep doin' good and I'ma do you in Dubai
Fuck it, got a ticket, have her flyin' through the sky
Dials on my wristwatch, it don't tick tock
Sellin' dope to get it, you gon' need a big block
She ain't top ten, she can get the liplock
But she bad enough to stuff it in the Ziploc
Put it on the side, I didn't notice
Know you got that flower bomb like a lotus
You about that action, yeah, I know
But can you get it from the tip top? Head in my flip flops

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Baby, you the realest one afterall
I know what your body sayin', we don't have to talk
Doorman know your name, he don't have to call
Focus on your brain with no Adderall
I be runnin' through your lane like it's basketball
When I knock your body down, don't you waterfall
Take out the noosebleeds, put you where you 'sposed to be
Girl, you been so far away, I just need you close to me
If my name on her thang, everybody know it's me
I can't even roll in peace, everybody know it's me
Jesus piece, Rosary, I could see heavenly
Get'cha bustin' like heavy artillery
And it's music to my ears, auxillary
Put your legs in the air if you feelin' me

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hunnid bags when I'm walkin' out the mall
She said, "Daddy, can you show me how to ball?"
She gon' give me gooshy gooshy in my flipflops
Your bitch on my arm like a wristwatch

Throat leakin' on drip drop
Tell your nig', say aight, pull them panties to the side
To the left, to the right, show you right
That was tight, yeah, I like, do that shit I like
Yeah, I like, do that shit I like

[Verse 1: Shane Blanchard & Pablo Sotelo]
Why has it stopped, is she really not there
He's alone
(Wish that I could call you on the phone)
I'm awake and aware but it's out of my hair
Where she goes?

[Chorus: Shane Blanchard & Pablo Sotelo]
Somethings are made to last a while
Either stay or watch it go
Keep me in mind when you're away
I knew it
I'll see you on another day

[Bridge: Pablo Sotelo]
Dreams of another soul, I'm living a different life
The path can cross, the path can change
And now back to later maybe we can get together
Now back to later maybe we can get together
Now back to later maybe we can get together
Now back to later maybe we can get together
Now back to later maybe

[Chorus: Shane Blanchard & Pablo Sotelo]
Somethings are made to last a while
Either stay or watch it go
Keep me in mind when you're away
I knew it
I'll see you on another day

[Intro: Young Thug]
My nigga Wheezy, you know what I'm sayin'

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
These hoes going 'round like a ceiling fan
I might pull up in that pink coat like Killa Cam
In high school, had them black eye peas like ​will.i.am
This bitch suck every season like the L.A. Rams (Suck it)
Used to cop from the flea market from Mr. Chan
Bossed up, now them diamonds in my hand (Yeah)

Niggas biting and they still popping they 

[?]
I'm the same nigga, ain't shit change nigga
Dark ass tints and wood grain, nigga

And I fuck with Chicago, boy R.I.P LA

Thinkin' this shit sweet gon' run me back to my old ways (Pussy)
Call them savage niggas who gon' shoot you for some J's
And the bitch rub me like Genie
And I'm doing shows in arenas

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Take away your things and go
Can't take back what you said, oh no
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rihanna]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
So I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Rihanna]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, oh

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Bridge: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yup, yup
30, you a fool for this one

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Broke niggas still talkin' the loudest
When you doing bad, niggas the proudest
Need a deposit before the private
Too exclusive, you can't talk to my manager
AK chopstick, cock it back and I damage her
Back in high school had a bitch out in Banneker
Talkin' bout Stephanie used to 

[?] selling act to the felonies
I fuck 

[?] caucasian, ebony, indian, cinnamon
"Ain't fucking, come again", never heard that before
Bitch off the X she bout high as a acrophobia
Geeked off the shrooms, she swear she seen a UFO
Brother had bricks like an old house chimney
Walk in the crib, that's the gang house reminy
Back in college I was fairly odd like Timothy
Now I blew up like you mixed the wrong thing in chemistry
And I give a fuck if you into me, fuck the industry
These niggas fake, my young niggas slimeball with the drake Niggas said you sweet as hell like you cake
Eat it up, eat it up off the plate, nigga
And I been poppin' and these niggas got animosity
I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins
Got a stupid bitch, she like doing pills, call her Mary Poppins
I could give a fuck bout a rap nigga
I could give a fuck about a pump, pump, pump it up old ass rap nigga
Talking about how it ain't gon' last for a nigga
Just to keep it real, I made more money in the last two than you ever did
I'ma stay down with the same gang
...

[?] taste like kiwi
And I spent the guap on GP
Lil' Boat

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
What!
Huh, lemme talk my shit, huh
Lil' bitch, don't play with me niggas, they violent (lil' bitch!)
My shooter ain't talking, he silent (grrah)
I'm thinking 'bout buying a island
Ooh, I just bought the Maybach, I'm wildin' (ooh, yeah)
Nah,

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

Ooh, my love, love, love, love
Oh, don't go, go, go, go
Don't go, go, go, go

[Verse 1]
You know it wasn't over when I said I'm gone
I came right back to you, I
Wasn't over when I wanted
'Cause I ran back to you, yeah, right back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I had enough when I said I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Ooh, and I said I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
But I don't

[Chorus]
Ooh, I know, know, know, know
Ooh, don't grow, grow, grow, grow
Ooh, my love, love, love, love
Oh, don't go, go, go, go
Don't go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Tell me what I want to hear, make it crystal clear
Why you bringing out my fears, bringing out the tears?
The only love I'll ever know is walking down that road
Doin' all my fuckin' worst

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I had enough when I said I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Ooh, and I said I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
But I don't

[Chorus]
Ooh, I know, know, know, know
Ooh, don't grow, grow, grow, grow
Ooh, my love, love, love, love
Oh, don't go, go, go, go
Don't go, go, go, go

[Intro]
Good job, 1st

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I just bought a new chain, I never change up
And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

[Verse 1]
And your bitch is so fly, ain't got no propeller
I been leakin' water, and it's no propeller
Never planned to ball, but I got my bread up
When I'm ballin', so wet, you need a umbrella, ayy
I'm too young to be in the club, ho
I ain't tryna step on no, no toes
Diamonds flashin' like they takin' photos
Every single jaw drop when I walk through

[Chorus]
Tryna maintain, and get my paper
I just bought a new chain, I get the check up
And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
Just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper

[Verse 2]
And we pourin' champagne on your bitch
We be countin' money while we get lit
I'm just countin' up 'til I'm rich, yeah
Ayy, I'm just throwin' bands where my wrist is
I be throwin' up bands 'til I get sick
And I'm watchin' money fall from the ceilin'
Everything that I say, I don't mean it, hey
I don't even wanna touch you bitch
They don't get paid like I do
Swervin' in the car, 4-2
I just got a bottle and I got my money
We gon' go for bottle, come on, come on

[Chorus]
Tryna maintain, and get my paper
I just bought a new chain, I get the check up
And I'm rockin' Balmains and I got Margiela
And I step in on the saw, bitch, I got out better

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
Just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper
I'm just tryna maintain, and get my paper

[Outro]
Oh, hello, hello
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Wanna play, I do
Mm, mm, mm

[Verse]
I'm cancerous
So when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your freakin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
‘Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get laid
More than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her freakin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the hell can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Verse 1]
Now when I say 2-0, you say
Nah, you know the rest
This is our scene
Our music, our movement, the history lives through us
I write to the beat and let life play the guitar strings
Despite the drama, there's respect and camaraderie
Every time one of my friends is mentioned in My Philosophy
It's a rite of passage, I'm not trying to be corny
I got love for Sportn' Life, Alpha P, Massline, and Onry
Every time somebody steps out on the road
They bring a little Northwest soul with them, amen
Alright then, just so you know
I try to carry that every time that I rock a show
So, turn my sound up
Ricochet off our mountain
It's Good Medicine that Chief Sealth would've been proud of
Sends our city, town pride, heart, blood, sweat, tears, I-5
North, Southside, vibe, live, ride down these city blocks
And never will be stopped
They tryin' to shut down the clubs that my city rocks
Now Mr. Mayor why would you enforce an ordinance?
Music it saves lives, these kids out here are supporting it
And through the art form, we've learned the importance of community
Truth to the youth so they know what's up
Yup, and as a public school student
I learned from my teachers but became through my music
Take that away, that's a vital
14 Fathoms Deep, Do the Math, Tribal
My greatest teachers: B-Self and Vita
Wordsayer was my mayor and things have changed
But I carry the torch and what I do with that flame
Is lit every time that I step on the stage
The skyline is etched in my veins
You can never put that out, no matter how hard it rains
For my city

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
That's right, when you put on a show
And watch the people seat in between the creases and the doors
Hitting up Meli or sneakin' in cause they're broke
Not leaving in between sets because of needin' to smoke
The reason being whatever
The scene from Beacon to Everett
Is in need of less ego when we kick it, alright?
I get on stage, style, share my whole life
Try to reach 'em at the bar where they're drinkin' Miller Lite
But the kids in the front, they bring out the passion, dude
Make noise throughout the show and not only when we ask 'em to
I watch the older cats jaded in the back
Hands clasped, forgot when they weren't too cool to be a fan, damn
Hatin' at the concert
You don't remember RKCNDY, watching Heiro, or vibing out to Alkaholiks
I know it's not the same, it never will be
But my, my, my, my city's filthy
And we've been truly dope
Since Supreme was up on Broadway in the dookie rope
Mean muggin' in Sir Mixalot's video
Back when Scene was rockin' house parties on the floor
JMG's, Sit N' Spin, and The Paradox
Back when Marc introduced Geo to Sabz
So much has changed here, so much has not
I was just a kid hopin' I could earn my spot
Try to get some props
Meet a promoter who'll give me a shot
To let me get up on stage and get the crowd to rock
Read a page out my notebook
What I thought would be respected, they would connect with it
Now lookin' over the city's the only thing that keeps me calm
Scattered thoughts jotted down by this pen in my palm
It's like my city stands still, the world looks on
If I could only capture its beauty and put it in a song

[Outro]

[Intro]
Alright, look
There’s a song on my album
Called youforia
And
And ima do that

I’m not as a good of a singer as Tay is
But... you know I like to do it

[Verse]
Said, said, said
I been waiting so long
To have you by my side
And I, I can't do no wrong
With you by my side

[Chorus]
Youphoria
Youphoria

[Verse]
And when you, you lay in my arms
The pain goes away
Baby you, you feel so damn good
Just come take my hand
And we could go to the moon
Look at my eyes as we land

[Chorus]
Youphoria
Youphoria
Youphoria

[Verse]
And when you, you look in my eyes
The pain goes away

[Chorus]
Youphoria
Youphoria
Youphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Youphoria
Youphoria
Youphoria
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Youphoria

[Outro]
And when you're mine
I won't let you go
No, the pain, it can't stay
Euphoria

[Ending]
Thank you
Thank you everybody
Los Angeles California thank you!

[Intro]
Um
Shall we, uh
Take them to, uh, church?

[Verse 1]
People worship these idols, 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die
Let's go!
Think it's time for a revolution, me and my dawgs 'bout to start a riot
Still they sleeping when I'm eating, you and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement, intelligent but we going stupid
This some new shit, hit the strip club
See some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis, bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music, get this money, share the profits
Now this class getting led by students
Smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground
They didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money I'm hunting it down
Planting the seeds, working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money
I'll always be straight, I just thought you should know
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'mma be fine, no matter the time, we all go along with the show

[Hook]
That girl beautiful, somebody introduce me
She ain't your girl tonight, nah, that bitch a groupie
That's money in my building better...
I see you starin' at me like you in the movies
Now you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies

[Verse 2]
People worship these idols, 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get---
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you---
When I die!
Let's go!
Fuck a--- got ya bitch here in just a tank top
Getting paid, roll my face off, bitch you're bank fraud, Bernie Madoff
Educate y'all then erase y'all, LL Cool J without the Kangol
I don't see the need to stunt, wish you the best, I'mma just light up this blunt
This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, thats a lot of bookings
My bitches gorgeous, looking imported from the---
Coming from out of the 'Burgh
Bitch, I'm absurd, fuck you, I hope you insured
Hating? I'll give you just what you deserve
That's my word, put it on all that I'm worth
Been on my grind, taking what's mine, I got my eyes on the throne
I'mma be fine---

[Hook]
Fuck that we watchin' movies
Now you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies

[Outro]
Cause you know

Salt Lake City put your hand real high in the air one time
Woo!

Now you watching movies
Now you watching movies
Now you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies

[Intro]
This next song right here is a song called REMember, alright?
It's dedicated to a homie of mine
Let's go

[Verse 1]
I said, I hope you're proud of me, dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
I admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you but
This life moves fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now, I need to run to any place with a train stop
And everybody wanna talk to me
About some business shit
Never really listening
Couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
Hate, sound the same
When my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)
Y'all holding up the lighters, I appreciate y'all man
Light up the sky for me again

[Hook]
Said I remember when we were just kids, woah-oh-oh-oh
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in West Virginia
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Said it's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go? He was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gone by by then
I said
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need
Multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place
Where the time don't end
So you don't need money
All you got is time to spend, I'm saying
Life is short, don't ever question it's length and
It's cool to cry
Don't ever question your strengths, said
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

[Bridge]
Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
So when the world's looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

[Hook: Mac & Tay Walker]
Said I remember when we were just kids woah-oh-oh
Y'all take one hand and put it real high in the air like this
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in...

Said I remember when we were just kids woah-oh-oh-oh
We knew nothing at all, we'd talk about this life we lived
In West Virginia, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

[Intro: Mac Miller]
This next song one of my favorite to perform its called The Question, alright

Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
Sometimes I wonder

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Sometimes I wonder who the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?
I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

[Hook: Mac Miller]
What am I doing here?
I wanna know I wanna know
What am I doing here
Said, What am I doing here
Said, What am I doing here

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth?
Cause everybody say they have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you can never do too much if you don't ever do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical

What I need yall to do put two hands in the air
We gon' go slow side to side

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Said, what am I doing here?
What am I doing here
Woah, what am I doing here
Said, what am I doing here

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro: Mac Miller & Mac Miller and Tay Walker]
Now one time look before we do this song right here
Before we do this song
Alirght, you gotta say: God damn!
God Damn! (repeat a lot of times)

[Intro: Mac Miller & Syd]
Some people people, woah oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Some people people, people people, people people, people people, people people, people ohh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Said, people love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking 'bout her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly, said
What would I have to do to call you mine, said
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free, said
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend, said
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Hook: Mac Miller With Syd]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free
Once, baby, you and me
I said, Salt Lake City put your hands in the air like this
And never come back again
And leave it all in the rear view, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear view, girl
Siad, you don't have to cry
*humming*

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Can you, can you
Mend a broken heart girl if you can, said
Don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please, give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable, said
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't a need to go and kill yourself, though
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all, yeah
I wish the truth would just reveal itself, said
Who do you call to make it to the top
And who do you call to make the shooting stop
And who do you call to give the coup a wash?
After everything I did I think I'm still myself

[Hook: Mac Miller With Syd]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange, how the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free
Once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
Towards the air like this, let's go
Leave it all in the rear view
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear view, yeah oh-oh-oh
It's in the rear view
Said, you don't have to cry
*humming*

[Outro: Mac Miller & Syd]
Said, thanks y'all for coming out tonight
I hope you get home alright
I'm sorry we kept y'all waitin'
But this has been the Space Migration
And if you want to leave, said
Right there's the door
But if you stick around for just another minute\we might have a little bit more
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh-oh

[End: Tay Walker]
Girl it's only you
Have it your way
If you want you can decide
And if you'll have me I can provide everything you can desire

T: Alright I’m just playin here you go bro

Mac: Wait Wait Wait hit the ho- wait wait
Tay Tay Tay why you singin’ in the shadows baby?
Hit the hook one time, hit the hook one time

Tay:
I said I said I said
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel, yeah

Mac:
That’s right baby!
That was fucking tight
We never practiced that
That was good for no practice

[Verse 1]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, but she's still shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself, says her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
She's fooling everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

[Verse 2]
The night descends and there goes Carmen
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
The men, they stop when she walks by 'em
Whisper, "Who is she?"
La princesa de la silence
Her walk is art, her words are lightnin'
Strikin' everyone when she pass by them

[Chorus]
Carmen, darlin', doesn't have a problem
She's lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
She's foolin' everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

[Bridge]
She looks animated like a cartoon baby
With her tiara smile and her shortcake heart
Yo, she looks animated like a cartoon baby
With her champagne signs and her cocaine heart
She's like a light but you can't turn off
You’re getting too bright and you need to stop
But you can’t tonight and you're gettin' hot
And your body keeps twistin', movin', twistin', movin', shakin', yeah
Twistin', movin', shakin', yeah
Dance 'til dawn, yeah, you dance 'til you drop

[Chorus]
Carmen, Carmen, doesn’t have a problem
Lying to herself ’cause her liquor’s top shelf
It's alarming, honest, how disarming she can be
You're fooling everyone
When inside they know you’re dying

[Outro]
Carmen, Carmen, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf

[Verse 1]
It was dawn and I
Waited on the filter
So to typify
Said she called me mister
Under misty skies
Hit to get there quicker
Rebel through the night
'Cuz I truly missed her
Universal charm
'Cuz she thinks it’s humour
And I mean no harm
Lie down into this
Fall back she says
Let’s just keep this mutual
It’s these lines I dread
Too much life force simple

[Verse 2]
As the night awaits
I can see her sleeping
Stare down mistake
Does she know my secret?
I’m in love with her
Let the love manifest
Watch me take my serve
Watch me take control
She doesn’t know what hit her
Glimpses of her soul
As a seamless dinner
Numbers on the plate
It’s my turn now
One minute to the hour yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you

[Bridge]
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll t-t-tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me

Shut up

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol

Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Verse 2: Rich Brian]
Yeah
Talk every day, like we best friends
Every time we out on a date, we're engaged
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her "What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?"
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Don't give a fuck)
Well, boy, I don't give a...

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Saweetie]
Mmm
I've been winnin' since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you 'bout to get much sicker
'Cause I'm lookin' in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Bacon, baby, here's what's poppin', rich with six-plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, takin' meetings in LA
Glowin' up and blowin' up, that's what I'm 'bout to do
When it's all been happenin' since I left you

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off, I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on

Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol, so
I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off, I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Get up off your knees 'cause
Boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 4: Saweetie]
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, then I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept it hunnid, man, you shoulda kept it real
'Cause I realized you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
'Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
Cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why (I'll tell you why)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up (Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Boy, I don't give a)

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (Get to me)
Get up off your knees 'cause
Boy, I don't give a fuck

Somebody holds the key

Shawn make hustler music; Em make fight music
I make beige music; I make white music
Hype, needles inducing, how you wanna try? (Huh?)
What's your vehicle of choice? How you wanna kiss the sky?
And they protect themselves, gassing potatoes, do your facials
Get your T-zones and clean out your pores
I'm not really sure the forty makes a whole
But it removes the dead skin and exfoliates your soul, nigga (Virginia, nigga!)

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
P, I got love for you—love 'til I die
You my motherfucker (Ugh)
Make a hater cry the tears of a dove for you
Bust a couple slugs for you

Make one of the curlers cry, they world gon' fry
The only thing you seeing from my boroughs is fly
So when a nigga talk shit, don't worry 'bout it
Paramedics in his crib, had to carry him out it
Don't ever raise your voice or let your temperature rise
I got the four-five with hollow-flies into the dive
Let him rest and leave maggots in him (Maggots with him)
Let him talk about his vest, he should've had it with him (Ugh)
Had it on him, hundred, kept it with him (With him)
Had his weapons with him (yeah)
And he ain't walking alone, let's hope the Shepherd with him
Yeah, I drag him through the Valley of Death and out of a breath
His heart jump right out of his chest, but fuck him

[Outro: DJ Drama & DJ drops]
Dramatic!
See, I don't if y'all niggas know, but it's a lot going on right now
It's a lot of business moves being made off-screen
When the music stops
Skateboard P, DJ Drama

Oh yeah, we definitely eating
And I'm talking 'bout before lunchtime!

Nah, nah dude seriously, did I monster that?
Did I monster that though? It's nothin'
Uh, check it out (Gangsta Grizzil)

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Real niggas save up for out-of-state, but collect stash houses
Drive Jeep wagons taxidermy their couches
Getting small dope, fuck LV pouches
On the corner selling' that tiger, you can tell how they crouch
I've seen pictures of Jimmy Henchman when he was in jail
Fresh beeper, fresh chain, fresh sneaker detail
Like he could, order anything from hits to sales
Like he in the four seasons ordering cocktails
Real gangsta's do it, they don't have to prove it
The keys is spoken for, you don't tell 'em to move it
They operate just like sleuths
They flow, fiends and hoes as they conduits
Like the three letter crew out in ATL
Got the Feds scratching they heads sayin', "will they please tell"
The nigga Em is like the new Rayfel
With police escorts that's louder than a Ray shot sale (Uh-Huh)
And you get indicted, get your Steinberg's to fight it
He paid that way, you think he ain't gon' write it?
The feds get excited, not knowin' the con's inside it
So against the day decided before they even tried it (Gangsta)
Now back to the necessity if you gon' supply it
All your weak links, Donald Trump, and nigga you're fired
I did my research, my street exposure reworked
I was too busy drivin' in Zo's and hoes bezerk
Now remember, who got you hired?
Who both, educate and spit the shit you like?
Now analyze the picture that the non-thug drew
Sip your Corona, and puff your bud too

[Hook]
Time for the, time for the, best of the best (Time for the, time for the, best)
The new double-R drive with BBC on my chest (The new double-R driver BBC on my chest)
When you got your marked Jigga boots with the LV dress (Marked Jigga boots with the LV dress)
Yeah, well holla at the kid, yessir, nothin' less (Holla at the kid, yessir, nothin' less)

[DMX]
In the name of Jesus, let's pray
Father we thank you for this gathering of souls
See that when two or more gather in your name that you...
Wait a second
Your presence
We thank you for our lives father
We thank you for the great blessings
You've given us this day
We thank you for the air you've given us to breathe
Food you've given us to eat
Lives you've allowed us to touch
Lives that touched our own
We pray that we're able to keep these blessings to ourselves as well as other lives
We pray that any obstacle that the devil plans to place in our path be removed in the name of Jesus
We pray that every spirit that is not of you be removed
Every spirit of anger, every spirit of addiction, every spirit of jealousy, every spirit of lust, every spirit of greed
Be removed right now in the name of Jesus
Devil, we rebuke you
Seasons blow away, but the love is just the same
Each time you go away, but the love won't let me stay
Each time you go away, but the love won't hurt today
Seasons blow away, but the love still hurts the same
Seasons blow away, but the love is just the same
Each time you go away, but the love won't let me stay
Each time you go away, but the love won't hurt today
Seasons blow away, but the love still hurts the same
Seasons blow away, but the love is just the same
Each time you go away, but the love won't let me stay
There he goes again, my friend
But this will never be the end
Of the bend in the road
You will carry the load
Until your wings are sewed back on
You will be gone from here my dear
I will cheer for you from afar
Sing a song in a bar

We will always be on par
We will always be on par

And do not forget to open your eyes wide
Enjoy the ride
You sure have pried
Your soul open before
So don't you ignore the wind at your feet

And keep that heartbeat on repeat
Oh, keep that, keep that heartbeat
And keep that heartbeat on repeat
Oh, keep that, keep that heartbeat
We will always be on par
We will always be on par
We will always be on par
We will always be on par

And keep that heartbeat on repeat
Oh, keep that, keep that heartbeat
And keep that heartbeat on repeat
Oh, keep that, keep that heartbeat

[Intro]
Check, check, one, two
Yeah
Ohh, oh yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah!

[Verse 1:]
Livin' like I'm livin', tented windows on that Camino
Niggas couldn't see me, triple beamer, fuck a telescope
Photos of my baby boy, I know I know to raise him tough
"Daddy why you never home?" "You'll understand when you grow up"
Papa was a crazy fuck, paper chasing, playing drums
Momma never taught me how to save, she told me double up
Wifey need a couple bucks, side piece always wanna fuck
Life ain't never easy I can see y'all niggas giving up
See y'all niggas grilling us, see yo' bitches feeling us
These niggas ain't killing us, we been more than generous
Giving every single bit, taking everything we want
Time is of the essence, but don't put that stress up in blood
Now what the fuck is "good luck"? Everything I've ever done
Something out of nothing, killing everything in front us
Every nigga that ever fronted on us is throwing up
Chunking up the gold cup, y'all niggas is runners, huh

[Hook]
And now we only got the time that heavens deal us

You say you wanna be a part of our scene, well
You say you wanna see the killer in me, and
You say you wanna tear us up at our seams, and
You say you need to mean something to me

I thought I buried you in the ground
I thought you promised not to make a sound
I barely see you around
And I don't want you to get the wrong idea

I know you think I'm here
But I'm really not there
And it's not my fault

[Intro: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Drunk, so high, so high

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (High)
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (So high)
(High, high, high)

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Drink from me, drink from me
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (High)
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (So high)
(High, high, high)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
La, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I-Oh-I-Oh-I

So high, so high

Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot across the)
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...

[Verse 1]
It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

[Chorus]
'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is
Up in flames

[Verse 2]
It's a beautiful plan (Hmm), but I'm not concerned (Oh, yeah)
It's a beautiful game (Hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (Shut your mouth), that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (Hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

[Chorus]
'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is—

[Bridge]
I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

[Verse 3]
They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

[Outro]
It's a beautiful life

ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

All I ever wanted in my life was a sack, though

Yeah, you pourin' fours, but I know that's not Act, no
I know you not playa 'cause your bitch got your passcode

[Verse]
I brought my moms out, I'm still gon' show my ass, though

You won't smoke them shits, it's goin' down, call me Jacques, bro
Yeah, I'm a dog with a sack, bro

[?] in the condom and I can't fold
All up on my neck, it be them diamonds with the yellow gold

All I ever wanted in my life was a sack, though
Brother locked up in the county, kickin' backdoors
Yeah, you pourin' fours, but I know that's not Act, no
I know you not playa 'cause your bitch got your passcode
All I ever wanted in my life was a sack, though
Brother locked up in the county, kickin' backdoors

Stay with that yappa boy I move with that baby beam (uhh-uh)

I used to be broke now I own two Mercedes (uh-uh)
I'm good with the ladies
Have you seen my latest?
My greatest, she might be the one for my babies (uhh)
I'm trippin', I fucked then I'm dippin', wait, hold on
I act like a heathen, you send me a twelve (yeah-uh)
Better make sure it's even, no Steven, achieving
You 

[Ripley's] believing, deceiving
You thieving ass, fallin' ass niggas I'm leading, I'm breaking in
Bread for my gang, drip the swag and I'm bleeding
I'm all they believe in, I got 'em, they gibbe (yeah)
Got a new watch, that shit cost 'bout 50 times two (yeah)
Got a new truck and it's blue, pay my taxes on time (yeah)
And my credit look good like a jew, but I'm black
Runnin' around town with a sack
You gotta be kidding me, all of these niggas is pussy
I'm walking with Stussy, I'm snatching your bitch
'Cause I know you a rookie, yeah, hoo
I hang with the gang, Migo Gang stack it up like a chimney
Auto-target to my enemy, better get out my vicinity, bitch
(yeah, yeah)
Run it back-back to back-back to back like a marathon
Brother locked up sellin' gas like a Chevron
All of this ice this shit look like an avalanche
Glacier Boyz, twelve million dollars no longer civilian
I move with the pilgrims

[?] come fly with that Glock, Robbie Williams
My bitches 

[?], I need me a jet
Double o seven, I stay with the tech
Tats on my chest, ice on my neck
She fuck it though, I'm out in Buffalo
Keep that shit cool when I'm fucking on another hoe
Patek Philippe, time I got big boy Pakets and VVS diamonds
You said you the shit, but I know that you lyin'
Diamonds be spicy like cayenne pepper
Young nigga ball like Chris Webber
I need the key to my city or 

[?] or something
I walk in the spot and I got the bitch jumpin'
This bitch off of the molly, it look like she krumping
Big Bentley coupe, got the whole engine running
Talking, just like a reverend
Nigga I don't drive no Chevron

[Verse 1]
It’s everything that you seem to ignore
The classroom that you treated as a bore
The alcohol you drank but never bought
The dress you stole and were never caught

[Verse 2]
The bed you wake up in that’s not your own
The makeup you applied two days ago
The night you lost your phone on the way home
The taxi ride where you decided your end goal

[Verse 3]
And still I try to lure you into my own hurricane
It’s like you spot me trying from a thousand miles away
I look down on you so deep down I know that we’re the same
It’s stupid thinking that you would want to come play my game

[Outro]
Tell me what’s wrong
Tell me what’s wrong
Tell me what’s wrong
Tell me what’s wrong

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
So won't you, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me 'til it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh won't you, stay with me

[Bridge]
Won't you stay with me?
You're all I need
Stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?

Oh darling, stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need, yeah
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh darling, stay with me

Don't go

[Verse 1]
You make it look like it's magic (Oh yeah)
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to bein' used

[Pre-Chorus]
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it

So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

[Pre-Chorus]
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected

I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Chorus]

Girl, you earned it, yeah

[Verse 3]
On that lonely night (Lonely night)
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush (Fell in love)
It made us believe it was only us (Only us)
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, you're perfect (Girl, you're perfect)
You're always worth it (Always worth it)

Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect

You deserve it
Girl, you deserve it
Girl, you earned it, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1:]
Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have foreva
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

[Hook:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings
Your prettywings around

[Verse 2:]
I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies

I turned day into night
Sleep till I died a thousand times
I shoulda showed you
Better night better times better days
And I miss you more, and more

[Hook:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings your
Prettywings, your prettywings around
So prettywings, your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings around
Say prettywings oh prettywings, yeah
Prettywings, your (oh oh) prettywings around

[Outro]
(Ah, ah, yeah, ah/ Repeats throughout)
Prettywings your prettywings around
Yeah ay- ay - ay

Pretty, pretty, prett- tay- pretay- tay wings
Prettywings your prettywings around

[Intro]
You know, when I first heard this song
The lyrics, the melody, the way it was being sung
I said man, that's the lady I need to go out and find
A lady that will stay with you through the transition of time
The yes, the nos, the maybe sos
Come on Temptations, let's sing this song

[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking about how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
So, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
So won't you, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me 'til it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh won't you, stay with me

[Bridge]
Won't you stay with me?
You're all I need
Stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?

[Chorus]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need, yeah

Oh darling, stay with me

Lurk, don't get caught on the highway

Big dream, hella goods
My squad keep grinding for us

[Verse 1]
I know your type, think you're one in a million
Your diamonds are fake, you ain't golden
But I only fuck with the ones who are rare enough
Real enough, down to keep goin'
It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm goin' all in, I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up and stunt with your clique (Clique)
Glacier all up on your wrist (Wrist)
Think you're the sickest like you got diseases
But you ain't got nothing on this
I can see you talk, got a big mouth (Blah, blah, blah, blah)
Would you stick around for the comedown? (Come down, yeah!)
24/7, I'm 365
Wait for me heaven, I'm here 'til I die
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I'm goin' all in (All in)

It's 5 in the mornin', yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm in my element every day
Birthday cake, you want a piece 'cause it's tasty
We on a roll, we don't stop 'til the bottles all popped
And the pills got me wasted
It's 5 in the mornin' and I'm goin' all in
I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up and stunt with your clique (Clique)
Glacier all up on your wrist (Wrist)
Think you're the sickest like you got diseases

[Intro]
Break out your fuckin' swishas
Light up your fuckin' weed
I'd like to introduce you all to The Chronic III
It's D R period Dre motherfucka
Back to set the record straight for motherfuckers

[Verse 1]
I gotta be the number one supplier
I keep you higher than Richard Pryor
I been the dope man since '86 ('86)
From a nigga with a attitude to a nigga that's fuckin' rich
I'm feeling better than I've ever been
A lot stronger, plus I got a bet I win (bet I win)
I'm takin' all bets, fuck it I'm all in
And when I'm finished with this business I will be number
(one, one, one)
Started out on the turn tables, but look how the tables turned
You can't imagine what my label earned
I gross more in a year than most niggas make in their whole career
I'm only here (two, two, two) make sure I shake up your rear view
And you niggas could not see me with a clear view
If I was you I'd probably hate me too
'Cause yeah you got a budget but you can't fit Dre in it
It's (three) album solo, the Aftermath logo
Platinum plus 'cause I don't go gold, you know
My stats, ain't got enough wall for all my plaques
Niggas actin' like I wasn't comin' back
(Four) more, I'm too in love with this shit, plus I came too far to quit
And it was in nine (five) I got sick of niggas trippin' and shit
So I started building my label, sometime in 9 (six)
Adjust the levels on my mic so it's loud and clear (testin')
This is something that I want the whole world to hear (world to hear)
(Seven) I'm tired of niggas blamin' sales on the industry
The music ain't shit, and personally it's offendin' me

[Chorus]
Twelve steps to recovery

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' with the D-R, find yourself an E-R
Need C-P-R, do you know who we are?
Love cognac and cigars, so high I don't see y'all
On a whole 'nother level, that's why I couldn't be y'all
(Eight) straight summers they've been patiently waitin'
And I-, I'd like to thank you all for being patient
I-, I'd like to shout out all the critics for hatin'
'Cause you've only been the fuel for my motivation
(Nine) you cat's lives is limited
While I got black cards for all of my businesses
And there's (ten) million reasons why you can't fuck with Detox
And I'm the biggest influence in hip-hop
(Eleven) I can't stop (can't stop), look what I started (thanks to hip-hop)
I get the most pay, because I work the hardest
(Twelve) "Should've been Number 1 to me"
It's hard work to you, but it's fun for me

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Bad Blood]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Blood]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2: Bad Blood]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Blood]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood

[Chorus: Should've Said No]
You should've said, "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge: Bad Blood]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus: Bad Blood]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1: Long Live]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus 1: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge 1: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground

[Verse 2: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 2: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus 3: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge 2: New Year's Day]
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 4: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus 2: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

[Outro: Long Live & New Year's Day]
And long live (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
And long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you

[Chorus]
You know that you're my girl
And I love it, babe, but I wanna know
Not in my ride, in my bed
But I wanna know
I wanna know, babe, tell me if it's real, if it's real
You a warrior in that battlefield, battlefield
Steady green like it's cabbage deals, cabbage deal
Why? Why? Yeah

[Post-Chorus 1]
Tell me why, why, why you still rushin', baby? I wanna know
Ain't got nothin' to hide or disguise
It's all on the table, baby, just lettin' you know
I'm a warrior with a killin' skill
Most of these monkey niggas greener than a dollar bill, dollar bill
Continuously askin' the same questions like, "Why? Why?"

[Pre-Verse]
I'm on house arrest, but it's the rich one
Diamonds on my ankles, I'm slightly skatin', yeah
Ooh, a trillion like wow, wow

[Verse]
Just a billion-dollar baby with a trillion-dollar baby
I'm in a rush, baby, stay there
Make one move, I'll do mayhem, yeah
Niggas targeting us black men, yeah
I can see you on the spycam
Police brutality at any cop camps
Shoot you a hunnid times, can't tell if you a man or ma'am

[Chorus]
You know that you're my girl
And I love it, babe, but I wanna know
Not in my ride, in my bed
But I wanna know
I wanna know, babe, tell me if it's real, if it's real
You a warrior in that battlefield, battlefield
Steady green like it's cabbage deals, cabbage deal
Why? Why? Yeah

[Post-Chorus 2]
You've got a look in your eyes
I can tell somethin' wrong but you still won't let me know
'Ya tears racin' from the front and the side, oh, baby, I wanna know
Is you a warrior with a killer skill?
Most of these monkey niggas greener than a dollar bill, dollar bill
Continuously askin' the same questions like, "Why? Why?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, hah, ooh, whose luck is down?
You've been dropped, don't look down
Ooh, tonight, yeah, all, all night

[Chorus]
You know that you're my girl
And I love it, babe, but I wanna know
Not in my ride, in my bed
But I wanna know
I wanna know, babe, tell me if it's real, if it's real
You a warrior in that battlefield, battlefield
Steady green like it's cabbage deals, cabbage deal
Why? Why? Yeah

[Post-Chorus 1]
Tell me why, why, why you still rushin', baby? I wanna know
Ain't got nothin' to hide or disguise
It's all on the table, baby, just lettin' you know
I'm a warrior with a killin' skill
Most of these monkey niggas greener than a dollar bill, dollar bill
Continuously askin' the same questions like, "Why? Why?"

[Intro]
I never trust a narcissist
Oh but they love me...
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy...
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about...
...me...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Verse]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
It just felt so good

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
And it's just for fun
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got pitchforks and proof, they don't need their reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up ohh
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up...

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh

[Chorus 1: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh
Ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh—ooh

[Transition: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things & We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]
Oh, and here's to my real friends
Oh, and here's to my baby
They didn't care about the he-said-she-said
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Verse 1: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus 1: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady

[Bridge: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said-she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away (And here's to my baby)
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (He didn't care about that he-said-she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah...

[Verse 1]
I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

[Chorus]
But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

[Verse 2]
Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

[Chorus]
'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

[Bridge]
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

[Chorus]
Yeah, if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

[Outro]
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Carter]
I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All]
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

[Chorus: All]
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got

[Verse 2: AJ McLean]
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: All]
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
(What love's supposed to do)
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do

[Chorus: All]
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got

[Bridge: Nick Carter]
I've been broken, I've been bruised
But now I'm all in 'cause of you
So if you're gonna love me, love me right, yeah
But if you're gonna be someone that hurts somebody just for fun
Then do it to a heart that isn't mine

[Chorus: All]
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart (Woo)
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart (Don't, don't, don't)
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Yeah)
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Yeah)
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
It's the only one, it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Got, oh)
Baby, don't go

[Chorus]
Doesn't it seem like a wildfire?
See that burning bridge right through the mirror?
Doesn't it make you realize
Only you can keep this flame alight?

[Verse 1]
You know I'm not ready for you
Yet you ask me for forgiveness
You said you've got something to prove
So you target when I'm weakest

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope it gets easier
I hope things get better
I'm hoping for many things
But many things don't last
No, they don't last forever

[Chorus]
Doesn't it seem like a wildfire?
See that burning bridge right through the mirror?
Doesn't it make you realize
Only you can keep this flame alight?

[Verse 2]
I carry the weight of the world
Getting worn down by the burden
Stay married to your own self
Seems like nothing never hurts ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope it gets easier
I hope things get better
I'm hoping for many things
But many things don't last
No, they don't last forever

[Chorus]
Doesn't it seem like a wildfire?
See that burning bridge right through the mirror?
Doesn't it make you realize
Only you can keep this flame alight?
Doesn't it seem like a wildfire?
See that burning bridge right through the mirror?
Doesn't it make you realize
Only you can keep this flame alight?

[Verse 3]
I'm not the type to let it go
Holding on for more of you
Not more of meaning, I suppose
Devour me slowly
Set foot underneath the flame, now up in smoke
Pay me back like it's always in my control
I jump on this racehorse
Devour me slowly

[Chorus]
Doesn't it seem like a wildfire?
See that burning bridge right through the mirror?
Doesn't it make you realize
Only you can keep this flame alight?

[Outro]
Doesn't it seem like a wildfire?

[Verse 1]
If it were up to me
I’d turn you into a stone
And turn the lights down low for effect
And I’d steal your cigarettes and I'd be
Softer than I am through cigarette smoke
And if anybody asks, I'll say I did it as a joke, so
But how about his loneliness, he gets it from his mom
100 dollars for his haircut, but a smile from God
And when he touches you you’ll wonder how he keeps his hands so soft
He got some money from his grandma
Guess he’ll never have a job

[Chorus 1]
Oh pretty boy (pretty boy)
Don’t speak (don't speak)
You pretty boys (pretty boys)
Are only good for one thing (for one thing)

[Verse 2]
But anyways
That isn’t even what I meant to say
I meant to sing a song to you to make you fall asleep
And I wouldn’t have to talk to you and you wouldn’t talk to me
But I could lay on top of you and soak in all your heat
Don’t let them catch you crying, boy, if it didn’t really hurt
She took a drink to jog her memory but it didn’t really work
She meant to sing a song but couldn’t memorize the words
She only knew the chorus she had to mumble through the verse

[Chorus 2]
Oh pretty boy (pretty boy)
Don’t think (don't think)
You pretty boys (pretty boys)
Are only good for one thing (for one thing)

[Verse 1]
She said "Come over there's nobody home"
I went over, there was nobody home
But her light was on
Her light was on
And I'm not as drunk as I seem
But still I stood out there in the street
Throwing stones at her window
Like I saw somebody do on TV

[Chorus 1]
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
Until Sunday
Until Sunday
Until

[Verse 2]
She said "Come over there's nobody home"
She said "I know that's what I told you before
But here in New York, you don't need excuses to dress like a girl"
Sex, drugs and deceit
I guess she's not as frail as she seems
I pushed as hard as I could
But she said "That's okay because that's the way that I like it"

[Chorus 2]
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
Ooh, 7 days til Sunday
Until Sunday
Until Sunday
Until

[Verse 3]
She said come over 'cause everyone's here
And I'm glad she had to make that clear
Smoking cigs on her roof
Laughing at the people on the train 'cause they're not like us
But I lost the drugs and I stayed too long
I got drunk and made fun of her band
But thank god it was Sunday and there's more than just one way
To ruin a one-night stand

[Chorus 3]
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
Ooh, 7 days til Sunday
Until Sunday
Until Sunday
Until

[Verse 1]
She asked me how to be funny
But that’s not something you can teach
What seemed so blue in the sunlight
By the night was a pale green

[Chorus 1]
And I tried to hold her
But it didn’t really last long
And she’s getting older
I guess she’s gotta cut her blue hair off

[Verse 2]
She asked me if she was pretty
Well it’s clear that the girl’s a fraud
There’s really no way of winning
If in their eyes you’ll always be a dumb blonde

[Chorus 2]
And she cried over nothing
So there was nothing I could do to stop
Her from cutting
Her beautiful blue hair off

[Verse 3]
It looked like cotton candy
And just as quick to get licked away
Last I heard she was living
With a boy who acts his age

[Chorus 3]
And I guess I’ll just miss her
Even though she isn’t even really gone
But things are just different
Ever since she cut her blue hair off

[Verse 1]
From the moment that he looked at you and walked your way
Until the second when you knew there'd be no second date
Maybe your heart felt fine, it was your head that ached
But still you kissed him in the sprinklers but it felt like rain

[Chorus 1]
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world

[Verse 2]
And from the moment when he said something and made you laugh
Until he was kind enough to let you know that it wouldn't last
But still you laid there in his arms after you'd swore you'd leave
Hair blowing from the ceiling fan but it felt like a breeze

[Chorus 2]
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world

[Verse 1]
Face it kid
She never really did
And everything you said
Fell like spit into her drink

[Chorus 1]
And while you were sleeping
She was lying there awake
Just wondering how long it would take
Till she could get back to her place
And find some other cloud
To drift on

[Verse 2]
Face it babe
Boys were made to fly away
No matter what they say
They’ll lie right to your face

[Chorus 2]
And while they were flying
You were standing on a chair
Just wondering how you could get up there
And bed an angel in mid-air
Then drag it to the ground
And drift on
And drift down
I like looking at your eyes
Playing piano and staring out your window
In the middle of the night
From your house on the hill
I was hoping
Hoping that you wouldn’t forget me
But I know you will

So don’t go around saying
There’s no such thing as love
You can’t go trading me places
Don’t forget that I
I am the cynical one

Wine and roses are fine
But I like the harder stuff
And I can still remember
When too much, too much was never enough

So don’t go around saying
There’s no such thing as love
You can’t go trading me places
Don’t forget that I
I am the cynical one
Don’t forget that I
I am the cynical one
Don’t forget that I
I am the cynical one
Don’t forget that I
I am the cynical one
As the sun sets on Sunset
It reflects against a can wet with condensation
His baby left
She’s going back to school again
And learning fifty ways to kill the conversation
'Cause if you can’t be good
You drink in the name of art
And as the sun sets on Sunset again
The stars come out so it don’t get dark
On the king of Echo Park

(The King of Echo Park)

Now she’s playing pool
At the Little Joy
Just a little drunk
She sees her little boy
And as they smoked outside
She wondered how long she’d have to wait
Until it wouldn’t be too soon
To take him back to her place
'Cause if you can’t go home (can't go home)
If you can't go home (can't go home)
With the one you love
You go home with someone
And it’s never too soon
And it’s never too late
'Cause when you’re royalty babe
You never have to work
And he’s the king of Echo Park
(The King of Echo Park)

Now he’s walking home
In the very same clothes
As the night before
Except you'd never know
And all the girls he’s bagged
They just can’t stay mad
They just wave their hands at no ordinary jerk

But who’s afraid of a little cliché
As he sipped iced tea in the palm tree shade
And as he looked around and everything was right
But as he closed his eyes he dreamt he was in New York
The King of Echo Park

(The King of Echo Park)
Baby baby when you make your escape
Make sure that you do it at the right time of day
In the middle of the night a moment of grace
As she hits every green light from here to LA

Your friends blew your cover
As sluts turn to mothers
And the legendary lovers
Get sick of one another
As dreams turn to daydreams
And punks learn to behave
Don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I’ll never change
I'll never change

[Here she comes! Here she comes! You'd better run!]

How many platitudes can you say
In the time that it takes for beauty to fade
Sedentary fireworks going bad
Like pouring out a bottle of gin on a drowning man
Shiny new fighter jets getting strafed on the deck
For every insolent B-boy who tripped and landed on his neck
Untameable stallions that got turned into glue
But don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I worry about you
Yes I do

[Here she comes! Here she comes! You'd better run!]
I dreamt that I screwed every stupid actress in LA
I dreamt that I was holding them and told them it'd be okay
It's not easy being famous anyways
So famous people say
'Cause everyone that you meet just wants to screw you
And you can't complain

And it's a shame, she'd be a queen back in Rhode Island
Now she waits in line with the other sad clichés
And besides, she's really not so sexy and wild
That was just the part she had to play

I dreamt that I saved every stupid actress in LA
And every aging waitress who gave it up
And had to change back her name
They floated out of every coke-fueled party
Every over-priced café
But that was just some dream I had
And when I woke up nothing changed

Even though she don't have grace like Greta Garbo
Even though she don't have eyes like Clara Bow
That leather glove could pluck you from the huddled mass tomorrow
And toss you through a gilded puff of smoke
I dreamt that I was every stupid actress in LA
I dreamt it that you meant it when you said that
You would come and see my play
You sat there and you watched me
And you thought it was pretty good for a pretty face
And wondered, if I had a soul to sell
Would it get bought, or just thrown away?

The statue of infamy, it gazes down in silence
From its perch up there in the Hollywood Hills
Give me your crazy and your desperate and your beautiful but inspired
I'll give them glamour, give them thrills

And to me there's nothing sad about a dream
She screamed as she swan dove from a pearly-white H
Those nobodies back home, they only dream while they're asleep
Not you and me babe we keep ours through the day

[Excerpt from "Crime Classics"]
"She was found wandering through the city clothed in night apparel. She drank and raved over her broken hopes. She was found groping in the dark through the holes of public buildings. And one day, she was no longer young."

Henrietta: "Sit with me for a while. Talk to me. Where did you go, when you went from me long ago? You always go away! And there's always the sound of you going away. And why do I come here? And remember. Remember what? Remember what?"

[Verse 1]
She was sexy she was sweet
Running barefoot in the street
Sipping wine out of a flask
Drinking vodka by the glass
Yeah she used to knock 'em back
As fast as they would line them up

Still sexy but she's sad
And the headache's coming on
Only dancing out of habit
She doesn't recognize the song
How can the nights be getting long
When time feels like it's speeding up

She used to crush the pill right between her fingers
It used to kill the feeling but now the feeling lingers
And she did the drugs for fun
But now she does them just to stay up
Just to stay up 

[x4]

[Sample]
Henrietta: "And that's all you get. Buy me a drink...Buy me a drink!...Kitty."
Kitty: "You've had enough."
Henrietta: "I know. But you're a friend of mine..."
Kitty: "No drink."
Henrietta: "Lend me two dollars."
Kitty: "I don't have it!"
Henrietta: "Then I'll lend you some! Hundreds!"
Kitty: "You ought to go home."

[Verse 2]
Incognito at the bar
She could tell he was a star
By the way he wore his baseball cap
Slung low across his eyes
While beauties live and die
These playboys stay forever young

Which handsome stylish rake
Puts his hands around her waist
As she stumbles up the stairs
In a state of perfect grace?
They would hold her just to hold her
But now it's 'cause she can't stand up
Running for the pleasure
Wearing down the flesh
And she has to go to sleep now
When she used to go to bed
Eyes closed because she felt it
But now it's 'cause she can't wake up

She can't wake up 

[x5]

[Sample]
Henrietta: "There, young man. Did you enjoy your dance?...Then buy me a drink."
Man: "Well, what's your pleasure?"
Henrietta: "Oh, Kitty! A gin!...Gin is my pleasure."
Man: "Well, drink away!"
Henrietta: "Stop it. You're making fun of me. Stop it. I'll kill you."

[Outro]
Henrietta: "No one will ever know. No one will ever know."

Man: "What?"
Henrietta: "This place we're in. The time..."

[Intro]
Yeah, aye, aye, yeah
One two, one two, aye
Uh, uh, uh ,uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse]
Fast lane, living bad thang, giving brain from the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I'm high as god
Why is it lord that I can't seem to slow the whip down?
The same by standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don't follow rules
Call those blues, nigga hol' up, y'all still don't got a clue
All the cool niggas from highshools that still ain't doin' shit
'Member when you used to fuck niggas up 'til theblue and shit
Now yo ass broke as a joke and 'em niggas doin' it
It's funny how the tables turn in life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy unless they need a dollar
From his baby momma and you still don't wear a condom
Is you stupid nigga?
Fallin' in love with these hoes
Is you cupid nigga?
You better learn before you burn, boy
See me stay all top of my game, David Stern boy
Did his dirt like worms but my mind was more concerned with the future
Y'all niggas stuck in neutral
This the city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya
I'm here to get you higher baby, so this here's the booster
I'm tryna be the king nigga, this that Martin Luther, shit is crucial
Now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ville, still pourin' liquor for my niggas, killed yeah

[Avant-Garde Effects]

[Poem]
Sitting on steps, the topmost
There's a pasture before me
Where the brief shadows of small trees are plain to see at 2 a.m
Where the moon lights the back of a head
Bowed in respect of all that is
I'm not sure I want to talk anymore
Maybe there is something I could say a poet would feel
Maybe there's no need
A true poet already sits beside me
Head bowed to the moonlight
I am at once alone and inside everything
Even in the den of the world there is a silence that sings of reverence
There is a space that cannot be described
In that space words are noise:
Substantiated evidence of distraction, a step behind now
An understandable preoccupation of the mind's attempt at solving a mystery
So I am not sure if I want to talk anymore
Some days my heart is heavier than I knew I could bear
Some days it floats beyond gravity's reach
And words are heavy
To use them lets loose an anchor that only proves the science of causality
I know these things
Though the knowing mostly serves as a reminder of an absence
Maybe only momentary, or
Until the moon shines once more on a poet's bowed head
So I am not sure I want (much) to talk
There is no sayable clarity
No translation in large print
There is only this moment
And I live inside it alone
But look upon the world with eyes that say what can't be said

[Avant-Garde Effects]

[Avant-Garde Effects]

[Verse 1]
Joni sang me a story
Misty-eyed train ride New York rain
In the morning
Time's not ticking, it's pouring
Each tock like a drop of the melting sun
Sun warming

[Chorus]
Well some tired ghost came by
Didn't even try
You were out waving goodbye
With arms open wide to the sky
Oh my love, I want to know why
Why you call to me this way

[Verse 2]
Come on, come to me, my love
Fast on the arms of the eastern light
Through the window
Now I am trying to forgive you
But nothing I ever do takes you
Brings you back

[Chorus]
Well some tired ghost came by
Didn't even try
You were out waving goodbye
With arms open wide to the sky
Oh my love, I want to know why
My love, I want to know why
My love I want to know
Why you call to me this way

[Avant-Garde Effects]

[Spoken]
I should just sell that to Nashville
Was that, was that it?
It's the second of the A
And the chord before it

[Verse 1]
Motel six, slow gin fizz
Swinging in the lobby, do the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it, move them hips
C'mon everybody, get dangerous!
Fellars, if you wanna get that invite quicker
Pack up the pick-up, pick up the liquor
Go on use your charm, so come on, go on get her
It's about time!

[Pre-Chorus]
Ladies if you really wanna reign them suckers
Line up your lips, plump up your pluckers
It's about the only way to get them motherfuckers
To do what you want to!

[Chorus]
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon

[Verse 2]
Motel six, you're so sick
Swinging from the ceiling like a front man Rick
Show a little skin for my polaroid pic
Promise I won't show your little girlfriend this!
Ladies, if you really wanna know my secret
Come a little closer, kitty, promise you'll keep it
Come a little nearer, dear, you're gonna need it
Gonna tell you

[Pre-Chorus]
Men like a woman who just don't need 'em
Sweeter than cherry pie but we'll treat 'em
Meaner than dirt, they deserve to be hurt
'Til they realize what you're worth, worth, worth

[Chorus]
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon

[Bridge]
Maybe we can go to the 7-Eleven
Drive down the main drag in your pontiac heaven
You can drink and drive, whatever you want to
And we'll get right down to it, me and you boo
We're layin' on the hood like it's a flatbed truck
In the spotlight we see Jim and Chuck
Saw that car from a mile away and it's slowin'
"They say that there's a motel dance, let's get going."

[Outro]
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
Motel 6, drive-in flix
Ladies in their black cars, bras, and kicks
Babies at the sitters and we're getting our fix
Keepin' it, keepin' it, glamorous
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon

[Verse 1]
Walking home in her dirty clothes
She is a flower that no one knows
And the man her blue eyes hold
I can see it now, in the way they glow
She gave blood to him for me

[Verse 2]
Oh, the blade of the old man's knife
How he carved his twisted life
Through her young body in the hard, white light
And her eyes, they fell as black as night
She gave blood to him for me

[Chorus]
Her little wrists
Her little hands
Black flowers land
Into her future child

[Verse 3]
I see my momma at 15
Dancing like a disco queen
I see my father, he was 43
And he held her down, saying, "Don't you scream."
She gave blood to him for me

[Chorus]
Her little wrists
Her little hands
Black flowers land
Into her future
My mother
My mother
My mother

[Verse 1]
We jumped straight into
The iris of the lake
You threw your arms around my neck, you knew
My heart was yours
My heart was yours

[Verse 2]
Stay up late into
The iris of the day
You said just one more cigarette, you knew
My heart was yours
My heart was yours

[Verse 3]
Man you change, you grew
You grew another face
You chewed my flesh and spit the taste, you knew
My heart was yours
My heart was yours

[Outro]
And everybody and I never knew before
You tell me what you needed and you need a little
You know that you a ten and it ain't you again
I know, I know, I know, oh
Oh everybody and I never knew before
You tell me what you needed and you want a little
You know you a da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I know, I know, I know
How sad it is that time should pass
Her Majesty, the hourglass
We take the sand of bygone years
And make mud of it with all our tears

What is now compared to then
And will I ever love again?
The answer to the answer brings
The endless search for everything

[Introduction]
And I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime

[Vocals: Sam Brown, Durga McBroom & Claudia Fontaine]

[Interlude]
I never said I was frightened of dying

[Vocals: Sam Brown, Durga McBroom & Claudia Fontaine]

[Verse 1]
You come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on off
Disconnected, unaffected
Better take the call

[Verse 2]
Show you pictures of my hometown
A pin could drop from miles down
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend
When I know just what we are

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing in common
Except the bed we lay on

[Chorus]
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

[Verse 3]
You're a habit I can't break
Disaster to eliminate
What part of no do I not understand?
When you're no good for me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I know we will never
Be some kind of forever

[Chorus Extended]
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on the thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Oh, it's empty in between

[Bridge]
You come over
Yeah, it's over
Oh, we know just what we are

[Chorus Extended]
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on the thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Oh, it's empty in between

[American Dragon Theme Song: "The Chosen One"]

[Verse 1]

He's cool, he's hot like a frozen sun
He's young and fast, he's the chosen one
People, we're not bragging
He's the American Dragon

[Bridge]
He's gonna stop his enemies with his dragon power
Dragon teeth, dragon tail, burning dragon fire
A real live wire

[Chorus]
American Dragon
(Dragon up)
American Dragon
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaaaa
He's the American Dragon
(break down with the dragon)

[Verse 2]

His skills are getting faster with Grandpa he master!
His destiny will walk up streets! It's showtime baby for the legacy!

[Chorus]

American Dragon

(Gong rings)

[Verse]
'Bout to murder this shit nigga look
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, my jeans ain't ever empty
And nigga I ain't Gucci but no skier ever get me
The 7 series Beamer ain't the reason they respect me
I ain't never been a pussy cause my team will never let me
The modern day Hannibal, flock Fresc' animal
I'm sick, I'm sick and I ain't got a antidote
Skeetin' in yo girls mouth nigga and her throat
I'll grill y'all peel like cantaloupe
Oh and it's so sincere, two European broads and they both in here
Me and Rimes took turns we was both in there
And my girl is like a fox but she don't wear fur
Hoes used to say "no" now they like "oh yeah sure"
They don't even call me Lanez they like "oh yes sir"
I'm a go-getter, never go get her, from her crib what I look like that ho chauffeur, gettin' hella dome
Put Lady Gaga on my telephone, hella gone ay yo girl beat no metronome
My new bitch she a yellow bone
I buy her yellow stones cause I like it when she got that yellow on
So tell me where the flag beat at
If I had one wish I'd bring Max B back
Bought to buy a lamb tell me where the back seat at
Please free Gucci, Boosie and Weezy we black
So you could say that Tory Lanez is a porn star
But you couldn't find my roof with an on-star
Never slip nigga, I be on guard
Sicker than a swine no time for you cornballs
Eight long bags, stay calm fag, I'm on more beats then the J arms tag
Colder than another shuttle tell me where the quilt at
Tory is a motherfucker tell me where the milf at
I can get you killed black, like the way I kill tracks, we gon' leave you with your scalp and it's all peeled back
Only nigga that be hangin' like a pendant, rip the beat so hard niggas had to mend it
Fuck it let's cement it, cause I killed it, I'm feeling some resentment
Fuck I just killed that shit, so I'ma come back and avenge it
Reincarnation of the track on some revenge shit
Step inside the club all the girls in a frenzy
I be writin' 'til my pen break (yeah)
'Cause I'm hungry, I'm to the point that my ribs ache
I just wanna see your hips shake
My Latin shawty call me papi while she fix me up a big steak
See I'm hungry for a big plate (Yeah)
And I'm never full even though I just ate
Call me the foreign model fucker, get they twist on like a soda bottle cover
Tired of breaking it to niggas that I got they lover, hold her and I fold her like some sort of origami sculpture
Read between the lines, see between her eyes
Killing that pussy R.I.P. between yo thighs
I seem to be despised by some very evil guys
Fake niggas do fake shit so don't believe the lies

[Verse 1]
Through my window I can see
If the world is there for me
Will my shadow on the floor let me be?

[Hook]
And tomorrow calls my name
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

[Chorus]
C'est la vie
C'est la vie

[Verse 2]
With my friends I play the tune
Warm and tired within my room
And the crackle of the fire whispered low

[Hook]
Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

[Chorus]
C'est la vie
C'est la vie

[Outro]
How can I sail my good times
Over the waves of sorrow?
Show me tomorrow
Show me tomorrow
So that I will know

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la

[Hook]
Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

[Chorus]
C'est la vie
C'est la vie

[Outro]
Through the burning flames of time
C'est la vie
C'est la vie

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
We had, something special baby
We don't, need to tell nobody else
That's just, that's just because you can't 

[??]

And in my draws, in my drink in the morning
I swear my phone going off on your number
What did you do to me?
I feel so honest
Oh I feel on it

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Lets have sex on the beach yeah sex on the ye-yeah
It's so dirty yes some more flirty yeah
She wanna make love in the boat and chat in the spot oh yeah
You wanna make love to the right one and I might be
It might be me, it might be me, it might be me
Said it might be me, it might be me, it might be me
It might be me, it might be, it might be me
It might be -

[Verse 1]
Me and my mother, driving to the grocery store
Me riding shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustling harder, rollers and a nightgown

[Verse 2]
Me and my father, driving to the football game
Me riding shotgun, my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughing
I was much happier when he was around

[Bridge]
When he was around
When he was around
Around

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Around
Around
Around
Me and my mother

All chicks said they love a young black lad
Rubbin' on my ugh like it came with a track pad
Be in the lot, be in the lot doing donuts

Mama wanna hop up in the drop, so what
Oh she with her friend, let 'em in ring 'em both up
Uh, blow me like a stick of nicotine

Peep the wrist it's really cold, Jackson

[Intro]
You! Yes you! Stand still laddie!

[Intro solo]

[Verse]
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(Oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
(Ahahahahahahaha!!!!)
But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives
Ooooooh, oooooh, ooooh, ooooooh
Ooooooh, oooooh, oooooooh

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
If I never told you this let me say this to you properly
Momma you my everything, you taught me how to be this way
Devil is a liar so I'ma walk the Jesus way
You taught me how to lead so I'ma take the stand and lead today
I thank you for everything you've given me
More precious than jewelry and you could read it in my eulogy
Every day you pray for me and keep them demons away from me
I love you dearly, sincerely 

[?]
Love Snoop

[Chorus]
Momma, thank you for having me
Could've gave me up instead you raised a family
I wanna thank you momma, thank you for having me
Could've gave me up but you did it like a G
Momma, thank you for having me
Could've gave me up but you raised a family
I wanna thank you momma, thank you for having me (Mother)
Could've gave me up (Mother) but you did it like a G (Momma)

[Verse 2]
What can I say? What can I do?
I'll sit back and admire you
Oh what a beauty you are to me
(Woah momma)
This song to you I dedicate
The sacrifices that you made
And today's your special day, oh
Surrounded by your family and your friends
We want you to know you're a special lady
You are appreciated, oh (Momma)
You were always there for me (Momma)

Ok and startin' off the record I be fresher than you ever are

I walk in the room and got your woman on in extra awe
She ain't never felt this way before
I only go to eat out got a beach house by the shore
And we out with our feet out bumpin' me now that's for sure
And we out VIP now King of Diamonds got these whores
I'm a 

[?] and you haters knee high
How your money long if it ain't longer than my Levi's
Shawty let my man in baby we can call you Eli
If you niggas claiming that you hot I'm Costa Rica
Sayin' that I'm young and just amazing
And no I ain't the greatest
To say that I'm that greatest is a fucking understatement
I guess I'm fucking underrated but I'm never under payment
But some heffers love to claim that this the freshest they done seen me nigga
Yeah, aight nigga yeah
Hate a nigga shinin' with these diamonds in my ear (Bling)
Her ass way thicker than the tires in the rear (I know)
My flight arrive at 9 and I feel flyer than a Lear
I got my nigga 

[?], my nigga 

[?]
She asked me what I wanted
I say "give me the works"
She call my nigga Jay, she love that nigga Rimes
And we just love to see her 'cause we hit it every time
You mad because your baddest chick is probably just a 9
My money is so 3-6-0 it's never in a line
I get so much green I feel like I live in a vine
I eat the instrumental up like it was dinner time
You ain't talking to a nigga like me though
Grind like Nino
Women know a nigga hard to find like Nemo
Ask me why I do it, I do it for the T.O
Coming through and get your Jackson no Tito
Ladies put your flyest stuff it on me
All my niggas hit the floor poppin' bottles of Patrón
You know it's a celebration 'cause they keep the Henny on you know we gon' get it on
And we gon' throw some cash up in the air
We just celebrate the fact we here
'Cause it could've been worse, so cop that Mr. Peterson on January 1st

[Outro]

And I'ma do it to 'em like that every time baby
Yeah
Canada
You know me

[Intro]
Um, you know when I get my Aston Martin
I'll be in there, seats on recline, bad bitch in the passenger
Spliff burning with Matesa on, you feel me?
Lay back, just cruise

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele & Tory Lanez]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
(1 Verse Killah)
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all (Uh, Canada)
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tory Lanez]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go (yeah)
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing

[Verse]
Uh, everybody saying remember me
But where the hell is y'all memories?
I'm searching through walls of my membrane
It's insane, I'm entertainin' the big names
Through diamond, silver lining on my big frames
Niggas stressin' all I'm seeing through the Oakleys
Shit depressin', so we investing to blow trees
Had a dream I was chillin' in the OC
Then I landed out in Cali where they woke me
Discrete mumbles, from summer to street jungle
Voice from my uncle he tell me to keep humble
But at times I slip into deep wonder
Would they show they support in the event that my feet stumble?
See, when you already on, it's harder to say shit
Like the feelin' when you dazed and caught in amazement
Girls gotta stay separate from all of your statements
'Cause for the most part, hoes want a part of the payment
I'm relaxing in the Rolls Royce
Getting money 'cause I give these hoes no choice
I'm all alone in my box, blunt burnin' in the zone with my thots, wait

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Sometimes a nigga change for the money
Ladies that love me and all of these whips I roll
But buying all the dollars, so why would I holla?
Tryna put my pockets on swole
And I ain't got no time, no-no time (I ain't got no time)
I just got memories, oh no-no, yeah
(And I just got the memories, yeah)

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tory Lanez]
(uh, Mr. Peterson, January 1st, 0-11)
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the...

She told me let's be honest oh really then let's be honest
And then her friend walked in, damn that's ironic
The bottoms of exotic its gotta make it erotic
Mama shake it for papi, I'm probably making your body

I ain't gotta buy it I'm surviving off of coupons
Who the best?
So who the fuck is it
And if it ain't me
Then who fuck is it?
A section with some bottles, and not too much in it
Nowadays it's all it takes for us to fuck bitches
So let's get a drink on
My heart is filled, mink on
Money filled something like I just took Brink's home
What's longer my money or my link on
I'm navigating women I don't even drive a Lincoln
I shine so bright you woulda swore I had pink on
Neck so froze like I got the roller rink on
As far as your mouth goes you need to put a pint on
'Cause all I hear is run, run, running like the sink on
Damn

[Hook: Justin Vernon, Teyana Taylor & Tory Lanez]
Can we get much higher? Yes we can So high

Do more than freakin' but more to speak when they exploring why my aura beacon
For this season is more glorious than all the deacons
Still notorious nigga she call me Morpheus
And we ain't have to grind our choice 'cause they was forcing us
Still the voice of the poorest of all the poorest
It's getting green like a forest and enemies can't ignore it
And my engine gets so loud a nigga just gotta floor it
I got more than a Ford Explorer to explore it
And I'm out with a Lauren, it's South for Ralph Lauren
And the game nearly died I put mouth to mouth on it
Meet my meat come put your scalp on it
I don't vouch on it I could throw a house on it
Make a nigga money get low letharge on it
It's me and three bitches bitch you might as well join it, yeah

Welcome to my dungeon
This is where I'm placing your frame in case you was wonderin'
Niggas getting comfortable too comfortable thinking I won't come up on some other shit, nigga you on some other shit
Heavenly grace so I never forsake the covenant
Though I'm hotter than the covers that you covered with
Still the youngest muh'flocka in the building
And if it ain't the flight then it's probably not appealing
My top ceiling got that ceiling to fill in we in the middle with the dealing just grillin'
So talk and to pop pill in your ceiling it's something close like it's really your feeling
What's going on with the game don't nobody keep it real now
Crooked straight playing up on the deal now
Look how niggas done got you in the field now
Now they slaving your ass you gotta kill now
Huh, lucky I got up on some smarter shit
I always kept it 300 on some Sparta shit
I never let a nigga sway me on no offer shit
I'm really coming for the game I want all of it
More money more problems

[Verse 1]
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy ‘cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

[Chorus]

It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right

Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night

[Post-Chorus]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see ya it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels
(head over heels)
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

[Intro: Tyga]
D.A.
Hah

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?
And the city love my name, nigga, I ain't gotta say it

[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same like Mary-Kate

(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Taste, taste), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
Make these bitches scream
Ah, pretty little thing
Like my nigga A.E.
Say, "Yadadadamean"

[Chorus: Tyga & Offset]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same like Mary-Kate

(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Yes, yes), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool (Offset)

[Verse 3: Offset]

Ayy, ayy, feed me grapes, Maybach with the drake (Grapes)
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae (Skrrt)
Diamonds up to par (Par), the cookie hittin' hard (Hard)
The 'Rari sit in park (Park), on Addy on Mars (Mars)
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target (Blah)
Popcorn, big shell poppin' out the cartridge (Pop it)

Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley (Ride)
She wanna keep me company and never wan' depart me, depart me (No)
Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot (Skrrt, skrrt)
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya (Yeah)
Yeah, and I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya (Fire)
Yeah, keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet (Who?)
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly (Woah)
Stack it up and put it with the whole project (Racks)
And she got that Patek on water moccasin (Patek)
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy (Hey)

[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste

Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go 'n back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up

Juicy thing, make that pussy sing
One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come boohoo this shit

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy a sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy, that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Intro]
DOOM, Super Metal Finger Villain, just chilling
(Super) Boutta' get this million, (Chilling) chilling
Yo, this chick tried to tell him:
Ooh, you're like the sun (She said)
Chasing all of the rain away (She said, she said, she said)
When you come around, you bring brighter days
(She told him)
You're the perfect one
For– (For yo, yo, yo, I told her)
And I will rock this mic (Rock this mic)
For always, it go like

[Verse 1]
I hold mics like niggas hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done split it
To be specific, more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the God in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was tore back, the ho gained access to my beeper
Called back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said "Darling you was stupid though"
You know the Supervillain (He is a super...)

[Verse 2]
I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
Emcees who styles need Velamints
And once the smoke clear, tell 'em it's
The Super Metal Face Villain
He came through raw like the elements
On 99 plus one of them
Plus with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
When we with y'all, we had tons of fun
Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U
Throwing divine rules to come through
We will over charge you
And won't feel remorse for shit
Except for once
Once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits (damn)
Scientific going berserk like Red Alert
I really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
To fund these experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From niggas with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke all fakes
Who thought they were slaughter proof
Stomping through like North Face waterproof

[Outro]
(Tat-tat) That's the end of that
After hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
I told her more wine, mingling with no single mentions of
Stay tuned for more spine-tingling adventures of...
(Super-motherfucking-Villain)
Super-motherfucking-Villain, love

[English]
If you don’t want to marry me, just tell me the truth
Don't you wanna play with me, don't you wanna talk to me? Please tell me the truth

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Yeah
Well
Attention to my youngins coming up in this shit
Let me tell you what you do, teachers say you ain’t shit
Hack off in her IG, get up in her email
Find something in it that’ll humble that bitch
Get a 8 ball better not fumble that bitch
Better double that shit
Make a hundred right back
It outta be illegal making money like this
If it is that what everyone says you can’t tell
Yeah
Imma have a thing for the arm and hammer
Before these niggas was even thinkin’ about Atlanta
Little Bankhead nigga off Balton Road
With a snubbed nose short like Muggsy Bogues
Don’t try one can't take 6 of us
Plus you might get shot no fisticuffs (okay)
King in real life
Shinnin’ til my
Lights cut off and life is fucked off
Til them and Rick kept me in Miami ducked off
Somewhere on Biscayne
Ride in the Lambo
Abracadabra magic like we in Orlando
And where your bitch go
And where her pants go
Turn that around automatically mando
If her feet fucked up hanging out her sandals
On that mob shit like Marlon Brando
Smoking weed trappin’ standing under the lamp post
For real all a nigga ever done
Was come up on a bag turn around and get another one
Then how I came up on a bunch of money
And a bunch of motherfuckers tryna find a way to get it from me
Avoid the red tape proceed to rampage
Now a days these niggas be so goddamn fake
And I can’t stand things that are pretending
To hear you speak is so condensing
I say fuck that watch with your diamonds in it
Tryna turn myself into a monument
Stimulate the economy
Buy a Rolls Royce and hold your horse
Niggas talk loud but got no voice
Better fall in line and leave no choice
And I ain’t finna play about that
And that’s really all a nigga really care to say about that

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Bust
Dedicated to all the bustas
We just bustin’
TIP
RAP
ATL to Raleigh North Carolina
But I was born and raised in Snowy Hill 252 Green County all day yeah
Where I’m from some niggas do die
Some women do bust everybody got 5
I ain’t never done street shit, just too fly
Get down, lay down, boy we’re too high
Hood divided I seen it live, seen the drugs, seen the love
All of it here for pride
Use to date a drug dealer in my past life
Drink Boons Farm smoke just to pass nights
Potential bigger than a monument
Real nigga, look up to me honestly
And my old whip, that old shit, the 95
I use to 9 to 5 with back in 99
I had a real job fool I could legally drive
Return pushin’ a kickass ride
Bustin’ rhymes, I bust around, bustin’ 9s
Y’all doin’ that y’all is wild
Tell ya child they ain’t gotta walk or run the mile
We ran the course so y’all can stop
Tip ‘em back the tip of that I tip ‘em over
He dead yeah yeah I know it
Mother fuckas should know I’m Noah
Ha ha big boat bitch uh
Look I could walk on water ah
I care to say I care bout y’all
Care bout love, care bout God
Carry the cross don’t get carried away
Over character flaws mother fuckas they don’t care bout us
Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson I punch ‘em out
Mother fucka what happened here
TIP, RAP kill it
Mother fucka back how the fuck you feelin’ ah

[Verse 1]
‪June's glowing red
Oh, strawberry moon
You're always coming back a little older
But it looks alright on you

[Verse 2]
Let's find an out
We'll start anew
With the headlights in your eyes
I see it all over you

[Verse 3]
Burn out when you want
Something that's lost belongs to you
If someone should pay for it
Well, I don't know who
Who

[Part 1 (Instrumental)]

[Part 2 (Instrumental)]

[Part 3 (Instrumental)]

[Part 4]
Remember when you were young?
You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond!

You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

[Part 5 (Instrumental)]

[Part 7]
Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers
And I’ll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we’ll bask in the shadow of yesterday’s triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright (both)]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright (both)]
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
Its good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Spoken by Gary Yudman]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Earls Court. My name is Gary Yudman and we are going to have a great show this evening. The band is backstage and will be ready to go in just a few minutes. Before the show begins, the house management would just like to request a few things

First, please no fireworks. Also, please no flash cameras. And any unauthorized audio or video equipment that is being used may be confiscated, so, please, save yourself a lot of hassle

[Spoken very slowly]
Good evening, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and
Welcome to Earl's Court;
My name is Gary Yudman, and we are going to have a great
Show this evening!
The band is backstage, and will be ready to go in just a few
Minutes...
Before the show begins, the house management would like to
Ask just a few things:
First, please, no fireworks; and please, no flash cameras;
And, any audio or

Video equipment found being used may be confiscated; so

A lot of hassle

(Drowned out by music)

[Verse: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse: Kid Chorus]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave those kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Faded outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still laddie!
Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round?

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I’m hiding?

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Will the misty master break me?
Will the key unlock my mind?
Will the following footsteps catch me?
Am I really dying?
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Pt.1

[Intro - Ray BLK]
Wake up!

[Verse 1 - will.i.am, (Ray BLK)]
I wanna say what's on my motherfuckin' conscious
The whole world right now is fucking bonkers
The internet is the brand new conqueror
So watch out for the motherfuckin' monsters, yikes
The trolls are the taunters
Whoever controls the data got the answers
They the ones that got the code to the launcher
And they be having dinner with the Pope and the mobsters
They know the cure for the cancer
Cure for the AIDS and they prolly killed the Panthers
Put us in a cage, got us living like hamsters
Put us in the dark but I got me a lantern
Open up my third eye, then I illuminate
Willy got a bird eye view when I elevate
No Illuminati, baby, I'm god body
The rapture like Blondie, wakin' up zombies
(Wake up!)

[Chorus - Jessica Reynoso, (Ray BLK)]
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

[Refrain - Jessica Reynoso, (Ray BLK)]
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
(Wake up!)

[Verse 2 - Taboo, will.i.am & both, (Ray BLK)]
A wise man said knowledge is king
Know thyself and you can do anything
Know thyself and you can shine like bling
Know thyself and you the king of the ring, ha
But they don't teach kids nothing
All they know is iPad, sugar in their muffin
They don't know division, don't add to nothing
Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing
He in the streets cause he always cuttin'
The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'
All they do was stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em with stuff he can't use
So he sell crack, that's what he know to do
His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too
And that's why you see the lil' killer in the news
It's kinda like they got us in a trap
It's kinda like they knowin' how we act
I'll be like "fuck your fuckin' laboratory, I am not a rat"
I am light, I am God body, wise to the fact
(Wake up!)

[Chorus - Jessica Reynoso, (Ray BLK)]
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

[Refrain - Jessica Reynoso, (Ray BLK)]
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
(Wake up!)

[Bridge - Jessica Reynoso]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Pt.2

[Intro - Ray BLK]
Shh
Wake up!
Wake up!

[Verse 3 - apl.de.ap, (with Ray BLK)]
Eyes open, who's watching the watchers?
Clock ticking like we're running out of options
Villains in the White House, heroes in their coffins
Leaders double cross while we kneeling to our crosses
Whose policing the police, why they stalking?
All lives matter 'til your color is the target
Fox rounding up the sheep for the slaughter
Money over people while they reaching for that dollar
All I see's lies on the screen
Land of the free, but what the fuck's free?
What does it cost to let a nigga breathe?
King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh
They robbed you blind and knowledge is a crime
This shit's designed to keep you on a grind
Rise and shine 'cause now it's the time
We all God body if you open up your mind
(Wake up!)

[Chorus - Jessica Reynoso, (Ray BLK)]
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
(Wake up!)
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

[Bridge - Jessica Reynoso]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Pt.3

[Verse 4 - will.i.am]
Ain't nothing impossible, I tell myself
That I am possible, I know that devil
Is out there and plotting those plans
To stop me and put me in a hospital bed
I said "Yo, I will not be toppled
I'm down with Jesus and I roll with apostles"
We got that big love, that love that's colossal
We meditate, ain't no need to get hostile
You cannot penetrate me with the hate
We got that good vibration on vibrate
Stay on that way up 'cause we elevate
We got that big love, that love heavyweight

[Bridge - will.i.am]
Wait, wait, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Ha, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel

[Verse 5 - will.i.am]
I tell them, yo
The movement's unstoppable
Pausing the flow, that is not optional
I let 'em know, everything's solvable
When you know science, everything is plausible
I am defiant, I'm also logical
Politicians be tripping, they comical
So I sit back and listen to audio
Spiritual hip-hop, I call that hypnoticals
We Budda-Boy, B-Boy phenomenals
We Zulu-kill zombies in chronicles
We ain't falling 'cause we ain't dominoes
That revolution is on go, go

[Outro - will.i.am]
Go, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Yup, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Uh

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And I know you know I fuck you better than he can

[Verse One: David Gilmour]
Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say that I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me and hide with me, baby
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and...

[Pre-Chorus One: Roger Waters]
Jumped into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, "this is my last goodbye"

[Chorus: David Gilmour (and Richard Wright)]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Verse Two: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in...

[Pre-Chorus Two: Roger Waters]
People pressing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

[Chorus: David Gilmour (and Richard Wright)]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it

[Outro: Roger Waters]
And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye
Nobody cry, it's goodbye

(Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye) (x8)

[Verse 1]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and summery

[Chorus 1]
And no one call us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Darkness every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inciting and inviting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

[Introduction]
This is Radio 1
On medium wave
And this is John Peel with another concert, and this one-
No!
You blew it, you did it all wrong. Anyway, The Pink Floyd!

[Verse 1]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
Last sunlight disappears
Distant bells, new-mown grass smells
So sweet
By the river, holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

[Chorus]
And if you hear, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
A silver sound for a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Verse 2]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children's laughter in my ears
Last sunlight disappears

[Chorus]
And if you hear, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
A silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The last sunlight disappears

[Chorus]
And if you hear, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
A silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me
Sing to me, sing to me

[Commentary and "One of These Days" Introduction]
And if you had listened to this program a year ago, you would have heard the Floyd do Dave Gilmour's "Fat Old Sun" then, but it's changed quite a bit, I think, during the past twelve months

This next one is described by Roger Waters as "a poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation." Make what you will of that. During the course of it, too, Nick Mason's vocal debut comes round. And although you'll hear his voice, at no time—if you're here in the studio, of course—at no time will you see his lips move, which is something of a technical tour de force. And it's called "One of These Days, I'm Going to Cut You into Little Pieces," or for the benefit of the LP, "One of These Days."

[Verse 1]
All this love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

[Chorus 1]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

[Verse 2]
All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

[Chorus 2]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
When the fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ears
Distant bells, new mown grass smells
Song sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

[Chorus]
And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Verse 3]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children’s laughter in my ears
The last song-light disappears

[Chorus]
And if you see, don’t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

[Outro]
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling

[Verse 1]
If I were a swan, I’d be gone
If I were a train, I’d be late
And if I were a good man
I’d talk with you
More often than I do

[Verse 2]
If I were to sleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane, please don’t put
Your wires in my brain

[Verse 3]
If I were the moon, I’d be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man, I’d understand
The spaces between friends

[Verse 4]
If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I’d be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game?

[Verse 5]
If I were a swan, I’d be gone
If I were a train, I’d be late again
If I were a good man
I’d talk with you
More often than I do

[Verse 1]
Icy wind of night be gone, this is not your domain
In the sky a bird is heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

[Chorus]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
A river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 2]
In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room

[Chorus]
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
A river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

[Verse 1]
The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end?
Will the final couplet rhyme?

[Chorus]
And it’s high time!
Cymbaline
It’s high time!
Cymbaline
Please wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in
And there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent
Are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs
To magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time!
Cymbaline
It’s high time!
Cymbaline
Please wake me

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you
That they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Chorus]
And it’s high time!
Cymbaline
It’s high time!
Cymbaline
Please wake me
And it’s high time!
Cymbaline
It’s high time!
Cymbaline
Please wake me

[Verse 1]
Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger’s faces show their sympathy
They’ve seen that hope before

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 2]
Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can’t conquer all you fears

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 3]
Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 1]
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

[Verse 2]
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry ev’ry time
(du, du, du, du, du, du, du, du, du)
(du, du, du, du, du, du, du, du, du)

[Verse 3]
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away – way
People heard him say – say
I will find a way – way
There will come a day – day
Something will be done

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race
At Mildenhall

[Verse 2: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Now, now, now is the time – time
Time to be – be – be aware

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

[Verse 3: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh, my, something in my eye – eye
Something in the sky – sky
Waiting there for me

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour]
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

[Verse 4: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh – oh – did you ever know – know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

[Chorus 4: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

[Verse 1]
All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

[Chorus 1]
Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

[Verse 2]
All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

[Chorus 2]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show

[Album interlude]
Yeah, back in the sauce
So, I'd like you to be nice 'cause I'm nice, the Pink Floyd are nice, and give these boys a real big hand of applaud and a great welcome to Sweden. So everybody put your hands together

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
All you need is love
P-I-N-K-F-L-O-Y-D, Floyd go now!

[Interlude]
And I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime

[Vocals: Clare Torry]

I never said I was frightened of dying

[Vocals: Clare Torry]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear and the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map moved from side to side

[Verse 2: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen son", said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

[Verse 3: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

[Chorus 1]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Verse 2]
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me

[Chorus 2]
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Outro]
I can't think of anything to say except
Hahahahahahaha!
I think it's marvellous!
Hahaha..

[Verse: Roger Waters]
All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy
Beg, borrow, or steal
And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say
And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight
And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

[Outro]
(There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Richard Wright and David Gilmour]
Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Richard Wright and David Gilmour]
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds
The icy waters underground

[Verse 1]
As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears?
What do you want?
(What do you want from me?)
Should I sing until I can’t sing anymore?
Play these strings until my fingers are raw
I'll do my best to please

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?

[Verse 2]
Do you think that I know something you don’t know? (What do you want from me?)
If I don’t promise you the answers would you go? (What do you want from me?)
Should I stand out in the rain?
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you?
I’m not the one you need

[Chorus]
What do you want from me?

[Verse 3]
You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want
You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control
Is that really what you need?
You can lose yourself this night
See inside, there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light

[Outro]
What do you want from me?

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race toward an early grave

[Intro: Stephen Hawking]
For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Backing Vocalists]
There’s a silence surrounding me
I can’t seem to think straight
I’ll sit in the corner
And no one can bother me
I think I should speak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)
I can’t seem to speak now (You never talk to me?)
My words won’t come out right (What are you thinking?)
I feel like I’m drowning (What are you feeling?)
I’m feeling weak now (Why won’t you talk to me?)
But I can’t show my weakness (You never talk to me?)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

[Refrain: Stephen Hawking]
It doesn’t have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Backing Vocalists]
(Why won’t you talk to me?) I feel like I’m drowning
(You never talk to me?) You know I can’t breathe now
(What are you thinking?) We’re going nowhere
(What are you feeling?) We’re going nowhere
(Why won’t you talk to me?)
(You never talk to me?)
(What are you thinking?)
(Where do we go from here?)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Where were you when I was burned and broken?
While the days slipped by from my window watching
And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless?
‘Cause the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else’s words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun

[Verse 2]
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

[Outro]
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight… into the shining sun

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Jon Carin]
Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Bridge: David Gilmour & Backing Vocalists]
But it was only a fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Verse 3: Jon Carin]
Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Verse 1]
On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

[Chorus 1]
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

[Verse 2]
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And there’s a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

[Chorus 2]
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away
Slipped away

[Guitar Outro]

[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

[Intro: Backing Vocalists]
Ohhh, ohhhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Guy Pratt]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Guy Pratt]
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse 2: Kids]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Guy Pratt]
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Instrumental Outro]

[Recording]
I've been mad for fucking years
Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands
I've always been mad, I know I've been mad
Like the most of us have
Very hard to explain why you're mad
Even if you're not mad

[Coin Intro]

[Verse 1]
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Interlude: Solos]

[Verse 3]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away

[Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right
That geezer was cruising for a bruising!
- Yeah!
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out

[Verse 1]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

[Chorus 1]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Verse 2]
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me

[Chorus 2]
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Outro]
I can't think of anything to say except
Hahahahahahaha!
I think it's marvellous!
Hahaha..

[Verse: David Gilmour & Backing Vocalists]
All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy
Beg, borrow, or steal
And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say
And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight
And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

[Outro]
(There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark)

[Intro]
— and disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it?
I am sure of it

[Verse 1]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Hello? (Hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on (Come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Bridge: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: David Gilmour, Richard Wright & Backing Vocalists]
Okay
Just a little pin prick *Ding*
There'll be no more "AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

[Synth, Guitar and Drum Intro]

[Chorus]
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run

[Verse 1: Guy Pratt & David Gilmour]
You better make your face up in your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockle shell shatters
And the hammers batter down the door
You better run

[Chorus]
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run

[Verse 2: Guy Pratt & David Gilmour]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run good

[Verse 1]
On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
"Don’t accepting that what’s happening
It's just a case of others’ suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away"

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerised as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

[Verse 4]
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Chorus]
A soul in tension that’s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 3]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Chorus]
There’s no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can’t keep my mind from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Instrumental until 2:00]

[Verse 1]
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran: a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She’ll soon submit, she’s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He’s just the same as all the rest
He’s not the worst, and he’s not the best

[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

[Sampled outro]

[Instrumental until 2:43]

[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

[Instrumental until 1:03]

[Verse 1]
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world
One world… One world

[Verse 2]
Invisible transfers, long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and they're gonna smash it down
One world… One world
One world… One world

[Verse 3]
The dogs of war don’t negotiate
The dogs of war won’t capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain

[Hook]
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we gonna smash it down
One world… One world

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Verse 2]
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

[Verse 3]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
Its good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here

[Verse 1: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear and the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map moved from side to side

[Verse 2: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen son", said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

[Verse 3: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Solos]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away
Away away away
Away away away

[Verse 1: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
Hello? (Hello) (Hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on (Come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour and Rachel Brennock/Sam Brown]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
Okay
Just a little pin prick *Ding*
There'll be no more "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour and Rachel Brennock/Sam Brown]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye

I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

[Chorus]
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run

[Verse 1]
You better make your face up in your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockle shell shatters
And the hammers batter down the door
You better run

[Chorus]
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run
Run. Run. Run. Run

[Verse 2]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run good
So you thought you might like to go to the show?
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
Is there something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you want to get a look at what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you Babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooooh Babe
Ooooh Baby Blue
Ooooh Babe

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy what you leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was just another brick in the wall

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, ah
Mother, should I build the wall?
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh, ah, is it just a waste of time?

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm
Oooh babe, Oooh babe, Oooh babe
Of course Mamma's gonna help build the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: Waters]
Mother, do you think she's good enough, for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous, to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh ah
Mother, will she break my heart?

[Chorus 2: Gilmour]
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's going to check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Oooh babe, Oooh babe, Oooh baby
You'll always be baby to me

[Outro: Waters]
Mother, did it need to be so high?

[Harry Waters]
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky

[Intro]
Oooooooo
Oooooooo
Oooooooo

[Verse 1]
Di-di-di-did you see the frightened ones?
Di-di-di-did you hear the falling bombs?
Di-di-di-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave, new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

[Bridge]
Oooooooo
Oooooooo

[Verse 2]
Di-di-di-did you see the frightened ones?
Di-di-di-did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on

[Outro]
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye. Goodbye

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How should I fill the final places?
How should I complete the wall?

[Verse 1]
What shall we use
To fill the empty
Spaces
Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across this sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?

[Breakdown]

[Verse 2]
Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the East?
Contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure
Store up leisure
But never relax at all?
With our backs to the wall

[Verse 1]
I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 2]
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh, baby set me free

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooooh, I need a dirty girl

[Outro]

[Intro]
"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?"
("I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you")
"God! This place is bigger than our apartment!"
("Let me know when you're entering a room")
("Yes sir")
"Um, can I get a drink of water?"
("I was wondering about")
"You want some, huh?"
("Yes")
"Oh wow! Hey, look at this tub! Wanna take a bath?"
("I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main")
"What are you watching?"
("If you'll just let me know as soon as you can, Mrs Bancroft") ("Mrs Bancroft")
"Hello?"
("I don't understand")
"Are you feeling okay?"

[Verse 1]
Day after day, the love turns gray
Like the skin of a dying man
And night after night we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older
And you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

[Verse 2]
Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would ya?
Would you like to see me try?

[Outro]
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

[Hook]
Ooooh babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 1]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends

[Hook]
Ooooh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 2]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

[Hook]
Ooooh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 3]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooooh babe
Why are you running away?

[Outro]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Aaaaaaaaaaargh!!
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No!
Don't think I'll need anything at all

All in all it was just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Goodbye

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: Gilmour]
Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Bass Break]

[Verse 3/Outro: Waters]
Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

[Intro]
"But there's somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington.."
"Who's that?"
"Rose Pilchitt!"
"Rose Pilchitt? Who's that?"
(*Kid screams in background*)
(Shut up!)
"36-24-36 (*Laughter*) does that answer your question?"
(Oi! I've got a little black book with me poems in!)
"Who's she?"
"She was 'Miss Armoured Division' in 1961... "

[Verse 1]
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

[Chorus 1]
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

[Verse 2]
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (fly to... fly to... fly to...)

[Chorus 2]
Ooooh babe when I pick up the phone
("Surprise, surprise surprise...")
There's still nobody home

[Outro]
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day?
Vera! Vera!
What has become of you?
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do?

[Verse]
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

[Outro]
"Wrong, do it again!"
*knock* "Time to go!"
"Are you feeling okay?"
"He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!"
"Hahahahaha!!!!!!"
Is there anybody out there

[Intro]
(Ooooh, Ma, Oooh Pa)
Must the show go on?
(Ooooh, Pa. Take me home)
(Ooooh, Ma. Let me go)

[Verse: David Gilmour]
There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul
Am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa)
Where has the feeling gone?
(Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa)
Will I remember the song?
The show must go on

[Verse 1]
So ya thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel that warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

[Verse 2]
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint!
And another with spots!
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot!

[Intro]
"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
We're waiting to succeed and going to convene outside Brixton Town Hall where we're going to be...

[Verse 2: Waters]
(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood
(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queens and the coons and the reds and the Jews
(Waiting) To follow the worms

[Verse 3: Gilmour and Waters]
Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

[Outro]

[Verse]
Stop!
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform and leave the show
But I'm waiting in this cell, because I have to know
Have I been guilty all this time?

[Verse 1: Prosecutor]
Good morning, Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!

[Verse 2: The Schoolmaster]
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honour
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

[Hook 1: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy
Toys in the attic, I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)

[Verse 3: Wife]
You little shit you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
"Just five minutes, Worm your honour
Him and me, alone"

[Verse 4: Mother]
Babe
Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'lord I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honour, let me take him home

[Hook 2: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy
Over the rainbow, I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
(Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)

[Verse 5: The Judge]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

[Outro: Crowd]
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!

[Verse]
All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

[Outro]
Isn't this where...
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'mma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
(Body like a back road)
(Drivin' with my eyes closed) Got braids in her hair
(I know every curve like the back of my hand)

[Intro: Jaden Walker]
This is not real, this is a memory
A real memory

[Chorus]
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine on me
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man

[Verse 1]
I went to a dance with my high school girlfriend
Left from a dance without my high school girlfriend
Give me the chance and I can read you the stories
Burning the books 'cause life fucking bores me
So she's out there slow dancing to the song
And we're in the boys bathroom, making out, yeah

[Chorus]
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine on me
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man

[Verse 2]
Boy in jeans with the bleach blonde imagery
Boy in jeans, 1995 fantasy
Do your thing, fuck it up, feel the melody
Dance with me, dance with me

[Bridge]
Pony boy ride on, ride on, ride on me
In my dreams, in my fucking dreams
Pony boy ride on, ride on, ride on me
In my dreams, in my fucking dreams
Now she's crying on my shoulder
'Cause I left her alone
I'm selfish, 'cause all I can think about is you

[Chorus]
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine on me
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man
In my dreams, in my fucking dreams
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man
In my dreams, in my fucking dreams

[Outro]
I already miss him
I already miss him, yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze

Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on you crazy diamond

[Chorus 3: Roger Waters]
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

[Part 8 (16:22-18:30): Instrumental]

[Part 9 (18:30-19:55): Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Raving and drooling, I fell on his neck with a scream
He had a whole lot of terminal shock in his eye

[Verse 2]
That's what you get for pretending the rest are not real
Babbling and snapping at far away flies
He will zig zag his way back through memories of boredom and pain

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
How does it feel to be empty and angry and spaced
Split up the middle between the illusion of safety in numbers
And the fist in your face

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour and Roger Waters]
Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try, they're gonna love you
Well, I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think
Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train

[Verse 2: David Gilmour and Roger Waters]
We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out
You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start, it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train

[Guitar Solo]

[Spoken Intro: Nick Mason]
Could I have eggs, sausage, chips & beans and a tea?

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

[Violin Solo]

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls, swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here

[Violin Outro]
Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Marlon Brando-do-do-do
Marlon Brando-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Champion for love, champion for love
For you, I stand as tall as a mountain top
With my heart on my sleeve and my head in a dream
I murder for your heart, a stranger in the dark
For you, I fall just like an avalanche
With my heart on my sleeve and my head in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
I would run a hundred miles, a hundred miles
With my love in the ocean and my head in the clouds
I would swim a thousand laps, a thousand laps
With my love in the ocean and my head in the clouds, yeah

[Chorus]
I will be your samurai, Marlon Brando
I will slay the vampire for you (Aye-aye, aye, aye)
I will be your epiphany, be your hero
I will slay the vampire for you

[Verse 2]
A prisoner for love, a prisoner for love
For you, I stand as tall as an empire
With my heart on my sleeve and my head in a dream
A-A-A victim of your art, convicted from the start
For you, I fall just like an avalanche
With my heart on my sleeve and my head in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
I would run a hundred miles, a hundred miles
When my love's in the ocean and my head's in the clouds
I would swim a thousand laps, a thousand laps
Girl, I can be your knight in shining armor
Riding on my chariot, Marlon Brando

[Chorus]
I will be your samurai, Marlon Brando
I will slay the vampire for you (Aye-aye, aye, aye)
I will be your epiphany, be your hero
I will slay the vampire for you

[Sample: Chris Brown & Marlon Brando]
Horror! Horror has a face and you must make a friend of horror  (For you, Marlon Brando)
Horror and moral terror are your friends (It's for you, babe, Marlon Brando)
If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared (For you, Marlon Brando)

[Bridge]
For you, for you, yeah
I will be your samurai, oh, babe
And I will slay the vampire for you
For you, for you, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I will be your samurai, Marlon Brando (I will be)
I will slay the vampire for you (For you, baby)
I will be your epiphany, be your hero (Yeah, I wanna be your)
I will slay the vampire for you (With you, yeah)

[Outro]
For you, oh-oh, babe (Baby)
For you, for you and for you (For you, for you, for you)
It's for you babe, for you (For you, for you, it's for you)
You, it's for you (For you, it's for you, baby)

[Verse]
Girl, I love what you are wearing, babe
Girl, it's the perfect time, to take you out tonight
We can make everybody jealous
'Cause my love and kisses are for you tonight
Get it all, baby
Lovin' in the foreign getting naughty
We ain't even gonna make it to the party, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
When me and you alone
Got you turning off your phone
Loving in the car, before we get to my place

[Chorus]
I just wanna kiss you right upon them lips
A drink of this vodka, take a sip
Love the way that that dress fits on your hips
Girl, it's giving me problems
Oh, I'm driving, swerving
Switching lanes, I'm nervous
Sorry if I get a little bit naughty
I-I-I-I want you, I-I-I want you
I-I-I-I want you, I-I-I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
When me and you alone
Got you turning off your phone
Loving in the car, before we get to my place

[Chorus]
I just wanna kiss you right upon them lips
A drink of this vodka, take a sip
Love the way that that dress fits on your hips
Girl, it's giving me problems
Oh, I'm driving, swerving
Switching lanes, I'm nervous
Sorry if I get a little bit naughty
I-I-I-I want you, I-I-I want you
I-I-I-I want you, I-I-I want you

[Verse 1]
Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You brought me in
You brought me in
So touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To keep myself from burning out

[Chorus]
They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who killed my mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins

[Verse 2]
Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You brought me in
My best friend
So touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To hold my sin
And kiss the bad ways I have been

[Chorus]
They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who's killing our mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins
It's in me, it's in me, in my veins

[Verse 1]
I saw you in the mirror
You been stuck inside my mind since Saturday
Can't get you off my radar
You're lost inside my heart, I can't escape
I'm falling for you, I'm running from you
If I could lock you up and have my way
I'd drive you up to Bel Air
Let's escape, come here next to me, oh

[Chorus]
If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind

[Verse 2]
My heart is getting hazy
I wish you'd whisper words into my ears
I know I sound so crazy
I want to keep you close to kiss my tears
I'm callin' for ya, I dial your number
But you never pick up when it's my name
So I drive up to Bel Air
And drown inside the pool out on the deck

[Chorus]
If you were mine
We'd take a holiday away from here
But you don't care
I never crossed your mind
Time passes by
Alone in paradise
You'll always be a fantasy
I never crossed your mind

[Verse 1]
It's less hard than it should be to find a dead guy dressed up as Batman
His penis out, with a magazine
And a Go-Gurt hanging out of his mouth but you know

[Chorus 1]
We say "hey now, this is America"
We got some time to kill, and we need a thrill
So we die doing the dumbest of shit, here we go

[Verse 2]
We got people hanging out at abandoned malls
T
