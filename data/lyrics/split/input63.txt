Thank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible
Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun
I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby

[Adele]
Thank you very much. Thank you. First of all, I really do apologize for swearing. I just... this means... George Michael, I love him, it means a lot to me, so I'm really sorry if I offended anyone anywhere.

Everyone, this is Greg Kurstin. Give it up for Greg Kurstin. Thank you very much for this award. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to my record labels XL and Sony, thank you to my manager, Jonathan. I always get so nervous... And I'd like to thank Greg, because Greg kept coming to England for me, to work with me. And I was really hard work this record, had a very short attention span, and he would come to me in England so that I didn't have to leave my son, and yet you would leave your son and daughter. So thank you for your patience with me and for helping to create my favorite song I've ever done. So thank you, Greg

[Greg Kurstin]
...Thank you to my mom and dad...

[Verse 1]
Boy, this could be your year
Make an old man proud of you, forget about the tears
On the level, see me eye-to-eye
Stand up like a man even from the other side

[Chorus]
On the level
On the level

[Verse 2]
Man, I never had a choice
Never had a chance, never had a voice
On the level, carrying a name
Fall until my final day, now, who's there left to blame?

[Chorus]
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level
On the level

[Verse 1]
One of the greatest of them all
Dogg Sinatra
In pocket with the rocket, I got ya
Awe and amazement
Flippin through my pages
I live my life lit up
Lighting up these stages
Ridiculous, outrageous, greatness, contagious
Still on top, lookin' ageless
I plan my play then scheme it out
Draped up, caked up, all day, I dream about
Protecting my position
I did it my way, no preventions, or no permissions
Listen

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Fingers I flick it, let you figure this out
Snoop Dogg and I'm back in the house
Superstar, Snoopy hard and he came with the flow
Adidas on my feet, hi top or low
No matter where I go, I get a check in a plane
When you speakin' on me, dog, put respek on my name
Worldwide with the heat life
I was brought up the street life
They love it cause I does it with them 3 stripes
The big drug beater, gotta stay cheetah, me and my 'Didas
Yeah
This important
No Jordans
No-no-n-n-no!
(Outro: Crowd of people and Snoop Dogg)
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
It's the only way
Ya dig?

[Chorus: Wurld]
Hello friend, how you been?
I know we've been lost and out of touch
We were young, and we both sinned
We've been on a road that has no way out
For the first time I can say
Middle finger to the world
For the first time I can say
Middle finger to the world

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
There's dirt on my name 'cuz I'm a diamond in the rough
My cup runneth over it's time to get a bigger cup
Lookin' for innocence in a world that's corrupt
Can a nigga just adjust?
I don't have a lot of friends I just know a lot of people
So numb to backstabbers all I feel is pins and needles
Perception is reality depends how they receive you
Anyone can sell a story it depends if they believe you
I, I never doubt shit
Don't know where the ground went
Lookin' for peace
On some lost and found shit
Don't let other people's opinions
Overshadow your own feelings
All I, all I all I see is vultures
So many posers out there all I see is sculptures
All I, all I all I see is vultures
People who love they job more than they love the culture
Makin' decisions
On who gets to listen
Or how many spins
Rap politicians
Fuck a chart this is art
Poison dart to your heart
Are you ready on your mark?
On a voyage I embark

[Chorus: Wurld]
Hello friend, how you been?
I know we've been lost and out of touch
We were young, and we both sinned
We've been on a road that has no way out
For the first time I can say
Middle finger to the world
For the first time I can say
Middle finger to the world

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Ain't no rap-battlin' sack-straddlin'
Check-tattlin' back-paddlin'
Whack talentless half-masculine bitch
Niggas' hands out to get helped out 'til they switch
How foul can it get?
Damn
Look how they hated the monster that they created
The sponsors I used to have are no longer negotiatin'
Never would smoke on camera them commas was always baitin' me
Livin' two different lives the battle was to escape it, huh
I'd-I'd rather be a tree-rolling weed-smoking
Jet setting over three oceans
Blue bank roll cheese folding
Haters watch as they keep trollin'
Fake news I'mma keep scrolling
'Cuz when it comes to conspiracies
My nigga, I'm like the spokesman
So I hit them flows
Over hi-hats that sound like bicycle spokes
Breakin' societal code
Watch out lil' ho
Said watch out lil' ho
Trustin' these hoes
Is slicker than driving in snow
Bitches might lose control
Or they might hit this pole
I ain't wifin' them though
They lookin' for hubbies like Findin' Nemo
Wit' my day ones
On this side of the ropes
And the rest of the world can kiss my ass
Mistletoe

[Chorus: Wurld]
Hello friend, how you been?
I know we've been lost and out of touch
We were young, and we both sinned
We've been on a road that has no way out
For the first time I can say
Middle finger to the world
For the first time I can say
Middle finger to the world

[Chorus]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Distant when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so...

[Chorus]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Distant (oh) when we're kissing (yeah)
Feel so different (yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so...

[Chorus]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Bridge]
So cold, ooh
Distant (distant), when we're kissing (kissing)
Different (different)
Baby tell me how did you get so...

[Chorus]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus]
I don't understand
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Woah yeah
Woah yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1]
I know it’s hot
I know we've got
Something that money can’t buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, the same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don’t like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don’t like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don’t fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah...)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you’ve had
I guess you’re diggin' the show
Open the door
If you want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, the same me
Inside
Hey!

[Chorus]
If you don’t like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don’t like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don’t fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Breakdown]
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah, hey!
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed I can blow your mind, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me I’m too crazy
You can’t tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I’m the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!
Mwah!

[Chorus]
If you don’t like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don’t like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don’t fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

[Post-Chorus]
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I’m alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

[Verse 1]
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 2]
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Bridge]
Jump and we think - do it all in the name of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give

[Chorus]
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids

[Verse 1]
Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Verse 2]
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

[Pre-Chorus]
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

[Bridge]
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

[Chorus]
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
American teen (American teen)

[Outro]
American Teenager
And I'll be living this dream with you

[Chant]
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

[Verse 2]
I know I’m no genius of love
Don’t know where I belong
Maybe I’m deaf and dumb
Maybe I’m just a bum
Maybe I never loved
Don’t you go psycho 'cause
I want you for the world
I want you all the time

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(When you were fun)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(You made me run)
Pineapples are in my head
(To the seafront)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(You took the plunge)

[Verse 3]
Five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms 'round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won’t forget how you looked at me then

[Bridge]
I know I’m no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don’t I say it then?
I want you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

Riding on the silver salmon
She can ride the burning sky, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake now

[Chorus]
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Verse 2]
Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now

[Chorus]
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Bridge]
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I wanna fall wide awake now

[Chorus]
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
And only I can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
But only I can save me
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 1]
Tell me what I've gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
The truth is, you turn into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Verse 2]
I admit I made mistakes
But yours might cost you everything
Can't you hear me calling you home?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
The truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus/Outro]
The truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
Talking to myself

[Verse 1]
I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

[Verse 2]
They say that I don’t belong
Say that I should retreat
That I’m marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I’ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don’t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

[Verse 1]
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Verse 2]
You didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
And you just want to know you're being heard
But this is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Bridge]
This is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watching the wings cut through the clouds
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking of you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologized

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand

[Bridge: Chester]
Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody could wait up
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

[Outro: Mike & (Chester)]
So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
(Things we have to do that we can't stand)
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand
You will understand
You will understand

[Verse 1]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows lived
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an empty vow
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I knew I took it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

[Chorus]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right)

[Verse 2]
Told me "Kid, you're going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last"
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

[Chorus]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right , halfway right

[Bridge]
Na na na na na na na na
Nana nana, na nana nana
Na na na na na na na na
But I was already gone

[Outro]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
Na na na na na na na na
Nana nana, na nana nana
Na na na na na na na na
But I was already gone
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Verse 2 ]
The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

[Instrumental + Bridge]
(I do)

[Chorus/Outro]
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do
Well I do

[Verse 1]
Mama always told me don't you run
"Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone"
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Verse 2]
Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Bridge]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Outro]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Must've been crazy to think that you loved me
I saw all the signs but I just couldn't say nothing
I did the time across the line for you
'Cause I can't see myself with nobody else but you
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
Should've been the one to hold me when I got lonely
'Cause every time I think of the lies you told to me
Make it easy for me to leave

[Chorus]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I was ridin' wherever you going
At times, I wanted to leave, but didn't wanna be lonely
Can't deny the fact you were my one and only
Love that I would do, only love I knew
And now I gotta turn my back 'cause you didn't realize that, boy
This was a real thing
And I just can't deny the fact we don't belong together
Guess it ain't the real thing

[Chorus]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

[Bridge]
Gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
Gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
There's so much to learn
When we trust the love that's deep in us
Then love will return (yes, it will)
Boy this thing was, a love lesson

[Chorus]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me

[Outro]
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

Slap hoes, cane pimps, No Slick Pulla

Poppin' on the radio, boy that's a bitch step
Ridin round with HB, smokin' on the cheap junk
Played you on a verse, 'cause I know you was a big crab
Paid Lil Will to sing the hook for a fifty slab

You deserve an Oscar
Album ain't hot, Def Jam finna drop ya
Hangin' round the Ball Park

Old ass Ferrari, you bought that shit from Pull-A-Part

Think ya on cause ya brung yourself a bird or two?
Outside 285 no one has heard of you

[Verse 3: Black Magic]
You can check my Glock work, pussy you ain't got these

They don't ask questions
They just shoot till the clip clean
Now let me tell y'all something quick
That fat nigga he dissed
Fuck around and say the word
His ass is 6'6"
And imma treat his ass just like a bitch
So all that text message banging ain't the trade of a Crip
I got the hundred round clip, with the MAC-10 under my trench coat
If I don't find Jeezy
I can always catch Coach
Popping all that shit, spreading "he say, she say"
Gon earn you a gangsta in ya grill like ya DJ
My whole team RD, flags on the left side
Gucci got the East
Black Mag on the westside
You Def Jammin' with that fat limp nigga
Ya both A.S.S. so you belong with Jigga

Stephen Marley, let 'em know what time it is

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
We came here to party, we came here to dance
You know that you're my girl, damn right I'm your man
This night going too good, don't fall for the games
Or the he said, she said dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under
But I know what this could be
Tearing up my history for you

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?
I got, I got, I got, I got options
You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Been around the game, been around the fame
Been around the money, been around some names
But the chico's still the same, some things never change
Here's a tip, show me your friends
I'll show you your future, keep the change
I've seen 'em come and go, I've seen 'em sell they souls
You my number one draft pick, baby, let's pick and roll
I always keep you up, up on a pedestal
Misery loves company, baby, don't sweat these hoes

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
They looking for the perfect man
They looking for the perfect life
They take some perfect pics
They want some perfect dick
But there ain't nothing perfect, girl
No such thing as a perfect world
These broads try hard to be
Who they not and not who they are
Baby, you sweating what? Baby, you sweating who?
You talking 'bout such and such who tries to be you?
Man, you JFK, mami, you out your mind
Misery loves company, I'll tell you one more time

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers
But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you
Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under

You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem

[Verse One]
I think I've gone and lost my mind
Thinking way too much
Even when there's time
Welcoming confusion
When the wheels touch down
Pass on public transit
Cause there's too much sound

[Verse Two]
I overused my jet-lag lie
Feeling so accused
Wasting most of the night
Eyes are crashing like a wave
Feet are heavy now
I am a walking cliché
I think I'll stay inside
Think I'll stay inside

I say bye (I say bye)
And goodnight (And goodnight)
I say bye (I say bye)
And goodnight (And goodnight)
I know I have to be alone inside
I know I have to be alone inside
I know I have to be alone inside
I know I have to be

[Intro]
I don't want nobody else but you

Nobody else but you, ooh ah ah

[Verse 1]
She like what's up, what's up with me and you, (ooh ah) yeah

I know you don't want to wait for me, aye
They say you should stay away from me, (no) aye

Gratefully you love me too (ooh ah ah)
Know a lot of men would do you better
Know that I done put you through whatever
I know that you care for me, I know you'll be there for me
If ever something happen you still down
Real one, I guess I'm just a fool with her
Looking in the mirror like, ain't you scared to lose her?
Why you acting like another man wouldn't choose her?
You know she the only true girl, ooh girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't even lie yeah you got me falling (fall)
Even when I try and the game keep calling (call)
Why we in the club, why I'm always ballin' (ball)
Tryna' be in love, we don't fall too often
It's hard to (fall), but you got me falling (fall)
Even when I try and the hoes keep calling (call)
Why we in the club, why I'm always ballin' (ball)
Tryna' be in love, we don't fall too often

[Verse 2]
They catch us on the low and I know you hate that (true)
They say that I'm yours and you say it ain't that (true)
And every time it goes I just bring the pain back, yeah
Break ups to make ups that-that's just the way it goes (ooh ah ah)
Know a lot of men would do you better (ooh ah)
Know that I done put you through whatever (ooh ah)
I know that you care for me, I know what you spared for me
I know you won't wait on me forever (noooo)
Real one, I guess I'm just a fool with her
Looking in the mirror like, ain't you scared to lose her?
Why you acting like another man wouldn't choose her?
You know she the only true girl, ooh girl

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
God is gracious, God is good
I thank God I made it out the hood
Misguided, misunderstood
Eyes red like Riding Hood
Though around my hood, I probably don’t get the hoorah I should
Cause I don’t sound as Atlanta I sound as hood
I ain’t sound as gutter I wasn't around the crooks
I should write a book called Anti-Social
Circles so small that the shit’s an oval
I don’t know I guess I’m not as soulful
I don’t know I guess I’m not as local
I don’t know I guess I’m way to boastful
All these shows man I way too global
Trusting these hoes man I’m way too hopeful
Speaking my mind man I’m way to vocal
And I’m way too loco
And it’s crazy how niggas can see their self
When they look at you and believe their self
In the ring you the people’s champ
Till they see them rings and they see them belts
Now you done bossed up with your conceited self
Changed up, you need to be yourself
Whatever the fuck that is
And fuck this rap shit
Whatever the fuck that is
It’s more to Atlanta than just being a dumb black nigga and a slum black kid
It’s more to Atlanta than just being a conscious rapper with some content
On a compact disc in a backpack with some nappy ass hair
Just so you can feel more black
Fuck it I’m back
Bobby Ray Bands

[Hook]
See I was just the average Joe
I coulda had an average job
Was hungry and I wanted more
But back then I had it all
Before I drove the fancy cars
Before I smoked with all the stars
Was hungry and I wanted more
Back then I had it all
Back then I had it all
Back then I had it all
My family ain’t gon’ never starve
Back then I had it all

[Verse 2]
Back then they didn’t want me
Now I’m on, they still phony
Fake cool, fake dudes, fake beef and they still cloning
And I’m still lonely
They be taking shots at the big homie
It’s still lonely up top
And I'm the only friend that I got
They say they sleepin’ on me
It’s a bunch of undercovers
Undercover cops, undercover brothers
I ain’t one to judge you, I’m just saying there’s a lot of niggas covered up behind a color and a chopper
True colors, where is Cyndi Lauper?
Niggas know that you were not a mobster
Only bricks you've seen is cinderblocks, boy
Writing fiction but you’re not an author
Lookin’ left, stiffin’ up your posture
Wait, I’m getting off of topic
Got a label, we don’t claim a genre, bitch
Cause it ain’t a genre
Whole roster chock-full of Rastas
I been medicating so much lately
Every day I got a different doctor
God damn

[Hook]
See I was just the average Joe
I coulda had an average job
Was hungry and I wanted more
But back then I had it all
Before I drove the fancy cars
Before I smoked with all the stars
Was hungry and I wanted more
Back then I had it all
Back then I had it all
Back then I had it all
My family ain’t gon’ never starve
Back then I had it all

[Intro: Nai Palm & Drake]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you

[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 3: Drake]
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me, "Pay it no mind"
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die

[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 4: Drake]
Hidden Hills where I post, yeah
'Ye already know, yeah
I'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood
Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah

[Intro: Pitbull & Kiesza]
Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life
It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride
Let's show everybody why love is a battlefield
Tell them how you feel

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally
But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me
I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible
Presidential debates unreliable
Politicians want to politick and politrick
That's why I call this shit politricks
I'm a young man, old soul
I can't listen to this new school shit
To me it's just so-so
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s
Took over the game and they thought we were crazy
You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it
Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming
David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed
I learned from the worst, but listened to the best
Figure out that riddle and figure out success
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

[Intro: Pitbull]
You have to have vision to understand love is blind, talk to ‘em Ty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Verse 1]
Got a room with a mirror on the roof
Down in the keys keys keys
And I could bet the bank and almost guarantee
That you will always look better on me
I handle my business in the boardroom and the bedroom
My name ain't max but I always got headroom
G-g- get it, g-g- g-g- get it
Went from selling perico and reefer
To New Year's Eve with Snoop and Latifah
I shut down Spain
And I ain't even have to take a pill in Ibiza
I'm a beast bro
I love when you put on them sexy one piece outfits
With the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror
And see you always look better on me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I'm allergic to the fake and these negative crabs
So get from me with your negative ass
I live for the future, you live in the past
Found somebody else, I hope that it lasts
But you know that I know that we know that you'll be thinking bout me
But you know that I know that we know that you look, that you look better on me
I ain't here to sell ya, I'm here to tell ya, all I've ever done is learn from my failures
So god bless mami, cause God knows I wish you the best mami, that's right
I love when you put on that sexy one piece outfit with the hole in the middle
Now take a look in the mirror and see you always look better on me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's been a while and you found somebody else
They say you really doing good for yourself
But I know you out there feeling so lonely
As far as my eyes can see
Don't need no proof or no validation
You leave no wound on you second to none
You said you over me but you looking lonely
So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
You look better on me
Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw
As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got the flow that took over the globe, yeah
I got the cribs on the island for sure, yeah
I got the jet fueled up, ready to go
I put my money where my mouth is
I got the bread to blow
Baby believe me, baby you need me
Don't deceive me, then we'll be straight
And whenever you see me
Baby just tease me
I like a little foreplay, yeah that's great
Now you're thinking that you know me
But you don't 'cause I do things these men won't
These boys act like they're ballers
But they ain't
I definitely do the things that they can't
I'm in my own world, girl, no rules, no laws
No thongs, no bras
Now show me that sexy body, baby, I wanna see it all

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby

A piece of that sexy body

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
S for the sex

X, forget about your ex
Y, 'cause baby, I'm up next
B for the best
O for the one
D 'cause I'm down
Y, yolo, done
Home run, grand slam
I am, the man
You're the biddy-bing-bing-bang-bang, that thang
Now I'm actin' a fool, girl ain't no rules
Why hit one when I can hit a few?
It's been like that since high school
If it ain't broke, why fix it? This shit, gon' gift it
Word to the wise; keep it long distance
Don't need assistance, so mind your business
I hit and run, but when it comes to a sexy body, you're the one

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
Got a feeling that maybe this just was  meant to be
Let's go, oh
Wanna feel you come in close like you belong to me
There's one thing I don't know

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body

[Intro: Leona Lewis & Pitbull]
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, for you to see
(Mr. Worldwide)
I don't care what they believe we should be
(Leona Lewis)
I won't run away 'cause I can't change how I feel
This is for those that never believed in what we got goin' on
We don't have to say a single thing about you and me
(We appreciate ya'll)
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
(Sing it to 'em, Leona)
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
(Let's ride)
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I see you baby (Yeah)
I wanna feel you baby (Yeah)
Sexy to hear you baby
Just keep your lips like the Navy, and seal them baby
I live a life that movies are made of
Sex, money, power and mayhem
These boys ain't' players, they need to get their game up
They can't even hit a lay up

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Forget the Facebook, forget the Twitter
Forget the Snapchat, forget the Instagram
Baby I got a master plan
Gingerbread man, catch me if you can

[Chorus: Leona Lewis]
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Baby let's get away and enjoy paradise together
And if you understand my vision
Then we could knuckle up and take on the world together
I've lived this life forever
No one has to know how we move
No one has to know what we do
Just me and you
Just you and I
Bonnie and Clyde
Step on the gas, let's ride

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Forget the Facebook, forget the Twitter
Forget the Snapchat, forget the Instagram
Baby I got a master plan
Gingerbread man, catch me if you can

We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know

[Bridge: Pitbull]
They're mad
Because they can't do the things that we can
And they never been the places we've been
That's right, all they do is talk shh....
They're mad
Because they can't do the things that we can
And they never been the places we've been
That's right, all they do is talk shh....

[Chorus: Leona Lewis]

[Chorus: R Kelly & Austin Mahone]
I wanna take love out, I wanna buy love drinks
I want to have a good time, I wanna show love things
I wanna hold love's hand, I wanna bottle love up
I want to dance with love 'til the sun comes up
I wanna be with love, I wanna touch love, I'm in love with love
I wanna walk for love, I wanna trust love, I need your love
I wanna treat love right
Love this is your night (hey DJ!)
This is dedicated to love

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I can tell by the way that you talk
And the things that you say, that you know what you want, for sure
I can tell by the way that you walk, that you know what you're doin'
That turns me even more
I can tell that you're passionate, and love crazy sex, yes
I can tell that you have an open mind and love to have a good time, yes
Baby I was built a little different (different)
I was raised by a real life (real life)
Let me show you what love is, I promise it'll change your life

[Outro: R Kelly & Mahone]

Cause this is dedicated to love
I'm gonna bet my money on love

Pour some more in my cup
'Cause this is dedicated to love
'Cause this is dedicated to love
This is dedicated to love

[Verse 1]
I don't care
"Take a chance," you said
Melt the coins in your pants
But make no sound for me my friend
Be calm in the wind
Tearing through town
A dog-less bark
Is a lonely sound
The cold ground moans
Untold histories
It sings its birdsong
To me

[Chorus]
A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

[Verse 2]
We waste no time
Leaving in light
A different sun
Bakes the breeze tonight
My mind wanders
Alone
Let my body
Be aquatic
Burn us a road
Straight to the sea
I'll be your seatbelt
Baby

[Chorus]
A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

[Outro]
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

I think I'll die

Sky will crucify
Tear little holes in my lungs

Everyone's lives with his breath
Charged with particles
Doom City air rips me up
Unbelievable
Doom City sky makes him laugh

Doom City
Doom City
Doom City

[DJ Semtex]
When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history

[Drake]
It’s been a while, that’s kinda how we ended up here. When I got here 

[London], I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and I’m watching this kid, it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like “man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again”. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me, and that’s how we’re here

[DJ Semtex]
How’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…

[Drake]
Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here”
That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about

A lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’…
Since we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…

[Drake]
Its taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” (laughs), so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax

You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque
So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path

[DJ Semtex]
So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to …

[Drake]
Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that

So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it

[DJ Semtex]
Did you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year

[Drake]
It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …

[DJ Semtex]
How did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…

[Drake]
I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool”

I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it

I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song

[DJ Semtex]
With ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?

[Drake]
Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…

[DJ Semtex]
On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?

[Drake]
I don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs

[DJ Semtex]
So with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?

[Drake]
Oh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line (laughs), that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke

[DJ Semtex]
When did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?

[Drake]
Man you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time

You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that

And shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business

Yeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …

[DJ Semtex]
How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour..

[Drake]
Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given time

[Verse 1]
Hey kid, everybody's prone to some mistakes
If you'd always kept it straight, you'd never learn
You'd run the risk of all the risks you take
Don't feel like all the time you put in went to waste
The way your heart was beating all those days
And suddenly it beats another pace

[Chorus]
It's not like you'd ever try to forget her
But these days are better without one another

[Verse 2]
Hey man, so now you've got it off your chest
Your heart can finally get some rest
Same heart that started this whole mess
And although, a broken heart needs time to mend
Yours wasn't ever really broken, was it?
You lose a love, you gain a friend

[Chorus]
It's not like you'd ever try to forget her
But these days are better without one another

[Outro]
Without one another
Without one another
Without one another

[Verse 1]
I never meant to make her cry
And now I'm seeing tears in her eyes
Half and half, make believe
'Cause so she thought, well, my heart was on my sleeve

[Chorus]
Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Beating

[Verse 2]
Never thought some silly songs
Could ever go and hurt someone
I never meant to sing my tune
For anybody else out there but you

[Chorus]
Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it
Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it beating

[Verse]
Turns out not every dog has his day
So sad, so suddenly gone away
Wish there were more that I could do
Any time you're hearing this
Sister, know my heart goes out to you

[Verse 1]
Once your dreams
Come knocking at your door
It's time to realize
You aren't dreaming anymore
And once your life, is set to settle down
Take a look around you
No more dreaming to be found

[Chorus]
So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

[Verse 2]
Once a life believes it's got it set up
A closer look reveals
Just how empty you can feel
Once a dream
Is finally put to bed
Rest up, sleepyhead
You might as well be dead

[Chorus]
So why, then, are you crying?
It was you who denied them
And no amount of tears
Could roll back all the years
Bring back all your dreams from yesterday

[Verse 1]
Just trying to keep it light sometimes casts a shadow
Trouble is keeping quiet and you know well where your heart goes
Troubles with meeting anybody, these days are bringing you down
All predisposed to believe in, in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't let the world outside the windowpane get to your head
Hopefully make some sense of all this shit before you're dead
The troubles with meeting anybody, follow wherever you go
All predisposed to believe in, in a wolf who wears sheep's clothes
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Another turn, another shift
One last kiss from her lips
Another dream you're putting down
After all this time, it turns out all you found

[Chorus]
Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

[Verse 2]
Another try, another go
Never thought you'd feel this low
Another dream put to bed
After all this time, it turns all you had

[Chorus]
Is one more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart
One more love out to break your heart
Set it up just to watch it fall apart

[Verse 1]
I'd say, see you later, if I thought I'd see you later
And I'd tell you, that I loved you, if I did
It's so strange, deciding, how to feel about it
It's such strange emotion standing there beside it

[Chorus]
I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
Home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

[Verse 2]
I'd say, see you next time, if I thought there were a next time
Easy conversation, ain't exactly where we're at
It's so strange, deciding, how I feel about you
It ain't like I ain't used to going on without you

[Chorus]
I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies
I'm home, with moonlight on the river, saying my goodbyes
I'm home, there's moonlight on the river, everybody dies

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Haven't got the guts to call him up
Walk around as if you never cared in the first place
But if you never call you'll end up stuck
Without another chance to tell him off right to his face

[Chorus]
And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away

[Verse 2]
I know you never meant to put him down
And even if you did, he sure deserved it
The thought of him no longer being around
Well sure it would be sad but not really different

[Chorus]
And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Salt to taste
Salt for the little hole in that face
Better go
Thanks to the little bird who let me know
That's not you
How'd he tell you to I
Found you
What you
When you

He's all talk
He's just playing cards at the boardwalk
Watch that frown
Talk just a little bit to calm you down

[Verse 1]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy
Smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now?
It's over

[Verse 2]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was 70s in spirit, 90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now that it's over?
Baby, how you feeling now that I told you?

[Bridge]
It's you
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar?

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Honey, how you feeling now?
(How's life treating you now?)
That it's over
Baby, how's life treating you now that I told you?

[Outro]
Honey, how's it feeling now?
(Honey, how's it feeling? Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you
(Honey, how's it feeling? Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you

[Verse 1]
Of all the things you wished you'd never done
I've heard you say that this is number one
Another life down another road
Perhaps you're better off to never know

[Post-Chorus]
Don't dream of all the ways things could have been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean

[Chorus]
There's nothing to cry about
'Cause baby, baby, you're out

[Verse 2]
You've always felt it's hard to voice complaints
But what you voice is what will drive your fate
And though things never really got that bad
Dreams of greener grass'll drive you mad

[Post-Chorus]
Don't dream of all the ways things could've been
Remember all the faces you let in
Remember all the faces still unseen
And soon enough, you'll see just what I mean

[Chorus]
There's nothing to cry about
'Cause baby, baby, you're out

[Outro]
Baby, you're out
Baby, you're out
Baby, you're out

[Verse 1]
While she's been away
Living day-to-day has been tough
Without her at my side
Simply being alive has been rough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And though she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not trying to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

[Chorus]
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

[Verse 2]
The time she's not around
Somewhere out of town, has been hard
But somehow this old heart found time to work it out this far

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No, I know she's coming home soon
There are times I find it hard to feel that way
It's not inside me to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day

[Chorus]
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again

[Outro]
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
It's just like seeing her for the first time again
I love it, I don't care
Who's knocking on my ear?

I'm calling, but what am I supposed to say
She's okay, but somebody's gotta stay

Some secret kept I'll never let it go, you know
I'll never let it go
Some secret kept I'll never let it go, you know
I'll never let it go

Come closer, stop right there
So pretty it's not fair

What happened?
What are you gonna do?
Don't touch it, I don't want you to move

Some secret kept I'll never let it go you know
I'll never let it go you know
Some secret kept I'll never let it go you know
I'll never let it go you know
We love, we love, come again and rewind

If you're stuck in jail and you can't make bail
Let me hear you blow your horn
Yo, if you ain't gonna work 'cause your boss is a jerk
Let me hear you blow your horn
North, south, east, west, kill the stress
Let me hear you blow your horn
Yo, if you're ready for the master blaster
Everybody come on and come on and come on and come on and come on

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Everybody's looking jiggy
But it ain't jiggy no more
'Cause the world is full of problems
Young ones don't care if they live or die
Stevie: Hard time universe
From the latest hip-hop riddims
Biggie's hot on your box (yo, turn up your radio, kid)
Tonight there'll be a party
On the corner 'til the end of dawn

[Chorus:]
I bet you that you
Will be jammin' until the break of dawn
Nobody ever told me that you
You will be jammin' until the break of dawn
Nobody ever told me that

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
You ask me am I happy
Well as a matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination will be the brightest star

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
You would be jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Didn't nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
The wide world knows that you
(We're in the middle of the end of the master blaster jammin'!)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You'll be jammin' until the break of dawn
Jammin' on
He's not my baby's daddy (then who is he?)
He's not my baby's daddy (then who is he?)
He's not my baby's daddy (Yo, it's the master blaster)

[Rap: Wyclef]
Yo, I'm the boogie boogie bang, zikky zikky zang
Zorro pass the sword so I can cut the bwoy's hand
Mr. Man In Blue had me reroute my plan
When I'm vex I got patois like a Jamaican
For your girl, she's buff puff
Daytime, don't play rough
Freaks come out at night, so that's when I bring out the cuffs
Grand Marnier, CD player #2
Sade's in my bedroom singing Sweetest Taboo
Come on, come on, come on

If you're stuck in jail and you can't make bail
Let me hear you blow your horn
Yo, if you're ready for the master blaster, everybody come on
Yo, that's just my baby mother
Let me hear you blow your horn
North, south, east, west, kill the stress
Let me hear you blow your horns, come on

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
Oh, you would be jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Wyclef: Jammin' 'til the break of dawn until the sun come out
Didn't nobody ever tell you that you
Wyclef: You would
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Can't nobody ever... I'm tellin' you
We'll be jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Jammin' jammin' jammin' jam on

Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
I don't know what, but I feel it coming
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
I just hope she don't wanna leave me (Babe)

[Chorus]
Don't you give me up, please don't give up

[Bridge]
What if she's fine?
It's my mind that's wrong

Linger for far too long
What if (If) she’s fine? (Fine)
It’s my mind that’s wrong
And I just (Just) let bad thoughts (Thoughts)
Linger for far too long

Empty my bank account

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Put that spotlight on her face (Spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (Ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (Pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (Burn up)
Mama too hot like a (Like what?)
Mama too hot like a furnace (Furnace)

My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (Shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (Yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good lord

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (Info)
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it, went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'ma make a million on the average (M's)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrr)

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this? (Yeah)
Do you try on all your nights like this? (Oh)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (I might)

And buy that boy with a pipe (Ooh, yeah)
Buy that boy with a pipe (Come on, yeah)
I might, I might (Slide)
Empty my bank account (Ooh, slide)
And buy that boy with a pipe (Slide, yeah)

Buy that boy with a pipe

[Verse 1: Breezy Lovejoy]
When I met you up at Cafe Bleu
You had a cloud of smoke around you
It was 2 AM
You're sippin' on soup
Tuggin' on my coat tail
I was tuggin' on you

[Chorus: Breezy Lovejoy]

[Verse 2: Breezy Lovejoy]
Never seen an ass so round
Pretty brown hair to the ground
Make a young pimpin' say his vows
Met a girl in K-Town
Sool! Soju!
Two hands, old school
Never had a girl so down
Met a girl in K-Town
You only spoke a little bit o' English
But your shoe game was the meanest
A star cause you fresh outta FIDM
You ain't fuckin' with no nigga in a civic
Your daddy never really liked dark folk
But you don't know your daughter like I know
Said she make enough to pay the car note
And a condo somewhere on Serrano

[Chorus: Breezy Lovejoy]
Ha haaaaa
Haaaaa
What could I do with a K-Town girl (Ha ha haaaaa)

Met a girl in K-Town (met her out o' K-Town)
Sool! Soju!
Two hands, old school
Never had a girl so down
Met a girl in K-Town

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Ha
Three models surrounded by green bottles
Green bottles with labels of dream models
Second round  goin' down, please follow
After hours karaoke and end with King Taco
Oops! I mean El Taurino
Rosey cheeks lookin' redder than the sauce, pinche chinos
A couple hours ago we were dancin' up at VR
Booking girls to the table when I met a sweet heart
She told me that I wasn't like them other assholes
She got hit on by twenty dudes at Belasco
King of K-Town, roll to my castle
Three dollar cabs no hassle

[Chorus: Breezy Lovejoy]
Ha haaaaa
Haaaaa
What could I do with a K-Town girl (Ha ha haaaaa)
(K-Town girl, haaaaa)

Fuck around in K-Town
Sool! Soju!
Two hands, old school
Never had a girl so down
Fuck around in K-Town

[Intro]
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together

[Verse 1]
We both know but we don't talk about it
Lock it up in our hearts
Wrap disguises ‘round it
This is our secret
On the tip of our tongues like a gunshot
Can’t just kill this
No, no, no, ah
Try to hide how we feel about it
In the night you’re the dream on repeat in my head
This is our secret
‘Round in circles we go
Now I'm letting you know I need it
Hello, hello

[Chorus]
All this time, I can't believe
You've been here all along reflecting back at me
Eyes were blind but now I see
You've been here all along reflecting back at me

[Post-Chorus]
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one

[Verse 2]
When we touch, sky turns ultraviolet
Roses glow, spectrum blooms
I see colours shining
We're feeling perfect
Lucky chance, gonna last
Now we both know it was worth it
Hello, hello

[Chorus]
All this time, I can't believe
You've been here all along reflecting back at me
Eyes were blind but now I see
You've been here all along reflecting back at me

[Post-Chorus]
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one

[Bridge]
All this time we've been wasting
Caught up, now we're melting
Gold rush pours into my brain
And now we're reflecting
And I know, and I know, I know, I know, know
That we're not letting go, you're locked in my memory
Eh, eh, eh, eh, yeah
All this time we've been wasting
Caught up, now we're melting
Gold rush pours into my brain
And now we're reflecting
And I know, and I know, I know, I know, know
We've been blind all along but now we see perfectly
Eh, eh, eh, eh, yeah

[Chorus]
All this time, I can't believe
You've been here all along reflecting back at me
Eyes were blind but now I see
You've been here all along reflecting back at me

[Post-Chorus]
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one

[Outro]
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one
You're the light in the mirror
Shining bright like the sun
Coming closer together
Now I know you're the one

[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

[Verse 2]
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black
Throw on down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Your advice
Your advice

[Intro: The Weeknd]
I don't got a single sober vein in my body
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Don't apologize, I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy
And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide
Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy
All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom

[Hook: The Weeknd]
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
*Wiz laugh*
I got a lotta cash
I don't mind spending it

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death
I'm tryna make these bitches sweat
I'm tryna keep that pussy wet
I'm tryna fuck her and her friends

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
You gonna run it for these hunnids, girl, or nah?
Show me, is you really 'bout your money, girl, or nah?
Don't play with a boss, girl, take it all
Take it for a real one, you gon' get it all

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Is you really 'bout your money or nah?
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Oh nah, oh nah
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?
Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?
Oh nah
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Oh nah, oh nah
Would you ride for a nigga or nah?
Would you die for a nigga or nah?
Would you lie to a nigga or nah?
Oh nah

[Intro]
Yeah!
Ha
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Verse 2]
No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

[Chorus]
'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Bridge]
It's me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
You
Just me and you
You
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey…hey

[Chorus]
Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

[Outro]
It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Noooo....
Just me and you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

[Verse 2]
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

[Chorus]
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting

[Intro]
Cold blooded, cold blooded

[Verse 1]
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can’t feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Verse 2]
I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes (see it in your eyes)
That you're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Bridge]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Outro]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)

[Verse 1]
I lost my heart in the nighttime
She left me out in the cold
She left me broken and weary
Drunk off the lies she told
I fell in love in the morning
But when the day gets cold
I'm back to life in my lonely
City of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Verse 2]
I lost my mind when you left me
And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me
So I'll take my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit it
The feeling wasn't mutual
So I'm back to live on my lonely
In the city of El Paso

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Bridge]
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love (keep my love)
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love (keep my love)

[Chorus]
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

[Intro]
Something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to come off aggressive (no)
I'm just here to pass off the message (yeah)
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

[Chorus]
Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 2]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 3]
I hope I made the impression
That I was always interested
All the feelings I kept in
What should we do?
Whatever you want to

[Chorus]
'Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

[Verse 4]
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

[Bridge]
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala

[Verse 1]
Roses were your favorite flower
And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, because I wanted to be more than friends

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Verse 2]
We were ridin' down Dyer with my top down
Singin' our favorite songs
But the funny thing is
Every time we did, you'd always get the words wrong
And I was your biggest fan
You should never forget it
I bet your new man
Doesn't love you like I did
Does he love you like I did?
Does he love you like I did?
Noooo…

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive

[Bridge]
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Outro]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Verse 1]
I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

[Verse 2]
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

[Outro]
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ayy
Angels
Asked for an inch
And you gave me a foot, mom some
Times I don't get why you treat me so good
Even when I do you wrong
You forgive me every time
And you even like my songs
Thank you, and by the way

Mama, I love you
Mama, I love you
Mama, I love you
Mama, I love you
Part 1:

[Verse 1]
You think I don't notice
The look on your face
I can sense your emotions
From going through a phase

[?]Crazy places, you wanna just get away
But nobody is gonna go cause they don't wanna replace
Your ex is scary looking with a couple guns
He pulled one out and I ain't even run
That should tell you that I ain't afraid of death
So if you're feelin scared, just pray to God and take a breath

[Hook]
And smoke
Smoke
If you're feelin scared just pray to God
And smoke
(All you really, really gotta do is)
Smoke
Smoke
Smoke
Smoke
Smoke

Part 2:

[Verse 2]
Girl, when I miss you (when I miss you)
Get caught up (all in my feelings)
I wanna kiss you (when I kiss you)
Show you some love (love)
Show you some love (love)
I wanna show you some love
(Love, love, love)

[Verse]
If I'm at the beach
You know I'm with a bitch
If I'm in the 4
I gotta pop a swish
My girl hella thick
She snappin' hella pics
She said she don't smoke
I said "experiment"
Yes, I got some gas
I hide it in my stash
She wanted some for free
I told her kiss my ass
I be there for sure
She was hella mad
Then I smoked her out
And all we did was laugh

[Outro]
All we did was laugh
All we did was laugh
All we did was laugh

[Chorus]
Gone
I'm so gone
I'm so gone
I'm so gone
I'm so

[Verse]
Pulled up to the outing
And we off the loud
Feelin good, looking good
They said they fuck with my style
I kinda smiled, sat on the couch
And then I pulled out my phone
See  a text from my mom
Asking when will I be home (Where you at nigga?)
Prolly three, I don't know
That shit is always unknown
I heard a girl just said, "Excuse me, boy I like your cologne." (Ralph Lauren)
Probably thinks you tryna smash
I'm tryna get you alone
You know I'm kidding, would have said it
But was just too gone

[Chorus]
Gone
I'm so gone
I'm so gone
I'm so gone
I'm so

[Refrain]
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head

[Refrain]
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head
Can't get you outta my head

[Verse 1]
The same drink that gets me out the door
Is the same drink that puts me on the floor
And the new thing I wanna try some more
Is the same mistake I used to make before

[Chorus]
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

[Verse 2]
The same brain that brings me ecstacy
Is the same pain that gets the best of me
And the one I love the most just said to me
A broken heart is all I'll ever be

[Chorus]
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

[Bridge]
Help me
Help me
Help me

[Chorus]
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
Then I'll stop trying to figure it out

[Intro]
I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man

[Verse 1]
The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

[Chorus]
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

[Verse 2]
I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

[Chorus]
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man, oh mama
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man, your man

[Bridge]
(Ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met)
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, be—

[Chorus]
'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
(I still feel like) Still feel like your man (oh honey)
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man (And I don't know why)
Still feel like your man

[Outro]
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still, I still

[Verse 1]
Oh, honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do

[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Oh, honey
Oh, honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

[Verse 2]
Oh, honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good

[Pre-Chorus]
It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

[Bridge]
I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be okay
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

[Chorus]
Oh, honey
Oh, honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave, and I know
That when it comes
I just hold on until it's gone

Forgiatos on my car
You know I'm going hard
I brought it from the start
Where was hustlin' in the street
Came up from concrete
And we all gotta eat
They look at me 'cause I'm a star
I'm in the kitchen goin' hard

And now I'm ridin' foreign cars
Everywhere that I go
They know who we are
When I'm walkin' in the club
They showin' nigga love
So I'm buying out the bar

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
One last drink to drink wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in

Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

[Chorus]
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

[Verse 2]
The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

[Chorus]
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light
And roll it on home

[Chorus]
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Verse 1]
Too many nights to remember
So many girls, I can't count
Can't keep track of these adventures
What has become of me now?
I thought each one was special
Oh, who am I kidding?
Why do the things feel so good?
That are so forbidden, okay
That's enough of child's play
I think it's time to settle down
But the game won't let me out

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling all kinds of pressure
My momma wants another grandchild
Can't say I'm not making the effort
But these women keep calling me out
I guess I'm losing this battle
Oh, I'd be trippin'
Why do things that feel so good?
Put me in this position, okay
That's enough of child's play
I think it's time to settle down (settle down)
But the game won't let me out

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still (I'm still)
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up (lay up)
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Bridge]
Goes down way too many times in my DM
Gave me way too many signs, I ain’t see them
I just hope that I ain't too late
I just hope that I ain't sealed my fate
Oh baby, can I, can I pick it up?
Can I get back the love?
I really want to change my life
Girl, there's nothing that I want more now
But the game won't let me out

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up (lay up)
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Intro]
Yeah, I got you boo
Together forever, man any problem that you got, bitch I got it too
Together forever, man any problem that you got, bitch I got it too
Wheezy beats

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (Different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (Just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home

[Verse 1]
Hop out the Bent and into the coupe
Fuzz hit my family, they switchin' it up
It ain't nothin' I could do (Nothin' I could do)
My trust is fucked up
I ride with that wooly, I pour my own juice
Just in case a nigga look on me, and try run up on me
I'ma fuck with the cougars
Elliantte gon' flood me, man fuck it I'm stuntin' on you
I hope you lay down and remember that I was just gunnin' for you (Fool)
They told me that I was gon' end up like MC Hammer
'Cause everything I get, I try to invest it in you
You too and you too
In the daytime a nigga havin' nightmares
I wonder if he answerin' every one of my prayers
Hate to say it but I go broke 'bout anyone of my peers
You ain't gon' never change this shit
Yea, I'm bustin' down, yeah
Every single mothafucker 'round me wrist just gon' bust down, bust down
Ain't gon' get no second chance, you crossed me
I don't give a fuck about you
Yea, I'ma give up on you
Yea, I'ma hit the clutch 'bout you (Skrt)
I'ma throw it up by ya, yea, you better have luck by ya
Can't nobody ever beat the triple cross
I got snake in my veins, snake in my drawls
I got snake on my attire, snake inside my wounds
I put snakes around your eyes and, man, you gon' move

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (I spend more money)
Just to be safe, dawg
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe)
Gotta make it home

[Verse 2]
And I just wanna make it back to my kiddies
And I just wanna sit back and count these digits
Don't plan on lettin' nobody take their place
I pay more money to security than I make
And it's crazy but it's safe
I get to run around in peace everyday
I know my niggas go monkey like Bathing Ape
I tried to tell you, but you had to learn late
I was just holdin' you down and you didn't stay down like you 'posed to
I had you rollin' around in that Bentley Mulsanne and the Rolls too
I had you glossin' on all of these bitches just like you was 'posed to
I got you latest Chanel, and the latest Fendi, and the Gucci too
I told you, I love you forever
I'm never gon' change, I'm not stoppin', boo
I told you, I was gonna keep your lil' bank account full
And your pocket too
I start at your ear, I'ma lick it, then fuck around and end at the bottom, boo
Together forever, man
Any problem that you got, bitch, I got it too

[Chorus]
I'll cock it back, I'm ready to fire that chrome, hey
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (Different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe (Just to be safe)
Just to be safe, dawg (Just to be safe, dawg)
I spend more money on security than I make
Just to be safe, dawg
Gotta make it home

[Verse 1: Syd the Kid]
Penny for your thoughts, I know what you want
I can read your mind even from behind
And fuck what's in your phone, lemme take you home, I wanna take you home

Cause it's so rare that I'm here, don't plan on staying too long
So you should come here, sit your ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am, who I am

[Chorus: Syd The Kid]
I bet this Patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice girl your cover's blown
But you already knew that
You already knew that
You already knew that

We can burn one
We can burn one

[Verse 2: Suave the Performer]
Pause, who that walking through the door?
I don't come here often, but I seen you here before
I can't read your mind, but I can feel you from behind
And I don't see you purring, but I know that you been lying
'Cause the things that you been wearing and the way that you been sighing
Got me feeling like a guey, and you know that I been trying
To take you out of here and head on over to the crib
And treat you to a dinner and a sip of Dr. Pibb
Lay you on the couch and let you show me what you about
You looking at your phone, but Suave here to take you home
You looking kind of tipsy and I know you need a ride
So hop inside the line and maybe then I'll let you slide
'Cause you looking mighty fine, but what's been really on your mind?
I know a lot of people, and I really know your kind
If you really think you about it, then you really wasting time
'Cause I'm looking for ideas, and you really out of line (woah!)
And I can't even tell you who I am
I been around the corner and I always had a plan
I know a lot of people thinking Suave is the man
But I'm just another player in a bugger master plan (woah!)
And you think I'm playing games
But I sold away my CDs, now I got a better aim
And I'm scoping out the women that ain't trying to look the same
And she trying to take me home, but she don't even know my name

[Chorus: Syd The Kid]
I bet this Patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice girl your cover's blown
But you already knew that
You already knew that
You already knew that

We can burn one
We can burn one

You got control, and you love the game
But open my legs with the pressure and do it all again, yeah

You, I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)

[Verse 2]
I get drunk on the white wine
Call you, like a hotline
You’re stuck up in my mind
Not alright, what’s goin’ on?
Don’t usually do this
With you, I’m an addict
But open my legs with the pressure and candy floss kisses
Uh-huh, so good, but I know you’re bad for me
You got control, and you love the game
But open my legs with the pressure and do it all again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull up in a new thing, feel so cool up in your ride
Take drugs, what a waste, be racin’, love it when you drive
Bad boy make a bad girl, now that’s got my head so high
I’m feelin’ fuckin’ high, yeah, yeah
(I blame it on...)

[Chorus]
I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)
I blame it on you (yeah)
You, I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)
I blame it on you (yeah)

[Bridge]
Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl
Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl
Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl
Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl
Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl
Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl

[Chorus]
I blame it on you, I blame it on you
Every lie you tell comes true (true)
But I still wanna be with you (you)
I blame it on you (yeah)
(Bad boy make a bad girl, bad boy make a bad girl…)
You, I blame it on you, I blame it on you

But I still wanna be with you (you)

Mind
Mind

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

When I got racks I stacked my pile up, real high
Drainin' out my dick just like a termite

But what if my life turn cold? (brrr)
And what if your brains were froze?
I know you won't listen to me
And if I catch that rat bitch she fixin' to bleed
And see you when you in the street
I count it, fat like a geek
She know my bankroll on fleek
She want eat me before she eat
I cannot stop and don't stop
And she sucking me loose I can't breathe
She scratching up her knees
I'm like this can't be

[Chorus]
I stacked the racks it's perfect timing, damn right
Got off my ass and climbed that mountain, day and night
When I got racks I stacked my pile up, real high
Drainin' out my dick just like a termite
(ay) termite , (ay ay) like a termite
She slobbin' on my dick like she a termite
That's that termite, I call her termite
I drain all of these bitches like a termi-i-ite

She slobbin' on my dick like she a termite
That's that termite, I call her termite
I drain all of these bitches like a termi-i-ite

Be my Halle Berry, all you need is a catsuit

Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up; we all know that
In fact, niggas missing the action, where are they at?
See, you niggas never really been ducked out
But got enough mouth to get snuffed out; roof the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we're grown
Start applying pressure, give the dog a bone
I'm taking half; it's just that simple
Or I can start popping niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you're staggering and fallin'

[Verse 1]:
Steve Lacy is killin shit
I'm one nigga that's dealin shit
I'm into icy businesses
You've seen images of my wristses
I flexed up on the judge in court
I told her ass, "Bitch, case dismissed."
And pulled out in Ferrari and my all-denim Versace fit
I'm flexin
Young nigga prolly pulled up in a Lexus
No more stressin
Young nigga pockets lookin like Precious
I'm sending out blessings
When you see that Jesus necklace
I got goons that do own choppas
You can be added to the checklist

[Hook]
That's crazy, huh?(x8)

[Verse 2]
Back up in this bitch
Like body part up yo ass, huh?
Yeah, I run this shit
But I gotta check cause I got asthma
White hoes, Black hoes
Feel like I own pandas
Keep that gold wrapper on me
I ain't takin no chances
Silly boy, aren't I?
See me in them archives
Nigga you can't turn a thot
Into a housewife
Bass effect on overdrive
I'm shocked as fuck, super surprised
I made this shit sober
But I'm usually fuckin high

[Hook]:
That's crazy, huh?(x8)
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for

Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two

Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap

People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'

Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn

Why - why - why?

Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (people on streets) edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
Jay-Z: In this day and age-

Frank: Yeah.

Jay-Z: I just don't know...

Frank: Yeah, yeah.

Jay-Z:Take radio for instance. It's pretty much an advertisement model. You take these pop stations, they're reaching 18-34 young white females. So they're playing music based on those tastes. And then they're taking those numbers and they're going to advertising agencies and people are paying numbers based on the audience that they have. So these places are not even based on music. Their playlist isn't based on music. If you think a person like Bob Marley right now probably wouldn't play on a pop station. Which is crazy. It's not even about the DJ discovering what music is best. You know, music is music. The line's just been separated so much that we're lost at this point in time. They have to revolutionize that thing, you know, be more progressive. I think with all the technology and where we are today, it's definitely a more efficient way to get music out.

Because it's the whole idea behind having a festival that played all sorts of music. Because no one listens to music like that - you just listen to music more than ever. Back in the days there used to be hip-hop clubs. Like, specific hip-hop clubs. Now every club is a hip-hop club. Every club is a music club. You go in there, you're liable to hear EDM, hip-hop, you're gonna hear some soul, you’re definitely going to hear "Poison" around 2-3 in the morning.

It's unfortunate because with, you know, technology and everything moving forward, we should, it should be a better way that the music, the musicians, radio, and these things that are supposed to be instruments for the arts, should exist. And it shouldn’t be about advertisement. And it shouldn't be about—so the more times, you know, someone like yourself can bypass that, it’s better for the, for the arts. And it's better for the audience 'cause you have to have, like, a level of discipline and just a belief to put music out in this place where not everyone can.

Frank: Right.

Jay-Z: You know, people, like, they wanna shoot for that, and then they're making music that's not really conditioned who they are so they can reach a certain platform.

[Intro]
(Maybe my)
Eh-eh-XCX
(Maybe my, uhh)

[Verse 1]
Maybe my only light
Don’t you recognise
You’re the only one I want, uhh
Cold like ice, petrified, uhh
Loving what you’re doing to me
(Doin' to me)

[Chorus]
White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and movin’ slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

[Verse 2]
You’ll be mine every night
I’m trying to advertise
You’re the only one I want, uhh
Hold me tight, yeah, Marlboro Light, uhh
Loving what you’re doing to me

[Chorus]
White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and moving slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

[Bridge]
We’re gonna melt down
Gonna disappear into the sun, into the sun
Gonna burn down together like fire
We can’t get enough
(No, no, no, no)
We’re tied like white roses
You know we’re never coming undone, coming undone
'Cause I wanna stay forever
I know that you’re the only one, only one

[Chorus]
White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and moving slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

[Outro]
(Ooh, aah, yeah)
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

[Verse 1]
A material girl in her own world
Can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve, a little girl wanting to grow up and be a star
Take a look around, not looking down
All these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't amount to nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real

[Chorus]
It takes time, living in a world when you don't know who to trust
Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time, takes time, to love

[Verse 2]
And I'ma tell the truth when it comes to you, my lady
And it's a miracle you have found a conscience, baby
I had a plan on leaving, you came and gave a reason
And now I know the reason why, why

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know how you feel (You feel)
It's hard to see who's real (What's real, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh-woah)

[Chorus]
It takes time, living in a world when you don't know who to trust
Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time (Takes time), takes time (Takes time), to love

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
Is this the start of something wonderful and new?
Or one more dream that I cannot make true?

Barefoot, she smiled
And leapt, without looking
And tumbled into the Seine
The water was freezing
She spent a month sneezing
But said she would do it again

Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make

She told me:
"A bit of madness is key
To give us new colors to see
Who knows where it will lead us?
And that's why they need us"
So bring on the rebels
The ripples from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays

And here's to the fools who dream
Crazy as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
You never shined so brightly
The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

Quavo! I'm the one that hit that same spot (Hit it)

We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up (Bad)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)
'Cause I promise, when we step out you'll be famous (Yeah)
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us (Why?)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & DJ Khaled]

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
Yo, what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs
To not, act hard like I wouldn't jab y'all
You a trap-star, cool i'm a dream catcher
You from New York, stop biting off Atlanta
Pea is a rap terrorist, suicide bomber
I'ma blow up me and everybody around me
You can't show up pea im everywhere you try to be
Here's some advice get nice and don't lie to me
In my last 6 I trumped your whole shiznik
Son I've heard better MC'ing in limp bizkit
Rappers is rugrats, I am DR. Lipschitz
Come to ya shows theres enough space to park with
Wheres your fanbase, with so much damn grace
I plan your demise over eggs and pancakes
First thought of the day the second one goes
I won't stop until I see TM blow

[Verse 2: T.Dot]

[?]

[Verse 3: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)

[Verse 4: Drake]
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise

[Intro]
Bangladesh
So I'm just supposed to say some corny ish?
Haha, nah
Uh, yessir
It be that, it be that

[Verse]
It be that Breezy millionaire
A milli here and a million there
Sellin' out stadiums, million chairs
Steppin' on and off stage, killin' 'em
I got a million pair of them all white a million Airs
I am a beast, hurry competition, come please
Lock 'em up, lock 'em up
Just put 'em on freeze, on ice
I'm doin' things that rappers don't like
And I'm makin' a milli, a milli, a milli
And I'm makin' a milli, a milli
Gettin' money, just throw it up and watch it
And when it comes down, it's like magnets in my pockets
Damn, I got it
Purple and green diamonds, they swing from my chest
Bigger and bigger, man, I think the Hulk's on my neck
I'm brilliant, Jay-Z, Weezy, Breezy
So what's a million? Yeah (Woo!)

[Outro]
Singing niggas is just chill
Haha
'Cause I'm ill

[Verse 1]
You don't even call anymore
It's so different from the way it was before
Every day I hear your pretty voice
I have no choice but to be all alone without you
There's so many mistakes we make in love
'Cause still I'm thinking this is something we can solve
I'll take all the blame for breaking your heart
But you can't let it tear us apart because

[Chorus]
She didn't mean anything to me (Nothing)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams (Oh, no)
Girl, you know it ain't true, if you believe (Yeah)
Please accept my apology
Please accept my apology
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl

[Verse 2]
I didn't see myself settling down
But I knew from the first time you came around
From the moment I looked into your eyes
I never wanted to see you cry over me
But I knew if we got serious in love
We would never, ever wanna break it up
I wasn't ready for you until this day
Could you believe when I say that she—?

[Chorus]
She didn't mean anything to me (No, she didn't)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams (No she was not, yeah)
Girl, you know it ain't true, if you believe
Please accept my apology
Baby, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl
She didn't mean anything to me (No, woah)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams
Girl, you know it ain't true, if you believe
Please accept my apology, woah
I didn't mean to hurt you, girl

[Intro]
Haha, y'all wanna learn y'all ABCs?
ABC, haha, yeah
Y'all gon' like this right here
Yeah, yeah
Oh, counting on ABC
Counting on ABC (ABC)

[Verse 1]
There are so many ways to spell it out, I love you
But only one way to show you, mmm (One way to show you)
I can scale the mountain and yell it out 'til my face turn blue
But when I come back down, what did that prove? (All that, what did it prove?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I would rather let my day to day
Actions speak louder than what I say
But if I had to pick letters from the alphabet
I would say it this way

[Chorus]
A, oh yeah, maybe we can B something you can C
DEFinitely, I know you want a G
Who can take you HI (HI), higher than a J
What I'm tryna say
Is love is as simple as ABC (Ooh, ooh)
All you gotta do is sing with me

[Verse 2]
Since I've made it clear, you understand I wanna be with you
All I wanna know is if it's cool (Know is that cool?)
Now it would hurt me so if you said, "I know" 'cause I been on my Ps and Qs
And I've Xed all the rest, this man's only got eyes for YOU, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I would rather let my day to day (Day to day)
Actions speak louder than what I say
If I had to pick letters from the alphabet
It would go this way

[Chorus]
A, maybe we can B, oh girl, something you can C
DEFinitely (Definitely), I know you want a G (Know you want a G, yeah)
Who can take you HI (HI), higher than a J
What I'm tryna say is
Is love is as simple as ABC (Ooh, ooh)
All you gotta do is sing with me

Who can take you HI (HI), higher than a J (J)
What I'm tryna say
Is love is as simple as ABC (Ooh, ooh, love is)
All you gotta do is sing with me (Ha)

[Verse 1]
See the days are gone and I've been losing my mind
I'm crashing, I'm running out of time
Now the way that I perceive things, hoping you don't deceive me
But it's just the feeling inside that I
Had to find a way to find out, this relationship is about
Seems like you want to count me out
Mmm mmm, but you were the one who changed
Thought it would stay the same but it still remains

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a believer, the pain and the loss
Baby girl, I won't either, even though you might say both of us need a breather
Thought I had it all, had to take that fall
Baby, to let you know that
I'm a believer, the reason that you should stay is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
I wanna be your friend, we can win, I'm a believer

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, sit it down come around and take it straight up
Don't need to end my life, girl
I want you around there's no need to frown
Girl, give your love to me
I want ya, I need you
Every night and day, hoping that we stay together
But can I hold you in my arms?
Thought I was playing, I'm saying, baby girl

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a believer, the pain and the loss
Baby girl, I won't either, even though you might say both of us need a breather
Thought I had it all, had to take that fall
Baby, to let you know
I'm a believer, the reason that you should stay is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
I wanna be your friend, we can win

[Bridge]
Can you stop blaming me for it, just this once?
Can you commit to my love?
My heart's breaking down
Girl, you know that I will never leave your side, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a believer, the pain and the loss
Baby girl, I won't either, even though you might say, need a breather
Thought I had it all, had to take that fall
Baby, to let you know
I'm a believer, the reason that you should stay is to be that I need ya
The way I look at you as if I'm an achiever
We could love again
I wanna be your friend, we can win

[Outro]
I'm a believer, I'm a believer
I'm a believer, I'm a believer
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm a believer in you, girl

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat, give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined
I got that perfect beat, give me my—
Fat gold chains, Adidas with no strings
Gazelles with my gutter shades
If you love it, love it
Tell the DJ turn it up, I want it, want it
Just, give me my boombox

[Verse 1]
Remember them days when you had to be home before
The street lights came on?
You barely made it, ooh yeah
I came in a little late, the movie's watch breaking
Thinking I was Turbo tryna do the moon walk from a
Damn wall
Man, I was crazy, crazy
That's what made me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
It was the mind that made us heavy
It was the grind that kept it steady
But now things have changed, not the same
I'ma have to bring it back, we 'bout

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat, give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined

Gazelles with my gutter shades
If you love it, love it
Tell the DJ turn it up, I want it, want it
Just, give me my boombox
Boombox

[Verse 2]
I thought I was so fly rocking my Kangol hat to the side
Thought I was a b-boy (B-boy), yeah, yeah
I was in love with the Beemer, with the gold kid on the right
Nice in the rear view, huh, it was

[Pre-Chorus]
It was the mind that made us heavy (Heavy)
It was the grind that kept it steady (Steady)
But now things have changed, I had to upgrade
I'm about to bring it back

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat (Oh, oh, hey!), give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time (Yeah)
When people rocked mics and the b-boys shined (Uh-huh)

Gimme, gimme, gimme my boombox

Everybody who did it, haha, can I holla at you?
I just wanna say thank you for the opportunity of letting me learn this
I'm here, we bringing it back

[Chorus]
'Bout to bring the heat, give me my boombox
Bring it, bring it back to the time

[Verse 1]
I'm sweating gasoline
Will somebody just come and wipe me down?
If you struck a match on me
I'd probably burn this motherfucker down

[Refrain]
From the ceiling to the ground
What's that beat? No, what's that sound?
Got me blazing all around, all around
Like-like-like-like

[Pre-Chorus]
Danja, gimme something on the rocks
And I'm a take you straight up
Got me popping like a mighty morphing Power Ranger
Heat it up until the Fire Marshal come complaining
Don't come, come, complaining, it's hot

[Chorus]
It's hot in here but I don't wanna cool off (Hey, fire)
You keep this up, watch all my clothes come off (Hey, fire)
You burning things up, sexy flame thrower (Hey, fire)
Sexy flame thrower, got me burning up, inferno

[Post-Chorus]
You can burn it up, more fire
You can burn it up, uh-huh
You can burn it up, more fire
You can burn it up, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
Most of the chicks you meet
Aren't like me, they don't even count
So don't get me at, sprinklers on
Watch these bitches drown

[Refrain]
From the ceiling to the ground
What's that beat? No, what's that sound?
Got me blazing all around, all around
Like-like-like-like

[Pre-Chorus]
Danja, gimme something on the rocks
And I'm a take you straight up
Got me popping like a mighty morphing Power Ranger
Heat it up until the Fire Marshal come complaining

[Intro]
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Verse]
Yeah, my swagger's like uh in the DOMINO at that
Shawty sent a text, said she feelin' me, let me forward that
To my other girls, now she say she wanna meet her
A nigga goin' in like a quarter in a meter, so come on
I don't give a damn if she rollin', then I'm rollin'
I ain't talkin' 'bout a pill, but she pop it like she own it
Her continuous moanin', it carries to the mornin'
And Tisha like the steak, so I'm callin' it T-bonin'
My girl got a girlfriend, so you know what it is
I call them daycare 'cause they take care of my kids
Uh, bring the camera out, a motion picture
Before you take your clothes off, let me get the liquor
Nigga, I'm ill, oh, believe that
Her titties like snowballs, call 'em ski racks
They be like stop hoggin', ain't no I in team
I tell them, fuck you, nigga, it's in me
What it is? How you doin'? Nice to meet you
My flow is just like bullets, so this beat must be my nina
That chopper go blow, it split you from your feet up
I got your girl wet, floodin' like Katrina
Rather Billy or Bima, Fatima of Christina
Milian, I'm a don, I'm gettin' right between her
I'm strip club ballin', throwin' Franklins like Aretha
She say her mouth dry, so I'm guessin' it's the reefer
Whole team gorillas, K-Mac and Jewlz
Cali swag, nigga, I ain't talkin' dougie do
It's reject, nigga, 'cause we breakin' all the rules
Do my cat daddy, check on TMZ, it's breakin' news, uh
My car lot, jackpot
Got these girls cheerin' like a mascot
Boy, you ask that 'cause I'm hot
I'm mad, all you singles neck like a ascot
I'm on the top, hold your hair tip
When they hear that F.A.M.E. drop, they gon' shit a brick
No pun intended, but I recommend it
Fuck your feelings, nigga, I don't care if you offended

[Verse 1]
So what am I supposed to do?
When I’m doing things that ain't good for you
So what am I supposed to say?
When I try so hard but it feels the same
Said this growing love wont grow
If you don’t let me lead myself
Said this growing love won't show
Oh cause it's right now ain't good for my health, my health

[Hook]
'Cause you're selfish caught in the mood tonight
And you're always thinking 'bout you
And you're selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah baby it's my point of view, yeah, yeah

'Cause you're selfish caught in the mood tonight
And you're always thinking 'bout you
And you're selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah baby it's my point of view, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
See her days quickly gone
All her problems left it long, alone
Still I feel like nothing's changed
She wants to move it in the fast lane,
In the fast lane

[Hook]
'Cause you're selfish caught in the mood tonight
And you're always thinking 'bout you
And you're selfish conceited by your own right
Yeah baby it's my point of view, yeah, yeah

I'm the type of guy to supersize your life and turn it all around
Up and down, 'round and 'round, with me there's no backing down
So take some time to get to know me, I ain't acting phoney
Hop inside my ship and we can take off
And I just wanna keep your heart from getting colder
Whenever you get down, I say I'll be here like I told ya
Balenciaga shoes or Louis scarf up on your shoulder

To be treated like a princess, girl, you wear the crown
You can lay up on my headrest, while I take you down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, I'm on you like a tattoo

When you feelin' lonely
All you gotta do, baby, is phone me (Hello)
And I'll be right with you (What?), all I got is this picture (What?)

And when I'm not with ya (With you), my days are so cloudy
I be goin' through it tough when my baby not around me (Okay)
And you could call me selfish, you can't be nobody else's (Nah)
And I ain't lyin' when I tell you I ain't ever felt this (What?)
Way before, was good to know that she would ride or die for sure
I got plenty of bread so you ain't gotta worry 'bout the dough (Huh, stuntin')
And now you miss us, wow (Yeah)
G's on the luggage, now you travelin' in style (Haha, she like that)
Don't I make it look easy?
Lamborghini Moss with Lamborghini Breezy (Haha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Verse 1]
Daily, I've been waiting for the time
To pass and let it fade in
But baby, my patience is driving me crazy
Making me feel apart

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you do when the truth isn't quite enough?
They looking at you, telling you, "We need to break it up"
You need to trust what you do, it's you and me in love
But I'ma make it up to you and show the world

[Chorus]
I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean much to me
I don't wanna be done
I'm doing all that I can
And everybody hates Chris
They can never understand
So can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love? Can we love?
Can we love again?
Girl, I know I told you
Baby, this ain't over
This ain't over
It ain't over

[Verse 2]
I remember your touch, God, I miss you so much
Please believe me, baby, I'm sorry
And all of this money and fame can never amount
To every morning when I see your face

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you do when the truth isn't quite enough?
They looking at you, telling you, "We need to break it up" (Oh woah)
You need to trust what you do, it's you and me in love
But I'ma make it up to you and show the world

[Chorus]
I'm a changed man
'Cause you mean much to me (Oh woah)
I don't wanna be done (I don't wanna be done)

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
I'm such a leader, not a follower, I'm known to do my own thing
Fall off in the spot, Dirty D with the home ting
Rip the grip, don't say the wrong thing
MJ's swag too criminal, with the chrome thing
I'm on that grown man (Man), I'm never outta place (Outta place)
Ask about my swag (Swag), oh yeah, it's outer space (Outer space)
Y'all go buy the bar, Joc buy the whole place (Whole place)
You buy it buy the bottle, I'll pop the whole case (Uh)
Posted on the sofa (Yeah), blowin' fat splifs (Spliffs)
Linix small tags, I shop at Saks Fifth
Hard 'em up K, Christian Artikay
Your bitch keep watchin' me, she thinkin' what she ought to say (Ought to say)
I'll leave her speechless, had your girl shell shocked
I can tell she freaky and just don't know how to tell Joc
I got it leakin', Vicky Secrets on the flash flood
I just need some good lovin', I ain't lookin' for love

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pleasure P]
I ain't come up in this club, looking for love
I ain't come up in this club, l-l-l-looking for love

[Intro]
I'm your supplier

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I'm 'bout to order two bottles of Patron
I'm in the club with two models on my arm
I'm drama free, I left my problems at home
I know you mad but so what-at-at-at?

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Tonight I'm kissing you goodbye, you won't see me no more

I'm at the bar with a drink in my hand
Feel like a star 'cause I just came here to dance
I party hard, take two shots to the head
I put the bullets in the chamber

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Tonight I'm kissing you goodbye, you won't see me no more

Comin' live from the 804
In the party, in the party I go
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world
And it's a party everywhere I go
Your hands in the air
Two fingers up
Forget your problems
Let's turn it up
Dalé, mami, as go to you
Come and party with papi chulo
Got what you want and want you need
Throw them deuces up, two more bottles please

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson & Chris Brown]
Tell the waiter bring more bottles, I need more, more, more
But there's a big fat policeman at the door, door, door
And if he catch you by the collar, just throw him a few dollars
Tell the waitress bring the bottles, I need more, more, more (Shots!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new, new, new, deuces
I'm on some new, new, new, deuces

Say hello forever and goodbye tomorrow

Mama couldn't tell me shit, where was my daddy? (Mom)
Look at my Patek, I'm flexin', I'm petty (I'm petty)
I fucked the pussy the first time I met it
Won't give you no credit, you Eddie spaghetti

Married the money, the bitch wasn't ready, uh, uh

I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me

You need me to get that shit together

You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but

[Hook]
They came to doubt us with my mess, and you the fool

Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot
Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot

[Verse 1]
Anybody looking for the old me? Go down for my old shit
Coming at a nigga with a sneak diss, might as well put it out in the open
It ain't about the price tag, this why I never look at the price tag
Nothing going on and on, but I am killing this shit, but nigga, warp brain
All I hear is loud picks, all I see is satellites
I dont trust these hoes, no, not even in my afterlife
No love for the bloodsuckers tryina snatch a piece, they tryina grab a bite
Who wouldve guessed this type of life would generate this much of an appetite?
Life is a 8 count so Im always ahead about two steps
And to this day I still ain't seen a nigga coming close to what I do yet
Thats why she choosing up, she tooted up like a true vet
And she down for the crew, she giving that crew name

[Hook]
They came to doubt us with my mess, and you the fool
You tryina post a VIP my nigga, who was you
Valet my shit, I rock that shit, I rock that fucking spot
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot
Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot
Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot

[Verse 2]
These impostors deserve an Oscar
They know Im sick, flow is nauseous, I need a doctor
If she do it proper she on the rising
But I just ain't saving hoes, Im no Kevin Costner
You looking for me? You know where Im at
Im up at the suite, party of three
The ball 23 but one of the greatest arguably
You hear what I hear? The stocks went up so pardon the fee
Dont get it twisted, how can I change?
Im still the same nigga, just harder to reach
Im self-made and Im certified, flexed up like Im working out
I spit flames its Kirby time Im so fly I might burn alive
In her hair like curling iron, she grip that wood like turpentine
I asked her what that mouth do then she verbalized

[Hook]
They came to doubt us with my mess, and you the fool
You tryina post a VIP my nigga, who was you
Valet my shit, I rock that shit, I rock that fucking spot
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot
Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot
Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing, Im flexing
See these jewels, snatch your bitch up in the parking lot
Some people to get some brief diversion from the heaviness of politics and your day to day grind, and you just want a little fun, a little r-n-r. Others of you want to be politically challenged and uplifted and motivated to enact change in your communities...

But, yeah, and that you know, that's a perfect little space in this fucked up entertainment complex that we have constructed for ourselves, where we... Do you people realize that we have like an entertaining tyrant happening right now? Like Hilarious.

Where do you think entertainment comes from? Let's venture a guess...

So, when we're born--this is where we start, this is the fucking joke--our brains are too big to make it through the birth canal, so evolution makes us half-formed when we come out. And culture fills the gap. And we just do our best and hope that someone is going to tell us what is right or wrong and whatevernot. But, when you can find out a way to make one thing more attractive, one way of being more attreactive, that is when you get entertainment. Right?

I am not, I am deeply off script right now. To be honest I don't know.. what I saw, what I see happening right now... I don't know that I can rationally respond to this, like it's insane. It's truly insane. Are we just supposed to have a blues, like a chili-off right now? And just wait for someone hilarious to say something hilarious that makes us feel better about it for a second? Do we think that our hilarious tyrant is going to be met with a hilarious revolution? That is won by hilarious revolutionairies? And the whole thing is gonna be like entertaining as fuck the whole time.

I'm standing in front of a battleship, do you know what I mean, a literal battleship, in a country, that I can't even say it out loud. I always thought that it was going to look way more sophisticated than this when fucking evil happened. When the collective consciousness was so numb and so fucking sated and so gorged on entertainment... I expected a less cliche evil. And now it's just this bad... it's not even good writing. It's not even a good narrative.

How entertaining should this be right now? With a fucking battleship in the background and this shit happening on TV...how fucking fun should this be? How fucking fun can it be? Can it be real in any sense? with that shit... I can not play bored in the usa for you right now. No, no, no because guess what, I soft-shoed that shit into existence... by going: no no no look over here put your self awareness on it will never actually be that bad because we're too smart' and while we were looking in that direction... stupidity just fucking runs the world... because entertainment is stupid.

Do you guys realize that? Like, at the core, entertainment is stupid, you're welcome.

You may be bummed that homeless Chris Isaak is up here in a half unbottoned is stupid. But i gurantee you it is the only thing that may sticks out in this, fucking, fucking hickory smoked, this fucking abortion that culture is... maybe you're remember that. It's not particularly catchy...

Smoking on the blunt with your temporary bitch
One thing's for certain, two thangs for sho
I'm a Long Beach nigga everywhere that I go
If I do, if I don't, if I will, if I won't

[Hook]
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Puerto Rican diva, he call me his mamacita
He don't like to show emotions so it's hard to read him
I'm in the field, you in the bleachers, smokin' Cali reefer
I need the bag from Indonesia, watch him swipe his Visa
I just went and got the new one, tell that girl to keep up
All I gave him was a teaser, now your dude's a geeker
Mamacita so bonita, but I had to freeze her
It still ain't colder than my car, tell that girl to speed up

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Mamacita, never seen her 'less the green involved

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
You're a sneaky one, you thought I didn't know
Yeah I saw you creepin' on your tippy toes
She's conceited, she thinks everyone's beneath her
But oh no, no-no-no, no you got it all wrong
Who you been lyin' to?
You called us boys at the bar, you're a lyin' crew
You better hope you never see her, if you do, you better run
'Cause she's a street sweeper, she's a heartbreaker, she's a money-taker

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]

[Chorus]
What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
And what did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
(But you won't believe me)

[Verse 1]
I see death coming at me too quickly
I don't want this to end
I take an apple from the tree we planted together
I hold it in my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I said "change"
But please don't change
I know I said "do it"
But don't do it, don't do it

[Chorus]
What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
And what did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
(But you won't believe me)

[Verse 2]
I am scared of the child that lives in me
I don't know if he learns
You left your t-shirt under the bed we shared together
I put it over my face

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I said "change"
But please don't change
I know I said "do it"
But don't do it, don't do it

[Chorus]
What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
And what did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
(But you won't believe me)

[Outro]
(What does it)
(What does it)
(What does it)
(What does it)

[Verse 1]
Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
Found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

[Chorus]
Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

[Verse 2]
It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again

[Chorus]
How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

[Outro]
Oh again, and again
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
I wonder where they'll go, ah
Trouble's on the outside, I know

[Chorus]
But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Go!
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only
Thing left that's true

[Verse 1]
We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

[Pre-Chorus]
Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

[Chorus]
Just an alien

[Verse 2]
We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

[Chorus]
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

[Bridge]
Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime

[Chorus]
Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

[Verse 1]
We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

[Pre-Chorus]
Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

[Chorus]
Just an alien

[Verse 2]
We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

[Chorus]
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

[Bridge]
Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home

[Chorus]
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime
Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien

[Verse 1]
Bobby's just a friend of mine
He's on his back
I'm on his mind
He wakes me when he goes to work
His hands are cold
His breath is smoke

[Chorus]
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to

[Verse 2]
Do you forget when we first met?
You grabbed my hand
I tore your dress
I felt things I cannot express
But I lost my way
I made my mess

[Chorus]
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to

[Post-Chorus]
But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do, I do, I tell you what

[Verse 3]
I paint pictures of my heart
The color's blue and purple start
To bleed into an endless dark
It's only you, it's only you

[Chorus]
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to

[Post-Chorus]
But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do, I do, I tell you what
Dirty old pig
He lost his mind
He walked on the outside
He played dumb
He ate his pride
He walked on the outside

No matter what you do
The witch burns you

[Verse 1]
And every time you step outside the door
You wanted more
You're mad because you didn't get as high

And every time you step outside the gate
You get irate
You're mad because euphoria passed you by
Passed you by
Passed you by

[Chorus]
(Passed you by)
Ooh darlin' doll nobody can hold me back
(Passed you by)
Today may not be my day but tomorrow will never lack
(Passed you by)
Watch me as I ride this wave home darlin'
(Passed you by)
Feel me as I reach the mountain top

[Verse 2]
And now it's time for you to leave the stage
Jump in your cage
You're mad because you didn't get as high

And now it's time for you to find a path
Just do the math
You're mad because euphoria passed you by
Passed you by
Passed you by

[Chorus]
(Passed you by)
And here I am watching the hawks fly
(Passed you by)
Breathing the air feeling the sky
(Passed you by)
Cuz' there ain't no place I'd rather be
(Passed you by)
On top of the mountain feeling free!

(Passed you by)
(Passed you by)
(Passed you by)

[Verse 1]
Darlin'
You're my bubble of beauty and light
Darlin'
You're my lifeline of youth
In my sight

You're my daughter

[Chorus]
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel child
You're my angel
You're my angel child

[Bridge]
You're so wild and free
Just like the unspoken words
Spoken by the tree
Of life

[Verse 2]
You're my lifeline of youth
In my sight

You're my daughter

[Chorus]
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel child
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel child

[Verse 1]
Nobody likes you nobody cares
Nobody wants you nobody cares
To extend a greeting, a connecting glance
Life is just a jaded game to them
They won't give it a chance

But you know and I know
That the galaxies are all around us
And life will flow on
As long as the grass grows and the water runs

And while I'm here on earth
I'll rejoice in it's worth

[Chorus]
Cuz' Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
And you can't take that away from me

You got your guns up on display
But you can't control how I feel no way
Cuz' Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
And you can't take that away from nobody

[Verse 2]
Because the ocean is all around us
And life will flow on
As long as there are ripples in the waves
And sun rays from the sun

And while I'm here on earth
I'll rejoice in it's worth

[Chorus]
Cuz' Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
And you can't take that away from me

You got your guns up on display
But you can't control how I feel no way

Cuz' Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
And no amount of negativity can put a dent in me

Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free
Freedom is Free

[Verse 1]
Jealousy don't take my soul away from me
I understand you and you make me sick
Jealousy I'm green with envy
I'm turning into my worst enemy

[Chorus]
That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me

[Verse 2]
Jealousy you're insecurity
You make me feel like I'm hanging from a thread
From the top of this lover's game
I'm swimming in a pool of endless shame

[Chorus]
That's what you are to me
That's what you are to me

[Verse 3]
And then I met the hawk on the corner
The hawk said that everything's cool
And since the hawk is most righteous
To not believe her I'd be a fool
And then I met the wolf on the mountain
The wolf said everything's right
And since the wolf is most righteous
I'll always trust her insight

[Chorus]
That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me

[Verse 1]
This is me when I sit down
A new moon a new light
A new focal point of sight
Makes me feel all right

I'm not gonna lie
I need to reach the sky
But before I reach my high
My mind's eye has got to be free

And I walk, yes I breathe
And I pray, and I run, run, run

Yes I walk, and I breathe
Yes I pray, and I run, run, run

And I walk, yes I breathe
And I pray, and I run, run, run

Run, yes I'm on my way
I Run, yes I'm on my way
Now the time has come
To move my legs and run
I run I run I run I run
I need to run and run and run and run
And now I feel the energy of the universe
And I roll with it forever
I love you space and time
To put it simply I'm on my way

And now I'm elevating higher
My footsteps are finding a groove
All on their own

I'm communing with the fire
I'm free, my mind has shown

I've blazed its path
I've put aside my own wrath
I'm moving faster
My heart is stronger
The soul is brighter
I'm warm

I've blazed its path
I've put aside my own wrath
I'm finally at peace
I've blazed its path
I've put aside my own wrath
I'm moving faster
My heart is stronger
The soul is brighter
I'm warm

I've blazed its path
I've put aside my own wrath
I'm finally at peace
I'm finally at home

[Verse 1]
Can you name me a living creature
That kills all it's competitors for food?
And when they're gone he kills the
Competitors of its food's food too
I'm talking about the birds, the aphids
The insects, and the trees
Cuz' there's innumerable extinct species among these

We've been enacting a story for 12,000 years
The one that says that man must follow no natural law
The one that says that man is distinctly separate
From every living thing
That man is the end result of evolution
That man is the end result of evolution

Yes the clan of Cain killed the clan of Abel
So that Cain could bear the fruit of Abel's land
So man has been killing his brother from the
Beginning of the agricultural revolution

[Chorus]
Mass killings and mass graves, globalization of slaves
Genocide and extinction
All the functions of civilization

Mass killings and mass graves, globalization of slaves
Genocide and extinction
All the functions of civilization

[Verse 2]
Yes you know that the war will never be over
Cuz' war is our bread and butter
Cuz' we're living a lie that says there's no place for any other
Living creature that doesn't think like you and me
Yes now we're going to the root of the Taker Story:

We decide what's good and bad for the entire universe
And if what you do don't work for us we'll turn you into dust
You savages are wild so naked and so free
If you don't want to die you have to live like me

You Takers take and take and take and take and take
You Takers take and take and take and take and take

[Verse 3]
So even though you won't believe it native people are still around
They treat the earth with respect they know it's sacred ground
They live in remote places the takers still can't colonize
They are the true voice of reason they have nature's eyes
They've been enacting the story for 3 million years
The one that says that human must obey natural law
The one that says that human is connected to every living thing
That man is only one strand in the web of life

[Outro]
Take the dagger out your mind
Take the Taker out your soul
When you do you'll find
The Taker's lost control
The Taker's lost control
The Taker's lost control
The Taker's lost control
The Taker's lost control

The Takers take and take and take and take and take
The Takers take and take and take and take and take

[Verse 1]
Know you imagined too
You and me getting back too
You and me been past due
Nothing else matters, let's talk about it the morning after
Girl, they won't know if we take off
All your friends in the bathroom drunk
I just can't let you walk off
Still got some pieces to my heart

[Chorus]
So good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off
Back like we used to
This time I won't lose you
I still adore you
You always loyal
I'm gon' show you just how I feel
Before the song goes off

[Verse 2]
Who's making love to you?
Heard you was making oohs
Heard that he love you too
But that don't really matter, let's talk about it the morning after
You know I won't make you choose
But your friends talking to my crew
That leaves only me and you
Tell me what we have to lose

[Chorus]
So good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off
Back like we used to
This time I won't lose you
I still adore you
You always loyal
I'm gon' show you just how I feel
Before the song goes off
So good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off

[Interlude]
Hey baby, I just, I just don't know
It's like you complete me and I'm lost
The chances are I ran into you, like one in a billion

[Bridge]
Tell me, would you please
I know you still love me, yeah
Tell me, baby girl, tell me
I know you care for me

[Chorus]
It's so good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off
Back like we used to
This time I won't lose you
I still adore you
You always loyal
I'm gon' show you just how I feel
Before the song goes off

[Outro]
Who's making love to you?
Heard you was making oohs
But that don't really matter
Let's talk about it the morning after
I work my whole life for this
I mean I've seen so many road blocks
So many devils in my way
But to be honest with you I see nobody
I am the best!

He plays the sweetest melody
When I hear, it takes over me
And I feel every strum of his strings
It reminds me of all the things we used to be
Can't breathe at all 'cause you're coming...

[Chorus: Andre Merritt]
Coming through my speaker, speaker
Got me tryna reach ya, reach ya

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It kills me that I can't be with you
Thought I was the key you're playing
Don't know, I just gotta
Be the one you let bleed out
Wish I didn't know you, got me feeling stuck
I can't let you go, just my luck
Falling down without you, can you pick me up?
And now I can't get you off my head because you're coming...

Got me tryna reach ya, reach ya

[Verse 1]
I'm thinkin' of all the things I wanna do to you, girl, in the back seat
I'm thinkin' of all the shit that I could do to your body in a movie
Thinkin' of all the money I'm 'bout to spend
So what, so what, so what, the girl that I just left
So what, so what, so what
You close to panic tonight, imagination, baby
You close to panic tonight, infatuation, baby

So what, so what, so what
You close to panic tonight, imagination, baby
You close to panic tonight, infatuation, baby

Damn girl, damn girl
Do you got a man, girl?
You ain't got a man, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Her body was woo by the way that she walked in
Honey, looked just like a sin, I was memorized when she walked by
Now what I'm gon' do? 'Cause I gotta keep my cool
And I ain't that type of guy that steps to every girl that catches my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
Belly shirt, pierced navel and them heels
From your walk and your gestures, what's the deal?
So baby, come over here
What's your name? Girl, tell me everything you like
Lil' mama, don't have no fear, don't be scared
'Cause you know I ain't gonna bite

[Chorus]
Baby, it's okay if you wanna rock
Lil' mama, show me what you got
And I wanna say hey 'cause I'm feeling you
Baby, can you make your body move?
And I gotta say, oh lady
Girl, I wanna get to know ya when I run up on ya
Oh, baby, you got me fired up
And girl, I wanna say hey

[Verse 2]
On the phone, you can call me sometimes, we can get up, you and me
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do to make you mine
I'm gonna get it started, right on time, don't need no corny pick up lines
I'ma whisper in your ear and tell you everything that you wanna hear

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1: Andre Merritt]
Departure time, 7:30, I'm packed and ready to go
First class ticket outta here
I think it's time to put it back in gear
No more standing by, I'm tryna stay clear, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Turbulence got me nervous, I should have never flown
Scared when you fly alone again
You know the atmosphere wasn't perfect
I'm thinking to myself was it worth it?

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt & Chris Brown]
Layover's almost over, I can see clearly, no more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull on the lever, lever
This gon' be my final destination
No more sitting 'round having my time wasted
You say it's now or never, I pick never
We can be together, so calm down
No more red eye, late nights
I'm one way, no more connected flights, when

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
When we started out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code (Code), never thought that you would stoop so low (Low)
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah
My heart is sold (Sold), shoulda never, ever left me this cold
You got me flying solo
Solo, solo, solo (Solo), solo, solo, solo (Solo)
Solo, solo, solo (Solo)
You got me flying, you got me flying solo (Woo)
Solo, solo, solo, I'm solo, solo, solo (Oh, woah)

You got me flying, you got me flying solo

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Touching down, 11:30
I'm rushing through the doors, I'm in a good place now
I can't find my baggage and I don't even want it back
And I don't wanna have you no more
I don't need to carry on, it's gonna weight me down
You didn't think that I would find out
Whether or not, who is wrong or right
I can't talk now, I gotta catch another flight

[Pre-Chorus: Andre Merritt, Chris Brown & Both]
Layover's almost over, I can see clearly, no more stormy weather
Exit row, don't pull on the lever, lever
This gon' be my final destination ('Nation)
No more sitting 'round having my time wasted (Wasted)
You say it's now or never, I pick never
We can be together, so calm down
No more red eye, late nights
I'm one way, no more connected flights, when

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
When we started out, knew this relationship was unhealthy (Healthy)
You broke the code (Oh), never thought that you would stoop so low (Oh)
You got me flying solo

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Thought I was scared to fly without you here
Now you can't get under my skin like you did before, why
I was so reluctant to walk out on us
So now I'm taking back my life, goodbye, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
When we started out, knew this relationship was unhealthy
You broke the code, never thought that you would stoop so low
You got me flying solo
Now you crying, talking 'bout you can't live without me, yeah

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Bang, bang
Look, man, why's it every time we try to get into the club
The bouncer acts like he don't know who you are?
Shut up, man

You know what I think? Do you know who I am?
Or do I have to say this three more times?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Fuck you, I'm famous

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Strobe light in the club like a movie, slow-mo
When we leave the party, pile 'em in the four-door
I got a turbulence, she shout out my nigga Loso
I'm buyin' 100 bottles, that's if you want more
So wave your hands up in the air
If you're shinin' like a chandelier
The only thing I see is money up in here
I'ma get this girl a bottle, she gon' make it disappear
Champagne's in the bottles with the models
And I got 'em all screamin' like they won the lotto
If you don't want this P, tell 'em try Moscato
'Cause my doors goin' up on my Murcielago

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you, I'm famous
Fuck you

[Verse]
I'm a fresh kid, check my style meter
Fresh to death kid, call me soul eater
I make 'em drop it low, they do my dance all on the floor
Into the floor, cave in then I'm out of the door
I must be outta my head like my brains scrambled like eggs
Get the cameras off me, nigga, hop up off me, nigga, hop up off my dick
My style is super sick and there are no competitors
And they can't see 'cause they the prey and I'm the predator
I, I rock, I'm the shit, you turds
Check my iPod, I'm such a fuckin' nerd
I'm flyin' higher than the fire on these sirens
When the plane is slowly divin', I guess I'm blowin' sky high then

[Pre-Chorus]
Pause, lemme see that ass on the floor
If I give it you, I know you gon' want more (Hit it)

What the fuck ya talkin'? Got my chandelier
Air hold me down 'cause I'm dimin' here like
Clap for me, bitch
Clap for me, bitch
The bad, white men call him the devil
The Yavapai call him "Eyes Like the Sky"

This story takes place in the hinterlands of the newly formed United States
And territories in the years before and after the great conflagration called the Civil War
Men roam and fight each other to simply stay breathing
Muskets give way to repeating rifles, cannons give way to Gatling guns
War nurtures weapons, but weapons clear the land

In the deserts of the southwest, old hatreds grow into new ones
Old beliefs are shattered by gunfire and charging horses
Into this cauldron of fire rides a young man who becomes a shadowed legend
His name even takes on the mantle of the bogeyman in some homes
Among the first Americans, his name is exalted from wickiups to longhouses
From teepees to cliff dwellings
Among the men of the badlands, he's feared for his silent walk
And swift, economical dispatching of his enemies
Chapter 1:

They'd been watching the farmhouse for a while, maybe all day
There were two of them, both young and fit and desert-hardened
They were lords of where they lived and they had no farm teachings from white men or Mexicans
Except for one thing
They hated the Mexicans more than the white men because of their cruelty
They had learned cruelty from the Mexicans very well in return

The smoke from the mud-house curled up into the sky like an albino snake
The two young men watched and counted the white men down in the farmyard
A tall man and two shorter ones, maybe his sons
A woman would occasionally come out from the shack
Get water from the well in the front yard and carry it back inside
A small child would be with her
The men watching on the rim had no calendars so they didn't know the date
12th of June, year of our Lord, 1854

But one thing they did know: about an hour away were the rest of their party
Eight men, all armed, running smoothly and trackless over the rocks
One of the watchers moved away to tell the main party of what they had seen
The raid was about to start

[Intro]
Ya' know the fuck goin' on nigga(Big Soulja)
Big Soulja(Big Soulja the mixtape, Big Soulja the movie)

(DJ Jerry nigga, he's goin' hard man, you'd hear me out bitch)

[Verse 1]
They call me Big Soulja
I'm trappin' and cappin' that white
Mixing the lean with the sprite
Covered in ice, whippin' the dope all night
Ridin' 'round, and you know that I'm trappin'
Spent cash for the X6 and the Aston
Patek stand on my wrist
Perfectly dabbin'
Maison Margiella, how I fashion

[Interlude]
Big Soulja, bitch rich before the deal
17, made my first M
Broke my wrist when I jumped out the gym
Swimmin' pool at the crib but I can't swim
18 had to get an M
With a pyrex and a pot, I can whip a 10
Fuck around and run another dividend
Havin' my way with the shit, nigga rich

[Verse 2]
Jumped out the trap then I whippin' the beat
I got i8, automatic and the stick shit
Lamborghini with a new key
Bust down, my wrist, teach you how to hit a lick
Got rich or die trying on my 50 cent shit
Disrespect, Big Soulja get the stick
On the shooter, he know he ain't gon' pop shit
I got the F'n'N with the 30 clip

[Hook]
Big Soulja
Trappin' blocks, Whippin' pots
Yeah, you know I'm gettin' guap in the spot
Big Soulja
10 chains, 10 whips, 10 bitches
10 bricks, in the kitchen flippin' shit
Big Sauce, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja

[Interlude]
Yeah man, view on your motherfuckin' trap
You know, you know what I'm sayin'
Your car, your crib, where you at man
Turn the song, turn this shit all the way the fuck up
This that sauce nigga, Big Soulja nigga
Niggas scared of me man, I ain't even gonna lie

[Verse 3]
I came up trappin' bands
Made an M when I came home from jail
They had me locked down in the cell
That's the only reason I don't fuck with 12s
Draco drive-by, and then I throw a chief
He sneak dissin', got popped like a pill
Sneak dissin' draco, but he can't pay the bills
I come through, hit the nigga with the steel
Standing in the trap, having ice in my clip
Young nigga hit the lotto
Young nigga smokin' on gelato
I don't have any bricks, buyed the Cando'
That's the lean in that baby bottle

[Hook]
Big Soulja
Trappin' blocks, Whippin' pots
Yeah, you know I'm gettin' guap in the spot
Big Soulja
10 chains, 10 whips, 10 bitches
10 bricks, in the kitchen flippin' shit
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja
Big Soulja, they call me Big Soulja

[Verse 1]
I hope you know just how I feel, girl, I ain't running game
But there's a couple things I'd like to try to explain

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you wanna wait a while
Girl, I ain't mad at you, in fact I like your style
'Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling
It's real, ooh and baby, here's the deal

[Chorus]
I'll be right here
'Til the sun and the moon and the stars, they all refuse to shine
I'll be right here
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
I'll be right here
Girl, I wanna be a part of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me

[Verse 2]
You don't have to be afraid to say what's on your mind
Your body language's telling me, let's take our time

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you wanna wait a while
Girl, I ain't mad at you, in fact I like your style
'Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling
It's real, oh and baby, here's the deal

[Chorus]
I'll be right here
'Til the sun and the moon and the stars, they all refuse to shine
I'll be right here
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
I'll be right here
Girl, I wanna be a part of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me, yeah

[Bridge]
Don't you doubt our love, don't you doubt our love
You're the only one, you're the only one I'm thinking of
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, oh no
Oh, no no no no
Ain't going nowhere
Baby, I'll be right here
Uh huh
Ain't going nowhere
Baby

[Chorus]
I'll be right here
'Til the sun and the moon and the stars, they all refuse to shine
I'll be right here
I wanna be the thoughts that you think, whatever is on your mind
I'll be right here
Girl, I wanna be a part of you, just like the air you breathe
And you can count on me, baby
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
I'll be right here
I'll be right here
I'll be right here

[Verse 1]
It's kinda crazy I feel this way, baby, I'm saying
What kinda man have I come to now to be out there playing?
But babe, I got a lot to say, why won't you listen?
'Cause I've been a fool, going crazy without you with me
It's kinda crazy I feel this way, baby, I'm saying
What kinda man have I come to now to be out there playing?
But babe, I got a lot to say, why won't you listen?
'Cause I've been a fool, going crazy without you with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, oh why, oh why, oh why? I been stupid lately
Girl, I apologize, I owe you, baby
Please don't bury me alive 'cause it's killing me inside
And I can't lie, girl, I...

[Chorus]
I'm afraid that you're cheating, must have been my love
Been neglecting your trust as if it was enough, I messed up
I'm afraid that you're giving up, I did too much, my love
Right now it's all about us, all about all, about us, my love

[Verse 2]
It's kinda crazy about my babe, she was never complaining
She was never fed up with me but I kept on changing
One time had the nerve to say that she was laming
She couldn't compare, them other girls wouldn't care to deal with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, oh why, oh why, oh why? I been stupid lately
Girl, I apologize, I owe you, baby
Please don't bury me alive 'cause it's killing me inside
And I can't lie, I'm afraid

[Chorus]
I'm afraid (Yeah) that you're cheating (You're cheating), must have been my love
Been neglecting your trust as if it was enough, I messed up (I messed up)
I'm afraid that you're giving up, I did too much, my love (Oh, oh, oh)
Right now it's all about us (Oh, oh, oh), all about all, about us, my love
Taylor's Letter
This album is called "Fearless", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, "Fearless" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say "you're NOT sorry", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless

New Kung Fu Kenny!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
He'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!," X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—

[Break: Kendrick Lamar]
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

[Chorus: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar—

Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Voicemail: Carl Duckworth]
What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart"
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

[Bridge 1: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & Kendrick Lamar]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom

You know I'm fresh when I walk in the mall

When I hit the band, turn up on ya

When I get bands, turn up on ya
When I hit the band, I turn up on ya
You know I'm so fresh when I walk in the mall

The girl I loved

[A$AP Rocky]
You know, growin' up... I had this beat stuck in my head
Just no matter what I could never get it out
I guess when you're young, you can be anything you wanna choose

[A$AP Rocky in the scene with a kid asking for an autograph]
Hey kid you want an autograph?
Cool? Gimme down!

[A$AP Rocky]
But as you get older all of those options start to narrow
And before you know it every choice you made comes with a consequence
And whenever shit got rough... this beat was always there
But one day man... it just stopped
My brother moved on but...
Beat came back, passing through every vein in my body
You know, my older brother Ricky
Is responsible for me growin' up and having a real job

[Ricky]
Com'on Rocky! Just go for it! Just rap!

[Crowd]
A$AP, A$AP, A$AP...!!!

[Verse 1]
She looked up from the book she was reading
With the prettiest smile that I ever saw
Curly hair down her back
And her skin like cinnamon brown without a flaw
And man, those eyes
Made my heart stop in my chest
Then she said, "Hi"
And it was hard to catch my breath
I said, "Hey lil' mama
I don't mean to bother at all, my name is Chris" (Hello, hello)
And before she could answer
I said, "Don't say a word
Listen to this, I think you're fine"
And she cracked that smile again
Let's say goodbye to my homies and your friends

[Chorus]
We can dip out...
We can dip out alone, keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving
Talk about life, about love, that's what's up (Oh, yeah)
Keep it moving (Oh)
Don't matter at all (All)
Wherever we go (Go)
Oh (No)
Girl, just come on, let's keep it moving

[Verse 2]
So we exchange numbers
I told her I'll be at her crib by a quarter to six
We can go get a bite, little lady
Or chill at the mall and catch a flick
If that's alright
She said, "As long I'm home by nine (Nine)
Whatever we do is fine"
I can't believe
I can't believe that she's here with me, no (Hey)
And God only knows
God only knows, how far we can go
I hope this night will go my way
I hope this night will go my way and we can do this everyday
And if I'm cool and take my time
Then I might just get a kiss goodnight, oh yeah

[Chorus]
We can dip out alone, and keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving (ha)
Talk about life, about love, that's what's up (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And keep it moving (Oh)
It don't matter at all (All)
Wherever we go (Go)
Oh no (No)
Girl, just come on, let's keep it moving

[Zack de la Rocha]
It seems as if soon
As the wall in Germany fell
That the US government was busy building another one
At the border beween the US and Mexico
Since 1986, as a result of a lot of the hate talk and hysteria
That the government of the United States has been speaking
1,500 bodies have been found at the border
We wrote this song in response to it
It's called "Without a Face"

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got no card, so I got not soul
Life is prison, no parole, no control
Jura got my number on a wire tap
'Cause I jack for Similac, fuck a Cadillac
Survive, one motive no hope
'Cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope
Yes, I know my deadline, sire, when my life expires
I'm sendin' paper south under the barbed wire
The mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave
It's my life for their life, so call it a free trade
"Por vida" and our name up on the stall
I took a death trip, when I tried to cross the white wall

[Chorus]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face
Born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves an the gates
Born without a face
One motive no hope, uh, yeah
Born without a face
Without a face!

[Verse 2]
I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, he couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize, was all we needed to sustain
Golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down with DDT, yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin', path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, one motive no hope, uh
It's hard to breathe with Wilson's hand around my throat, uh
Strangled and mangled, another SS curtain call
When I tried to cross the white wall
When I tried to cross the white wall

[Chorus]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face!
One motive no hope, uh
Without a face!
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates
Born without a face!
One motive no hope, uh
Without a face!

Talkin' about the American Indian movement
Well in 1977, after a series of long struggles against the BIA
Get that spotlight out of my fuckin' eye, man
Get that thing off
Talkin' to people I can't even see 'em
In 1977, after a long series of struggles
The Oglala Sioux reservation was under attack by the FBI
People who were involved in the movement there
Involved in defending their culture, defending their freedom
Were bein' taken away, were bein' kidnapped
Were bein' murdered and one man
Who happened to be one of the leaders of AIM
Was thrown in jail
He has sat there for 17 years for crimes he did not commit
His name is Leonard Peltier, and this brother's been in jail
And has served his people, and has served true freedom
And constitutional rights and is being denied his own
And I think it's a hypocrisy all of us need to expose in this country
So that if we wanna raise our voice
For ourselves in America the same doesn't happen
We've got, we've got some pamphlets in the back
Where we're sellin' some shirts
Please pick one up, and please send, please, send
Your name or there's an address you can send or what's his name
Fuckin' Dixey Crack Clinton, whoever that fuckin' punk is
Let's fill this punk's room full of fuckin' mail
I know it's not the fuckin' most powerful form of fuckin' change But let's get this fuckin' ball rollin' all right
This song is called "Bombtrack"
One time for ya fuckin' mind, Minnesota
Check this shit out
Yeah, it goes a-1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just another bombtrack and suckers be thinkin' that they can fade this
But, I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold run a train on punk ho's, that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge, and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall, and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views, that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, and then watch 'em burn

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

[Verse 2]
It goes a
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

[Pre-Chorus]
With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after mothafuckin hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

[Verse 1]
I got my keyboard, symbols all ready
Pull up the strings and leave the bottom all heavy
Palms all sweaty, this feels like a dream
Little excited, you know what I mean, girl
Girl, I'm in need for a woman that can play (Play)
Knows how to turn it up loud any time of the day
Take my CD and baby, press repeat
It ain't no need to speak, just let it play (Play)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got my attention now
I can't let you down, your lyrics and your sound
Imagine me and you, what we gon' do (Do)
Just listen but wait before the breakdown

[Chorus]
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend
Love music, love music
Nobody has to know
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Can't wait to get this party started (Started)
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it
Sit back and listen to some love music

[Verse 2]
Turn my mic up, can we  loop it now?
I'm the rhythm of the track and it ain't gon' change
The tempo stays the same
Let it flow through the music now (Damn)
And I just want to see you smile
Now forget about what it is, yeah
So baby, take my CD and baby, press repeat
It ain't no need to speak, just let it play

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got my attention now (Got my attention now)
I can't let you down, your lyrics and your sound (Woah, woah, yeah)
Imagine me and you, what we gon' do
Just listen but wait before the breakdown

[Chorus]
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend
Love music, love music
Nobody has to know
Let's listen to some love music, love music
Can't wait to get this party started (Started)
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it
Sit back and listen to some love music

[Bridge]
No matter what the record is
Anytime it plays, girl, my heart skips a beat
I feel it in my soul, I'm about to overload
It's taking control of me
We're the perfect harmony, baby
Let's just keep the speakers blasting
And I won't stop (I won't stop)
'Til we burn out together

[Chorus]
Let's listen to some love music (Hey), love music
Lay back and just let it spin, this music is your friend (Ooh, yeah)
Love music, love music (Music, music)
Nobody has to know (Yeah)
Let's listen to some love music, love music (Woah)
Can't wait to get this party started (I just wanna be your heart)
I'll hit the switches, let me remix it (Ooh)
Sit back and listen to some love music

[Outro]
Love, love music
Love, love, love music, love music, love music
Love, love music
Love, love, love music, love music, love music

[Verse 1]
Woah, what are you thinking?
I know you see your cell phone blinking
Backwards and forwards I'm pacing
Tryna figure out why you ain't calling me back
What does it all mean?
Maybe tryna show me something
But you ain't gotta do it this way, no
Put yourself in my shoes, tell me, what would you do

[Chorus]
She knows I been hitting her on the phone
And I know she been getting it, something's wrong
Could it be that she's with the other dude
From her past? I know damn well that she ain't
Sitting and laughing with her girlfriends
Looking at the number, talking 'bout it's him again (Oh)
I know she better call pretty soon or I'ma have (Woah)
To send the boys to find out just why she's been M.I.A

[Verse 2]
Is there a problem?
And if it's really one, I'ma solve it
Don't know how you handled other dudes but I'm not them
Girl, you running 'round
Got 'em thinking that I can't handle my thing
Ooh, are you crazy?
Did you really think you could play me?
I'm 'bout to show up on your doorstep
And you better answer when I, knock, knock
You better be by yourself

[Chorus]
She knows I been hitting her on the phone (Oh)
And I know she been getting it, something's wrong (And I know she been getting it, yeah)
Could it be that she's with the other dude
From her past? (Oh) I know damn well that she ain't (I know she ain't with him)
Sitting and laughing with her girlfriends (Laughing)
Looking at the number, talking 'bout it's him again (Talking about me, oh)
I know she better call pretty soon or I'ma have (Yeah, woah)
To send the boys to find out just why she's been M.I.A. (M.I.A.)

[Bridge:]
You can't run 'cause the boys are find ya, girl
You can't hide 'cause you know I'm right behind ya, girl
If you telling the truth
Then why you acting like you're scared over there?
You can't run 'cause the boys are find you, oh
You can't hide 'cause you know I'm right behind you, oh
If what you say is true
Then why you can't call me back, baby, baby? Yeah

[Chorus]
She knows I been hitting her on the phone
And I know she been getting it, something's wrong
Could it be that she's with the other dude
From her past? I know damn well that she ain't
Sitting and laughing with her girlfriends
Looking at the number, talking 'bout it's him again (Oh)
I know she better call pretty soon or I'ma have (Woah)
To send the boys to find out just why she's been M.I.A

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Laying here, all out of ideas
Ain't picked up the phone in so damn long
I got the lights off and I ain't sleep in 'bout a week
You got a man in defeat and that's the picture of me
The last time we spoke, I said goodbye
You had this look on your face, so many tears in your eyes
And I tried to say it was for the best
But now I regret my choice

[Pre-Chorus: Johnta Austin]
And if I had it to do all over
I would find me another way
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another
But I'm too proud to ask you back
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
Baby, sorry, the things I said and the things I did
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you

[Verse 2: Johnta Austin]
Yeah, you had heart enough to handle me
But I kept my heart out of reach
Feeling strong enough to carry us
Still I violated every trust
Is it too late, I wonder, to say I'm sorry?
Too late, I wonder, to beg your pardon?
All I think about is how I messed it up
And all I think about is how I need your love

[Pre-Chorus: Johnta Austin]
And if I had it to do all over
I would find me another way
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another
But I'm too proud to ask you back
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
Baby, sorry, the things I said and the things I did
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
And If I can see you
I'll tell you that I'm sorry
I'll tell you that it's my fault
And I don't wanna be alone
And if I can hold you
I'll love you like I never did before
And then I would love you more
Never, ever let you go

[Pre-Chorus: Johnta Austin, Chris Brown & Both]
I swear that if I had it to do all over (Had it to do)
I would find me another way (Find another way)
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another (Too hurt to love)
But I'm too proud to ask you back (Too proud to ask you back)
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I (I needed to tell you)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Johnta Austin & Both]
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you (Oh, oh, oh)
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
And if I could see you again, I'd say, baby
Baby, I'm sorry, sorry, for the things I said and the things I did (Oh, oh, oh)
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
All of my girls in here just like this
Hating ass chicks, they don't want none
Most of them probably wanna be like me
I'ma show them what I'm made of

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Andre Merritt]
I know you want a nasty girl
You like a fly and flashy girl

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Pussycat, Pussycat, all the Dolls on the floor
I can holla at the boy any time I wanna go
Any time you want some more, I can give him three or four
And my body's sweating, dripping and dancing up on the pole (Yeah)
This is the freak show, ready to lock and load
Heavy drinking, papi tripping on me now he gone
Thinking that I won't, hit him, quit him and go
I'm a nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl
You can't even front on me, I'm too naughty
I got just what you need, I can be your shawty
You play it right and do things I like

Y'all fi need a chick that really do you right

Hold 'em there quit, I don't buzz 'em, I don't drive

You want a nasty girl to love you all night (All night)
C'mon selector, make me feel right (Make you feel right)

He wants me to give it up (He wants me to give it up)
And I ain't gonna front (I ain't gonna front)
I'm a nasty girl but I'm a classy girl

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm in the Volvo with the whole roof gone
Everybody know how the boy done blown
Up in the stratosphere, outta here, I'm gone
By the way, I hit that, flip that, do my dance
And then I hear 'em moan
I ain't come with no security, I can do it on my own
Say what's new Pussycat? Woah

You gon' have to throw it back, woah

[Intro: Jessica Mauboy & Chris Brown]
Ooh
Oh, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 1: Jessica Mauboy]
Baby, would you tell me if you made a mistake?
Would you keep it real, tell it to my face?
Or would you lie and try to cover it up?
Knowing if I found out, I'll leave you in the dust?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now baby, what would you do if I got in trouble and went away?
Would you stay true?
Would you stick around or do another dude?
I'm curious to know, I need your love, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Jessica Mauboy & Chris Brown]
Our love is deep like a river, better than an ocean
Boy, you can't even imagine
If I'm getting what I wanted, what I need
I'll never
Girl, you shouldn't say never
I'm saying that I'll never leave

[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy & Chris Brown]
I'll never leave you, boy
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply?
I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever
But you got me wanting to say
I'll never

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Girl, if I went from a Benz to a hoopty, making minimum wage
And I couldn't buy you Louis
I couldn't get ya nice thangs
Would you be a no show if I had no clothes?

[Verse 5: Jessica Mauboy & Chris Brown]
First of all, I got my own things
Well baby, things can be replaced
But I can't get enough of you, no, you can't, girl
In other words, I'm telling you that I'll never leave

[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy & Chris Brown]
I'll never leave you, boy
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply?
I'll never leave, I'll never leave (No, no, no, no, no)
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever
But you got me wanting to say (Yeah, to say)
I'll never

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Jessica Mauboy & Both]
Forever is a long time (Woah, oh)
For you to be giving me
I'll give everything like this, baby
But if you'll be rolling with it, I'ma roll with it, girl
Forever is a long time (Yeah, yeah)
For you to be giving me your words
Saying you won't ever hurt me
So if we're rolling then let's roll then, let's go

[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy & Chris Brown]
I'll never leave you, boy (I'll never leave, I'll never leave, no, no)
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride
You got your answer, what's your reply? (You got your answer, now what's your reply?)
I'll never leave, I'll never leave
I'll never leave you, girl (No, no, never)
I never say never or always and forever (Oh)
But you got me wanting to say
I'll never
I'll never leave you, boy (Show me what you say is really real)
'Cause once I'm done, I'm done, I ride (I can't take it, I can't take it)
You got your answer, what's your reply? (If you ever left me)
I'll never leave, I'll never leave (I won't leave)
I'll never leave you, girl
I never say never or always and forever (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
But you got me wanting to say
I'll never

[Outro: Chris Brown & Jessica Mauboy]
I'll never
I'll never

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yessir, ow
Two up, two down, uh-huh
Haha, yessir
What this means
Uh-huh
Oh, uh-huh
Feel this, let's go

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I picked up the paper and the headline reads (What it say?)
It says, "Single broken heart in some satin sheets"
And I'm like why? We had a hell of a time (Wassup, baby?)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first met you (Yeah), I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something (Oh) falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped, oh, it's your heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but seen it's alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's just something that can happen when you put it down (Oh!)
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right (Oh! Oh! Oh! Let's get it)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You see the mama called me to release steam
She said, "My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep
She just cries 'cause you're in her mind" (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something (Yeah, yeah) falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped (Oh), oh, it's your heart (Yeah, damn)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty is caught up (Oh!) from a long night
She's ready to fall but (She's) seen it's alright
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right (Break it down)

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Get down to the floor, go shawty
Feel the beat, get down to the floor, hell yeah
Feel the beat, get down to the floor, go shawty
Feel the beat, get down to the floor, hell yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
If you just keep it in stride you should be all right
And if you take what's inside (Inside) and mix that with pride
Instead, running along, keeping it going when you call
Girl, tell me why

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped (You dropped), oh, it's your heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but seen it's alright (Ayy)
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but seen it's alright (Oh)
That's just something that can happen when you put it down (Yeah)
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right
Shawty is—

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Blow it out, ah
Is it good?
Let's go
Blow it out, ah
Is it good?

[Intro]
Yeah, young, young, young Chris
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yo, yo
Yo, drop the beat about right about
Yeah, right there, right there
Uh-huh, huh, ooh
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Come on, check it

[Verse 1]
Why you calling me a player?
Why you call me little shorty-mac?
You should be calling me your Romeo
'Cause I'm looking for my Juliet
You say I want my cake and eat it too
I'm digging every chick up in this school
From time and time again, I tell you
I got nothing but love for you

[Chorus]
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love

[Verse 2]
I can't help that half of these chicks in school be digging me
It's just who I am, girl you need to know (Oh girl, you should know)
But I can tell that I want you here right next to me
Though you be raising hell, time and time again, I say

[Chorus]
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Nothing but love)
Got nothing but love for you, baby (Nothing but love)
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying (Better believe me)
Got nothing but love for you, baby (Uh-huh, yeah)
Nothing but love, nothing but love

[Bridge]
Wait, wait, hold up
Pause, just for minute, 'cause I need a minute
To let you know what's really real
Yeah, yeah, huh, you know it
Hold up, I need second, baby, wait, I gotta finish
You think you know what I feel, time and time again, I say

[Chorus]
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Oh yeah)
Got nothing but love for you, baby (Baby)
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Oh yeah)
Just believe these words that I'm saying (Oh, oh)
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Cross my heart, girl, I wouldn't lead you on
Nothing but love, nothing but love
I got nothing but love for you, baby
Just believe these words that I'm saying
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Nothing but love, nothing but love

[Verse 1]
What's up with this? Used to kick it on the regular
But since the deal, you say my life has changed
I remember when we used to argue and it make no sense
Afterwards we'd make love again

[Pre-Chorus]
That was way before the videos
Way before the number 1 singles
On the radio, late night at the studio
When I was just CB, nobody knew me
But you were still the same now

[Chorus]
Being without you is like having nothing
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus in my bank account
But it's nothing without you, nothing without you
I ain't been the same since you came in my life
And you're the only one to help me get right
And the way I'm feeling, girl, you need to know
Without you life is back to zero

[Verse 2]
Baby, just listen, girl, it's just a job so don't look at me different
Looking in your heart, girl, I know you're committed
And what I told you stands true
I've been down for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
That was way before the videos
Way before the number 1 singles
On the radio, late night at the studio
When I was just CB, nobody knew me
Girl, you were still the same

[Chorus]
Being without you is like having nothing (Oh, yeah)
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus in my bank account
But it's nothing without you (Nothing), nothing without you (Nothing)
I ain't been the same since you came in my life (I ain't been the same)
And you're the only one to help me get right (Oh, oh, oh)
And the way I'm feeling, girl (Feeling, girl), you need to know
Without you life is back to zero

[Intro]
One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Refrain]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him

[Verse]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name!

[Chorus]
Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
Death is on my side!
Suicide!

[Verse]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name!

[Chorus]
Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
Caught between my culture and the system
Genocide!
Read my writing on the wall!
No one's here to catch me when I fall!
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face!
Yeah!

[Outro]
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
Settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later
If we don't take action now
Now, now
Now, now
Now, now
Now, now
Now, now
Now, now
Now, now

If you're feeling real sad, just look on your wall
I'm your pin-up princess, yeah, you know who to call

I've got a million dollar smile, I can live in your dreams
With my angel wings and Fiorucci jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus 1: Charli XCX]
Close your eyes and lay back (Mhm)
Think about us, we could burn up the second we touch
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Verse 2: Uffie]
Gloss on my lips, pop, sun in my eyes
Go steal the liquor from inside
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you
Open the top, pop, drink in my glass
Here come the cop, cops, better drink fast
Wanna take a little sip with you
Wanna spend a little bit with you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charli XCX]
Just close your eyes and lay back (Mhm)
Think about us, we could burn up the second we fuck

Dealer, dealer, dealer
Eh-eh-XCX

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
And baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Calling out for your love
Baby, I’m calling out, I can’t do without you
Put ecstasy on my tongue and that’s all I’m tasting now
You’re luxurious, I’m stuck
Champagne, cigarettes, convertibles
It’s ‘bout to pop off
Bitin' on a rose, you make me cum
I’m way up, rooftop
You hurt me when you stop
I just can’t get enough, dealer

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you got it
You know I want it
You're selling all the drugs that I like
Baby, you the love of my life
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

[Verse 2: ABRA & Charli XCX]
I was never great at dealing with no comedown
So feel free to come 'round when you wanna come 'round
You’re my favourite drug, just take me to your underworld
And put me on your tongue, hallucinate until your toes curl
Tsu-tsunami, you can’t stop me now, I’m peaking too
Off the kiki and hypnotic, I’m not through with you
When you cum, it feels like diamonds raining down on me
When I’m with you, heaven on Earth is not a fantasy
Roll the windows down, my wrists awry, you got me so cold
Bitin' on a flower, blood like water down from my nose
It hurts, but I can’t stop
I just can’t get enough
(I can’t get enough)

[Chorus: Charli XCX & ABRA]
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like
(Selling all the drugs that I like)
Baby, you got it
You know I want it (Yeah)
And baby, you the love of my life
(The love of my life)
Selling all the drugs that I like
(Selling all the drugs that I like)
Baby, you got it
You know I want it

[Interlude: Charli XCX]
Dealer, dealer, dealer, ooh
Dealer, dealer, dealer
Baby, you the love of my life
Selling all the drugs that I like, yeah

Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like
Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like
Love of my life, love of my life
Love, love, love, love
Drugs that I like

Eh-eh-XCX

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Came here tonight, knew I would see you
But I wasn't quite ready for it, no
These feelings I can't ignore 'cause
The two us are over but I'm not sure if I'm over you
Baby, I made a mistake when I upped and walked away

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(One more chance)
Now I wish I had one
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl
And I wish I had one (One more chance)
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
One more night to talk late on the phone and more
One more smiling face like that ones you used to put on the bottom of your notes
Oh, one more touch, one more hug, ooh
Don't even talk about a kiss
I can't help but reminisce

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(One more chance)
'Cause I wish I had one
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl
And I wish I had one (One more chance)
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one, yeah
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl
And I wish I had one (One more chance)
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya (Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Too bad, love is over 'cause I wish I had one

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Baby, oh, baby, I know I stated we needed some time apart
But seeing you has got me on a mission, I'm just wishing
Maybe, just maybe you'll realize it and let me back in your heart (Oh yeah)
I'm at your mercy, ooh girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I wish I had one
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better
'Cause now I see that you are the girl
Now I wish I had one (One more chance)
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Said it's too bad love is over, I wish I had one
One more chance to tell you, baby, I know better (Oh)
'Cause now I see that you are the girl
(One more chance)
One more chance to show ya how much I still love ya
Too bad, love is over

Pt. 1 Love Drought

[Intro: Lemonade Speech]
Do you remember being born?
Are you thankful for the hips that cracked, the deep velvet of your mother
And her mother and her mother?

You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.
You desperately want to look like her.
How to wear your mother's lipstick
You must wear it like she wears disappointment on her face.

Your mother is a woman,
And women like her can not be contained.

I think of lovers as trees
Growing to and from one another,
Searching for the same light.
Why are you afraid of love?
I think it's not possible for someone like you.
But you are the love of my life (the love of my life)

[Verse]
Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

[Chorus]
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now (make it rain now)
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Pt. 2 Sandcastles

[Intro: Lemonade Speech]
If we're gonna heal
We gonna start again,
You are the magician pulling me back together again,
The way you cut me in half.
Make the woman in doubt disappear.
Her heaven would be a love without betrayal.
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.

[Verse]
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way

[Outro]
There is a curse,
That will be broken.
One thousand girls raise their arms.
Now that reconciliation is possible,
If we gonna heal,
Let it be glorious.

[Intro]
What I learned from the dope game

[Verse 1]
If I learned one thing 'bout the dope game
Put shit pay now, nigga, even if you ridin' with 'em
And when they learn what you got in your couch at the spot
That how lame niggas get shot
If I learned one thing, about the dope game
It's niggas ain't shit and bitches ain't neither
Real nigga never gon' rat
And never gon' leave without a Heater
What I learned from the dope game
Don't mix weed, cocaine, they ain't with you for the smoke, man
Get you an elbow of head bands, take it to the head, man
Fuck what all them sucker niggas said
What I learned from the dope game
Trust no nigga no time, even when a homeboy co-sign
So he say he got a coke line, don't be talkin' like that on your line
That how you get more time
What I learned from the dope game
With big risk, low reward though, the more you get away, the more, you can afford more
Dress up like you goin' to award shows
But if you live by the sword, dyin' by it, better know it
What I learned 'bout the dope game
Is how to take a lil of that and turn it into somethin'
You could bestow another woman
Start hustling the spring, by the summer, you'd be stuntin'
Sheesh, get your baby and your baby mama on some money, shit die Louis, twelve hunnid
What I learned from the dope game
If you trappin', make it happen
And word never overrule action

[Hook]
What I learned from the dope game is what I know
What I learn what I know
What I learned from the dope game that what I know
That what I learn what I know

[Verse 2]
What I learned from the dope game
We recognise, never talk about it
Like how to make a million out of crack house
No, and you ain't need to know that
'Cause you probably been in jail, you don't wanna go back
And jail givin' years like the number on the throwback
But you already know that
What I learned 'bout the dope game
Shit, quite sober
You don't never trap without an umbrella
And don't believe the judge can try and tell you what you give him
If he ain't got no money then all he said is, "I'm finna"
What I learned 'bout the dope game
Take shit from no nigga
And never go to sleep around a stripper
When niggas come to get you, the bullet miss you, it whistle
Nigga, go get nigga the issue
What I learned 'bout the dope game
Hard work ain't God work
When you feed your family off of hard work
Try to go to church, keep God first
Stray bullet put you in a hearse
What I learned 'bout the dope game
A nigga gon' talk
If it ain't a bank roll, take a walk
And give a damn what a sucker nigga thought
Fuck around, get knocked off
What I learned 'bout the dope game
Broken life, broken home
A generation full of rollin' stones
Even though I'm grown
Wait for the nigga still got it goin' on

[Hook]
What I learned from the dope game is what I know
What I learn what I know
What I learned from the dope game that what I know
That what I learn what I know
What I learned from the dope game
It's a balloon far away that I can see far away
Like the balloon flying away that is usually seen
And it has an odd shape in the distance
That doesn't diminish it stays in my sight
And doesn't finish

Then a slight swirl
Takes over my mind
My irises return
After being miles away!

Then I find that there's no balloon
Like the balloon usually seen
But some type of insect
Like the insect
Usually hanging right in front of me

And I walk towards it and I take another step
Now I find myself right below, right below, it...
Now here I am!
Below the spider
Hanging from its thread
Hanging from the tree
No it's not a balloon far away that I can see far away
No it's not a balloon far away
No it's not a balloon far away
No it's not a balloon

[Verse 1]
Light shinin' on pomegranate trees
Shinin' on you, shinin' on me
Making love and all things
With smiles on our faces and no one gets home
Oh yes that they continue to roam wherever they are

It was a good time, a place of plentiful food
Where to explore and smother our soul
But that season exists in my memory as
I gaze into the frame reflectin' my home
And my people that I long for

[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting here on the west side

[Chorus]
Waiting for time to pass
Waiting to hitch a ride on inspiration
A breeze of energy that will guide me to one
A place of peace, a place where love
Baseless, nurturing fruit in the desert
Baseless, nurturing fruit

[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting here on the west side

[Chorus]
Waiting for time to pass
Waiting to hitch a ride on inspiration
A breeze of energy that will guide me to one
A place of peace, a place where love
Baseless, nurturing fruit in the desert
Baseless, nurturing fruit

[Outro]
Baseless, nurturing fruit (6x)

[Shout outs]

[Chorus]
Trappin' n cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the blocks
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' n cappin' i'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots

AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot

[Verse 1]
Sittin in the trap, money in my face
Trappin' n cappin' i'm switching from state to state
Mansion or condo I switch up the low case
100 thousand cash just for motivation
Jumped out the Wraith, then I hop in the i8
Derek Jeter, hit the pot like I beat the case
Pulled out a pistol, I shot with a K
Money get shooter and they poppin' shit broad day
1 M, I just made it today
Came up from trappin' n cappin'
I ate everything on the plate
Smokin' on rocks, now I'm high in space
Call up my lawyer, you know he gon' beat the case
Got the Draco, know we shoot with the 38
Grippin' the rocket, I know that these niggas fake
Ferragamo on me, rockin the Gucci snake
Pull out the draco, he shot in the face

[Chorus]
Trappin' n cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got the guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot
Trappin' n cappin' i'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and pots
I come from trappin' n cappin', now I got that guap
Draco pull up, and I spray your block
I'm trappin' n cappin', watching for the cops
I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot

[Verse 2]
Big Soulja, i'm the big homie
Mini Draco, gotta keep it on me
I came up from trappin' n cappin', they act like they know me
Put the bricks in a figure-four
I stand at your front door, ski mask with the Draco
Who wanna bih' homie, shoot when I say so
Came up from trappin' n cappin' for pesos
150 bricks down Santiago
2018, Bentley truck Forgiato
Trappin' n cappin' M's in Wells Fargo
Bricks coming in, swipe em by barcode
Trappin' n cappin' i'm smokin' Gelato
100 pounds, nigga hit the lotto
Givenchy on me, I'm fly Aeropostale
Flip it like Future, this shit get colossal
Hop in the Lamborghini, full throttle!

[Chorus]
Trappin' n cappin' I'm whippin' the pot
I post up Zone 1 with the pans and the pots
I came up from trappin' n cappin', now I got the guap

I walk around with the bands on the block
AP on my wrist, I'm sitting at the top
I fell in love with the Pyrex, I whip the pot

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just another bombtrack
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fade this
But, I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat-downs
Cold run a train on punk ho's, that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge, and delete
Those who compete, at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall, and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views, that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
The landlords and power whores, on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, and then watch 'em burn

[Bridge]
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
The landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and I watch 'em burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

[Verse 2]
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
Yeah now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if you interfere

[Bridge]
With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
The landlords and power whores on my people they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite, then I watch 'em burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

Yeah watch them burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

[Verse 3]
Yeah I tried to look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner Holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize, was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit DDT - yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, and the profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin, path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, just a prophet lost and learned
I got to break 'em off and watch 'em burn

[Chorus x7]
Watch 'em burn

[Intro]
I love you too
I love you too
I love you too
You know, I love you too

[Verse 1]
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
We think the same things
I wanna take this seriously, oh (oh)
Don't wanna dance alone
So come here with me
You're made of glass, I'm made of stone
One more thing to say before you go

[Chorus]
I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I’m not afraid, it’s okay
You know, I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too

[Verse 2]
Now you're with me, and now I'm with you
We're here forever
How does it feel knowin' the truth? Oh (oh)
Don't wanna dance alone
So come here with me
You're in a class, all of your own
One more thing I've got to let you know

[Chorus]
I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I’m not afraid, it’s okay
You know, I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too

[Bridge]
You know I never really thought about
How it feels to say these words aloud
It's so weird, but it's true
Do you ever even think about
How it feels when you are not around?
I'm gonna stay here, 'cause I love you too
'Cause I love you too

[Chorus]
I don’t talk a lot, talk a lot
So you should listen up, I mean it when I say
I’m not afraid, it’s okay
You know, I love you too, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too
I love you too, I love you too, I love you too
You know, I love you too

[Intro]
All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control

[Verse 1]
Both got the feelin’
Hit like karate
Had boyfriends and girlfriends
We wanted to touch, but we could never make any moves
Both got the feelin’
Guilty desire
Your body, my body
We were close, but still so far away

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

[Chorus]
All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional

[Verse 2]
The car in the driveway
The questions in her mouth
This secret is risky
So we have to keep all these fantasies to ourselves
Clothes on the carpet
Over at my house
I wish we could do it
We came so close, but still we push away

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

[Chorus]
All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

[Chorus]
All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
(You got me so emotional)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Yeah, it's so emotional
Verse 1: Jamie
When I first saw you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I find you
And I have had the most beautiful dream
Any man's ever had

Verse 2: Beyonce
When I first say you
I said oh my
That's my dream
That's my dream
Oh, I needed a dream
To make me strong
You were the only
Reason I had to go on
Hook:
You were my dream
All the things that I'll ever knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they would ever come true
And who could believe
The world would believe
In my dreams too

Bridge: Jamie
Before, you appeared
Life was only a game
And day in
And day out
Were the same, oh

Beyonce:
Now a dream
Coming true
Like a star
See it shine

Both:
A dream
That is yours
That is mine
Jamie:
You were my dream

Beyonce:
Now I got dreams of my own
Dreams you'll never know

Both:
You won't take my dream from me

When I first saw you
I said oh my
I said oh my
That's my dream

[Verse 1]
Boom bam, I know you wanna give me somethin'
Since your boy blown up like a bubble gum
Best believe I'm known to get gutta with it
Your booty's a bubble, I'ma call you my bubblicious
Straight from the gutta, I ain't stutta, I'm gutta with it
So come and get it like you wanted
To get it since "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)"
I'ma keep it bouncing like six, four, rolling through your hood

Oh damn, I know you gotta feel me, son
'Cause I'ma spit 'round here like a Tommy gun
It's gon' blast in your ear

And I heard you want it, baby

Shawty in the front seat
Straight tripping tryna go for my heat

I’m driving in my car
Upon this crowded star
It’s been my longest night
Under this full moon light
As her brother Sun begins to rise

The new year’s passed it’s almost dawn
My present situation is this song
It turns my life into a reel
I sit back and watch it play

The clock it ticks it never stops
Melting memories into teardrops
Shedding my past lives, loves, and everlasting pain and joy

But I’m in the future now
With feet on the earth and hands on the branches that I climb
Within the waves that carry me
And now I’m sinking deep into her soul
Like floating in the ocean we breathe to control
The rhythm of our place in time
In cycles of existential rhyme
Take a trip
Along with us
Eroding breaking what we must
In order to feel lust

A breeze in the cloud
Creating flight in our memory
Memory is all we have

And if we have none we sink in the ground
Searching like moles for our minds
Melting into the Magma
So if memory was a woman
Magma would be her name
And I call it and I ask her

Magma what was the first words I said
And why did I say them
Magma you know cause you melted my bones and my brains
I see you late at night when I dream
Magma you are my warm blanket that leaves me when I wake
Please don't go
When I call
You better show

[Intro]
Lord, we come to you
Asking you for the strength and the guidance
To be man enough to protect our children
'Til the day that we die, Amen

[Verse 1]
Devotion to that higher ground
Each day by day, he's slowly fading
It's like we can't hear the sound
So I gotta be innovated
He sending all over the world now
We need to start making changes
The light is covered up by the clouds
And my life's constantly raining

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think about the things you've done for me
And how you made me see, truthfully
I ain't gon' do you wrong, no
Don't let no one of us go because I know

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna save me (Save me)
Gonna save me (Save me) from the sins I've done (Sins I've done)
Nobody's gonna save me (Save me)
Gonna save me (Save me) 'cause it's all my fault ('Cause it's all my fault)
Nobody's gonna save me (Save me)
Gonna save me (Save me) from the belief I've lost
Nobody's gonna save me (Save me)
Gonna save me (Gonna save me), so I'm praying to you God (Praying to you God)

[Verse 2]
It's not safe to say it's over now
We're here, now see
Little bodies laying on the ground
It coulda been your baby
Is someone gonna help us out?
They need some food to eat
But there'll be brighter days
When we'll be saved
The Lord will send blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think about the things you've done for me
And how you made me see, truthfully
I ain't gon' do you wrong no
Don't let no one of us go because I know

[Chorus]
Nobody's gonna save me (Gonna save me)
Gonna save me (Gonna save me) from the sins I've done (Done)
Nobody's gonna save me (Nobody's gonna save me)
Gonna save me (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 'cause it's all my fault (Fault)
Nobody's gonna save me (Save me)
Gonna save me (Save me) from the belief I've lost (Woah-oh)
Nobody's gonna save me (Save me)
Gonna save me (Save me), so I'm praying to you God (Praying to you God, praying to you God)

[Outro]
Every step that we take from this day, oh Lord
We both hope that it's one of your directions (Save me)
So take this song as a token of our affection (Save me, woah-oh)
We both apologize, Amen (Save me)
(Save me)

And she can buy her own red bottoms
But I don't really care 'bout that

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Girl, you know I love to lick it, lick it
And you like it when I lick it, lick it, oh yeah
Girl, it's hard to fight your feelings
And I can't lie, you know I love it
Come on, baby, that's a big mistake to shake your ass
You know I can't control my dick when you start moving that
I close my eyes but I can still feel that ass
On my body

[Chorus]
Baby, don't fall in love, don't you fall for me (don't you fall, baby)

Girl, you know I got a problem with you, yeah
'Cause you ain't right, no, girl, you ain't fair, no
You don't even seem to know how you be messing with me, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
So what am I supposed to do when all I wanna do is claim you?
So what am I supposed to do when you be looking the way you do?
You don't recognize there's something about ya, little ma
You don't realize I wanna be with you, little shawty, yeah

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to keep my cool
When you be coming 'round, you be hanging out?
Tell me what do you expect for me to do?
Girl, you're so right it just ain't right, no

Girl, girl, you just don't know, I'm tryna be solo
But you're so right it just ain't right, no

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you got me giving up on my homies
And I don't go out at night 'cause we do what I like

We had a Stoned Soul Picnic at the park
Nappy haired proud brown people
Singing in the dark

We had a Stoned Soul Picnic at the park
Barefoot breathing heavily as we run
Barefoot breathing heavily
Playing soccer in the sun
We had a Stoned Soul Picnic at the park

Smile, Smile, Smile on
Beautiful people always smiling
Showing their teeth that Shine
Shine, Shine on
Like the sweat on her brow
Falling, kissing the earth

That shakes because it feels warm inside
Oh yes it moves us
Placing happiness in our souls
Placing happiness in our souls
That we can feel as we look into each others eyes
And there we get lost we dissappear like flies
Searching for the fruit that i'm so glad we've found
Rejoicing when we eat it

Yes we love its lovely sound
Taking us off the ground
Volcano explodes
Yes we love its lovely sound

Hummingbird moving fast
Sipping nectar from the flower
Love grows by the hour
Yes we love its lovely sound
Yes we love its lovely sound
We love its lovely sound
Yes we love its lovely sound

We had a Stoned Soul Picnic at the park
Nappy haired proud brown people
Singing in the dark
We had a Stoned Soul Picnic at the park
Barefoot breathing heavily as we run
Barefoot breathing heavily
Playing soccer in the sun
We had a Stoned Soul Picnic at the park
Vida e que voce faz
E! que voce…... faz!

And as I wake up
I see the light
I wake up
I see the light
So then I’m there the sun is bright
I am the move
I’m taking flight

Call me Sunshine lady
Your colors have filled me with so much love
Flying dove we’re high above
All the things you see
Come and fly with me
We’re already there
When we stare in each others eyes
There’s no thoughts theres only peace
There’s only love
There’s only love

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
Shawty wanna rock with me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't stand against the wall, girl, take it to the floor
Shawty, keep it low for me
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
You say you wanna stall with me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't trill against the wall, let's take it to the floor
Show me what you got for me, for me

[Verse 1]
The night is young so let's get this party started
Show 'em how to get down on the floor
Ladies looking sexy from the couple I done spotted
Man, their bodies were outta control
Hormones racing and females chasing
Man, can't stop feeling the beat
Girl, bodies shaking like she's seizing, faking
Now I know she getting low with me

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
Shawty wanna rock with me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't stand against the wall, girl, take it to the floor
Shawty, keep it low for me
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
You say you wanna stall with me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't trill against the wall, let's take it to the floor
Show me what you got for me, for me

[Verse 2]
It's crack-a-lacking, now it's krump up in the party
Finger tingling down to the bone
Who's this mean mugging me, acting so retarded?
I'ma have to throw some blows
Players hate me 'cause the ladies crave me
And they getting up off they feet
They coming over and they ass is swole
But they wanna rumble with me (Oh, no)

[Chorus]
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
Shawty wanna rock with me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't stand against the wall, girl, take it to the floor
Shawty, keep it low for me
Uh oh, uh oh, there goes another one
You say you wanna stall with me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't trill against the wall, let's take it to the floor
Show me what you got for me, for me

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When I was on 'gram entertaining all the rap beefs
We was on the hood goin' to war on the backstreets
Bulletproof Caddy like who said they gon' get at me
Pull up in your hood, niggas running like a track meet
No more Rollies, I'm just buying more properties
Young niggas watching me, give 'em that game properly
Past go twice, skip jail, build a monopoly
Don't let 'em trick you outta your spot
Nigga you gotta be retardo if you could treat me out this new Gallardo
Since I been gettin' it, ain't miss a season from Ricardo
Tisci when they see me, know me at Wells Fargo
Still rappin' like it's no tomorrow
So I don't have to stand, let me borrow
And let you in my circle, but that's coming with a cost though
You don't work, you gon' starve yo
Dime in the crib, tip-toeing on the marble
Rockin' all this ice, I'm just tryna hide my scars tho
Somethin' 'bout that Wraith and them lights, how them stars glow
Give me motivation, out in Miami, know the Haitians
All the hitters got the bitches and I'm MMG
A legend on Collins how they gon' remember me
Young niggas

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
The land they gave us was always ours
Don't close the door, you owe us more, uhh
I know that it's hard to face reality, mm
And when they changed, they were all surprised but me
And we buy Wraiths to hide behind these stars, yeah
And we rock all this ice just to hide these scars
If you never seen a dream fade away behind all these bars
And only God can touch your soul behind all these bars, oh

[Verse 2: Future]
Patek on, iced out, yeah yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Hundred rounds, brrr, spend live by (Brr)
Drankin' purple lean, fuck Moscato
Ridin' in them Wraiths like a shotta (Skrrt skrrt)
Skipped out of school, whipped a deuce to a four
Chanel on my whore, got the marble on my floor
Ten mil' deal  just to wear Diadora
I secure the bag first round, that's of course
Cocaina white inside, that's a Porsche
Came from the gutter, nigga trapping is a sport
Young nigga don't spray the drum in the court
Pass the Actavis, pop the seal like a cork
They running out of info, making rumors, what's your source?
Friends turned to foes, niggas leavin' me no choice
Hoes gettin' exposed, make a nigga cut them short
Hit a few licks before I made it out of choice

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
The land they gave us was always ours
Don't close the door, you owe us more, uhh
I know that it's hard to face reality, mm
And when they changed, they were all surprised but me
And we buy Wraiths to hide behind these stars, yeah
And we rock all this ice just to hide these scars
If you never seen a dream fade away behind all these bars
And only God can touch your soul behind all these bars, oh

The way you used to tell me I was just too young (Oh)
Girl, you know what you was doing (What it do? What it—)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I bet you thought it would never be CB in the Lambo (Lambo)
Pulling up in suicide doors ('Cide doors)
'Bout a year, a couple of years back
Told me I could get it if I was only a couple years older (Years older)
But it's clear that I'm 61, stunting off and running
And legal to feed you what your heart wants
We done a lot of talking but I'm tired of talking
Tell me what you offering, so I can get to giving what you want

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And we can be the first one to try out my tub, just got it
With the automatic jets and bubbles, real private
We ain't never gon' have no interruptions
Don't worry 'bout my homeboys, knocking at the door, they'll be no interruptions

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]
Tell me what it is (I need to know what it is)
Show me what we doing (Yo, tell me what we doing)

Get down, all the ladies get down
I done gave you another hit with your favorite Chris Brown

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
In the background, you're playing my songs (Run It! Run It! Run It! Run It!)
Won't you tell me what you got on?
And better yet, baby, won't you shoot me a flick quick
Message with all the things you been speaking of
All grown up for real now
Been wanting to get at you for so long
'Cause we done been up in the 'lac
And you remember, "Gimme, Gimme That"
Trust me if I hit it
You gon' recognize it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
And we can be the first one to try out my tub, just got it (Try out my tub)
With the automatic jets and bubbles, real private (Jets and bubbles, yeah)
We ain't never gon' have no interruptions
Don't worry 'bout my homeboys, knocking at the door, they'll be no interruptions

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]
Tell me what it is (I need to know what it is)
Show me what we doing (Yo, tell me what we doing)
You had me going on the phone all night long, now I wanna get to it (What it do? What it—)
Shawty, like for real (What it do? What it—, shawty, for real)
I always knew it (What it do? What it—, you already know)
The way you used to tell me I was just too young (Oh)
Girl, you know what you was doing (What it do? What it—)

[Verse 1]
As I was walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

[Verse 2]
I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me
Yeah

[Chorus]
No existe nadie que pueda pararme
Por el camino de libertad
No existe nadie que pueda hacerme volver
Esta tierra es para ti para mi

[Chorus]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters
Esta tierra es para ti y para mi

[Intro]
Baby Drew, turn it up

[Verse]
Only 15 minutes 'til your mama comes home from work and I know, ha
That she would be tickled pink to find me here, yeah
'Cause even though we was just chilling and a little flirting
She don't even want me anywhere near her baby girl, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
So I think I better leave, grab my coat, hat and Timbos
And bounce through the window
'Cause the last song on the CD is skipping
And I don't want your folks catching me, you tripping

[Chorus]
'Cause she don't think we're old enough to fall in love (In love)
'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks
But she don't see there's more to me than just a thug (That I ain't no thug)
There's nothing you can do when opposites (Ha) attract and it's like that

[Bridge]
All my ladies in the house tonight, say ooh
Yeah, now if y'all wanna fall in love with Chris, say woah, woah
All my ladies in the house tonight, say ooh
Aw yeah, that sounds so good, now say woah, woah (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause she don't think we're old enough to fall in love (She don't think we're old enough, no)
'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks (She don't know how much I love you)
But she don't see there's more to me than just a thug
There's nothing you can do when opposites attract and it's like that
Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams
Funny but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here
They were not after the money, they were not after alcohol
They were after guns and young children to raise as their own
The war had made it necessary to take child captives
The rest would be slaughtered
That is how Miguel O'Brien became a Yavapai-Apache warrior
He was five years old
Chapter 2:

Miguel O'Brien ran with the Apaches
He ran and ran, and as his legs grew he glided over the desert earth

He learned how to hide and to hunt
He learned to leave no tracks and he learned to live on what he could keep down
And his name was now "Eyes Like The Sky"

His blue eyes showed his father's race
He never wore the white painted face of the slave
He was valued for his stamina and distant vision
By the time he was 15, he had already killed Mexican troopers and feared no man
It is 1864 now, and the American's war has not come to the desert lands
They fight among themselves way off to the north
The Yavapai-Apaches are still lords of all they survey
Then one morning the Americans did come
Led by a man holding a leather book with a cross stamped in the leather

An evil man who did terrible things to people
In the name of a god that looked upon the man himself with repulsion
Miguel ran from his wickiup, half asleep when they attacked, the rifle butt sent him unconscious

When he came to, he was trussed-up, on his back, on the ground, looking up at the Americans
He had not been killed because they had noticed his blue eyes and knew he was one of them
So, at the age of 16, Miguel was back among his father's people
Once more, a family he loved had been killed, this time, by Americans
Chapter 3:

The Americans took the trussed-up boy to a place called Fort Whipple
A fly-blown group of tents surrounded by a stone and timber stockade
An American called Willis was the boss there
And he glared at the man of God as he entered with his captives
He noticed the boy when he was brought in with a few Yavapai girls
And he looked into the color of his eyes

"What do you make of him?" he asked the God-man
"He may be the young, O'Brien boy who was lost here years ago
Or he could be from the Jebson party that never made it to New Mexico," said the God-man back
They named the boy Jebson O'Brien
But the natives and frontiersmen called him "Blue" because of his eyes
But also because of the awful and most sad expression he carried on his face
The expression of someone who kills with compassion but not mercy

Although he was still a boy, the men mostly kept away from him, all except for one
A trapper who understood his skills, and in return, fed him and taught him the white man's way
In a short while, he could speak, and read, and write their language
And he also added the calm, fast dignity of a gunman to his arsenal
He was so fast that men treated him with care
But he was slow to anger and when angry, swift and final in his reply
In the Arizona desert in the 1860s
He had every skill that you needed to survive, and he was just 17
Chapter 4:

The God-man with the Bible was in the back room of the chapel at Fort Whipple
The God-man was deeply engrossed in satisfying his goat-lust with a Yavapai girl
She never said a damn thing but just leaned over an altar while he defiled her
He held a pistol to her head as he grunted away
And when he was finished he shoved her towards the outside door
But the God-man never got to fixing his long-johns or his black trousers
The young man named Blue strode softly up behind him and drove a long-bladed knife into his neck

Blood spurted into the chalice on the altar but not the blood of the Christ
Just the blood of the God-man
With a cough, he died and a bubbled gurgle
The young man named Blue took the Yavapai girl, money, guns, food, two strong horses
And rode into the desert, away from Fort Whipple
The God-man's body was found, but he was not missed
Chapter 5:

For days they traveled, the young man and the Yavapai girl
She told him her name and they spoke in the language
They rode the horses until they gave out
Then their throats were slit and meat was taken to eat later
No fires were lit
They ate berries and raw jackrabbit as well to keep going
After a week they relaxed more as they entered Apache area
They saw dust way off like dust-devils but they knew it was horses
They could hear shots and no more

When all was quiet a day later, they moved silently towards the killing ground
The buzzards told them the story before they got there
Dead white people, a lot of them, maybe a half dozen
Burnt wagons and arrows, but not from one tribe
Some of the arrows were different and shot hoof marks
And moccasin tracks that were shaped like a white man's way of walking
Some white men had done this loosely disguised as Apache
They took what they could use and walked on
The purple mountains and red ochre earth swallowed them up
And the young man smelt his own blood as they ran
And it was a good smell, the smell of being alive
Suddenly the girl pitched sideways and a split second later the young man heard the distant shot
He dived for some rocks and watched as more bullets hit the girl
The young man looked to her body and as she died, he worked out where the shots were coming from
He knew death was going to walk on those shooters

Chapter 6:

There is one thing a white man should never do
And that is move towards an Apache​ because you will never get there
How do you catch dust in the wind?
The young man saw the way they were coming by the movement of insects and birds
And he knew where to go
Like the snake, he slithered into a dry arroyo and worked behind the shots in an arc
After a while he saw them: three men, three white men clad in skins
And they walked confidently towards the girl
The young man knew somewhere behind them another one held the horses, making four all together
He moved towards that man
The killers could wait, let them enjoy the hunt before they went under

He found the one by the horses, he was young too
And he died quietly with a surprised indignant look on his face
The young man tied the horses to a tree, and they'd come in handy later, four horses and equipment
By the girl's body, two men knelt beside her while another stood guard
The guard suddenly cried out as his head exploded in a bubble of pink spray and he fell forward
The other two went to ground and nervously called out to each other
"Do you see the bastard?"
"No, he must be close."
But he wasn't
The Sharps sporting rifle will reach a long way in the right hands
The young man took careful aim and the smaller of the two men felt his right leg blast away
The bigger, heavier man sank as far into the ground as he could make himself go
But still, he could not see where the young man was
The young man by now was astride a horse
And making for a Yavapai stronghold half a day's ride away
He had more guns and horses than he needed
And he knew where two white men were sitting in the desert with no water and no horses
White men dressed as Yavapai-Apaches

The white men would be calling for their mothers and their God by evening
But the young man would be drunk on tiswin and full of deer meat
And satisfied by their agony

[Verse 1]
I was fine before I met you
Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control of a vulnerable soul (Yeah)
I am my mother’s daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

[Verse 2]
Hell hath no fury like a woman reborn
And now I'm burning like a blue flame once more
But don't mistake my warmth for weakness
Don't bite the hand that feeds or you'll
You'll never eat, no-oh

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power (Hey)

[Bridge]
And now I'm taking it back
Electric as fuck (C'mon)
You can't quiet this thunder, no (No-oh-oh)
Yeah, I'm taking it back
Lit all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow (I glow, I glow)

[Chorus]
You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours, oh
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes

Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]

Hands, hands in the air!

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Jennifer Lopez]

I just wanted memories with you

[Chorus]
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

[Verse 1]
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

[Chorus]
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some

Baby now you know you got nerve

Drop down, turn around, baby show you like this
Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this

[Verse 3]
'Cause you don't even know what you just lost
You don't even know what you just had
You don't even know, and that's what's bad
Money bag long, that bitch bad
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long

Call my line, call my line, I'm like, "Please, boy"
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

[Chorus]
Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em

Black ice, black seats, yeah I'm bumping Blackstar
Rednecks tell me that I got a nice car
Gotta make sure that I keep my baby clean
This game keep me hungry like I'm Katniss Everdeen
Just got the whip washed
Shining like it's pish-posh
Engine sound like it needs an ad-lib from Rick Ross
No I ain't M.M.G
But my next purchase might be an M3 (sheesh)
Sicker than most, look at the folk
Trippin for dollars so holler for gold
Picking apart my problems
Like when Peter Piper picked his nose
Whip looked like it got dipped in a cherry coat
Mercedes' same color as the hair on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

I said hey pretty girl I'm feelin' yo frame
Show that tattoo girl what that nigga name?
Aye pretty girl I'm feelin' yo frame
Show that tattoo I bet he ain't Lil Wayne
Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend my lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall, when stars were bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale told his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart, it will always remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

[Verse 1]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you looking up to me and talking down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Woah)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, popping
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting)
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2]
V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

[Chorus]
I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

[Outro]
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home
Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

I got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that: "All aboard!"

Seven, that's the time we leave - at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back

I never though my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the "I Am" (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, poppin'
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016, burnt some discs
2017, ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique, on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "Issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

[Hook: Frank Ocean and A$AP Rocky]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Our lives are factual and actual
Plus you natural and match well
Burdens on my back look like a shell
Purple act, I'm moving like a snail
Both sides even like equal
Both eyes gleaning like a scale
Green and blue, hundreds turning teal
Green and blue, money colored tales
Was such a good guy to Chanel
'Til she caught me sleeping with Charel
The Range, Royce, ring, like Pharrell
Bling so she see that I'm for real
Picture me, a fire burn in Hell
Photography like David LaChapelle
Black lapels and nappy ponytail
Make 'em call me Flacko Lagerfeld

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful

And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know

[Instrumental]

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But it's beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know
Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart
When you're all alone
All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Ev'ry single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Still the old heart's young enough to say

"It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
"Truly lovely, wasn't it?"
Strings
Ev'ry single lovely day
One dream in my heart, one love to be living for
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]

C'mon

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Uhh, gangstas niggas and bitches
I'm back on my A game is you getting the picture? (Whattup)
And last album they don't like me to tell this
They undershipped my records ain't expect me to sell shit (Shut up)
That's what they telling me, switch up yo' melody
You hot but you go pop, your record'll be selling three
Fuck off, I ain't no damn puppet
Imma do what I wanna do just as long as my fans love it
And if that can't cut it, fuck it, drop me
Watch me blow up on another label I'm cocky
You better realize pa, I'm a real live star
Ask your kids if they feel my bars they'll tell you hell yea
Ask him is he just running his mouth or is he really the one to look out for
They'll tell you hell yea, he's the one to look out for
He's not just running his mouth y'all (Uh-uh, no way)
I been hotter than you dudes
To me this shit is easier than tying my two shoes
You young cats sound old and retired like yo flows on a diet
You ain't feeding the people right
It's like food when I rap
They get fooled when I rap
Like Slick Rick said, the ruler is back

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
8 AM, open my eyes
Yeah, kick my bitch, tell her open the blinds
And I'm over the stove at 9
Yeah I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine
Yeah quick line in the bathroom before we bounce
Not me, I mean her, she go a-day-an ounce (dang)
Y'all pray for her
While I'm at the bus station in the Bentley sitting low as I wait for her
I'm gettin' dough, I'm a paper-boy, I will take you
For the right paper boy I will take her
Shake her, tape her, waist up
Send her to the money, she be back before I wake up
Get ya cake up
Y'all niggas lame ducks
You probably get your game up when I'm giving the game up
My name Wayne, what
Hot boy flame up
You niggas trying to change up and I'm getting my change up

[Intro]
I hate gossip
And I don't walk around lookin' for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just
Wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop

[Verse 1]
Stop hating on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped like you're waiting on a nigga
Put a body bag and an apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'ma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm trying to be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fucking po-lice
My flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark some of them even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light, you just might, might wanna...

[Chorus]
Think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby

[Verse 2]
Stop analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Confident, got the heart of the biggest lion
Confident, like fuck them all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city 'cause my city's crying
'Cause my city's dying, but I emerge from all of that
I am a living pioneer, Zion
Fear God, not them, steer my robin Coupe
Through the streets of the boot and soowoo
And then I leak blood in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry, there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
Like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, where New Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I must ask

[Chorus]
Hey, haven't I been good to you?
Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

[Verse 3]
Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I've graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica, where weed be
Hard body nigga, taking it easy
All about my paper, 'bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers lie to fans, lie to rappers?
Lot of rappers lie like actors, cut the motherfucking cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
I am Hip Hop
And I ain't dead, I'm alive

[Intro]
This some real shit
Uh
Know what I'm saying, it's like I can't even
I can't even like, Just fuck it
You'll hear it in the verse
Uh, yea
Got me fucked up
Uhh, uhh

[Verse 1]
Swear it kill me when I see you with that other dude
I feel confused cause I can never find another you
But shit, your lover had me sicker than a sudden flu
I play the horns for you baby, like them truckers do
Shit, your new man, he a buster too
So if he talk, tell him Lanez said what the fuck he do
I know it's been a couple years, he's still in love with you
Got me jumping off a cliff without the Huxtables
And all that bullshit, baby, it just sets me back
I know I fucked up, but that ain't how you get me back
C'mon, baby, that ain't nothing but wrong, baby
Can't say it too your face so I'm making this song baby
This shit is extra hard, You did me extra raw
I say it clear with no punchlines or metaphors
I never had the time, a new man you vibe
Wish I could rewind the hands of time
Foreal

[Outro]
It's like I can't even
Can't even really express the next verse
It's just like, fuck it
I ain't even gon' do it
I sing straight, look
It's kinda hard saying shit to ya face
So I do it over snares and bass
Uh
It's hard saying shit to ya face
So I do it over snares and bass
It's Lanez

[Intro]
Let's find a spot
Here under the stars
With nothing but sky
Between you and I

[Verse 1]
Oh, how the time seems to stop
With your face in my hands
With such trickery, See
how it's flying away
And there's nothing i can do
but cling to you my love and thank the stars
I lived a dream with you

[Verse 2]
Oh how my heart seems to stop
When you're here in my arms
With such trickery, See
how it's flying away
And there's nothing i can do
I lived a dream with you

[Intro]
Tory: Ay, yo y'all remembered last summer though, cuz
Man I had this bangin' shorty last summer. Fly too and super-duper cute

Friend 1: Yo Lanez man, I told you about that 

[?] shit, player

Tory: So what y'all tryna say, y'all don't believe me b? Y'all don't believe me?

Friend 2: Explain yourself

Tory: I'll explain it right now, listen

This is that 90s shit. Yea yea y'all, yea yea y'all
Listen here, it's the freshman o' the year y'all
Like yea yea y'all, yea yea y'all
I got a story to tell, it's right hear y'all

[Verse 1]
Now when I met this one girl early October (alrigh')
Late night clubbing where the girlies not sober
All the Autumn leaves were falling, but it barely got colder
A hoodie season beginner wear, seems we lost quota
I 

[?] a couple times but my lines crossed over
Told her that I don't drive because I got chauffeured
She took all my rich words and swissed all the mixed slurs
So off a this, I'm thinking yo this is my chick, word
We moved on to dinner dated with the Crouton
To even bigger date, Interstate, with the roof gone
I'm thinkin', yo I really like this girl

[?] got me tryna wife this girl, now-e-e
And since I'm thinking wedding gowns in the future
F them, ye man, settle down with the cuter, Kama Sutra
Sheets up, umbrella upstairs
She lay me on the sofa and took over from there, yea

[Chorus]
Your'e that girl
With the 

[?] I've never seen
And I swear that your so fine
You send chills right to my spine
So I hope you commit to being mine
My summer girl, oh yea yea
To share with my whole world (know you my whole world)
So my love (oh oh oh oh), you know I need that summer love
That summer love (Let's break it down)
That summer love (yea)
You know I need that summer love (I need it baby)

[Verse 2]
So then I woke up, low cut, fade on my brain
Feel great, engraved her name on my chain
Sweet, One of the same, Her chain, it read 'Lanez'
Had the Cat Woman dance, black braids and red frames
Word is born, listen to the words of this song
Might think a happy ending, well your version is wrong
Yo my love life is close to the dung
I woke up in the morning, couldn't see her like a verse in the song
Shorty was magic
She vanished like a hat in a rabbit
I'm psychiatric, I'm thinking like that chick was attractive
Now I'm looking at the table there
A label there? No it's a letter and it's made to share
I read the letter, it read:
My love, Lanez, had to leave and it's a bummer
But keep me in your dreams, I'mma see ya next summer
For no particular reason, she was leaving for a season
Instead cheefing, I just listened and kept on dreaming, One Love

[Chorus]
Your'e that girl
With the 

[?] I've never seen
And I swear that your so fine
You send chills right to my spine
So I hope you commit to being mine
My summer girl, oh yea yea
To share with my whole world (know you my whole world)
So my love (oh oh oh oh), you know I need that summer love
That summer love
That summer love (yea)
You know I need that summer love (I need it baby)

[Outro]
Yo son, she was driving me wild then. I was like damn
Know what i'm saying, shorty was like the black Marilyn Monroe for real
She was good from the stay, I was right there. You feel me though?
I'mma see you next summer though Kim, fo real
But until then, you know it's summer love, cause she be driving me outa my mind
Hope I see that bitch next summer, ha ha ha ha
Put me in though

[Intro: Eric Thomas & Meek Mill]
You have to eat the dream
You have to sleep the dream
You have to dream the dream
You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when it's not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream
Yeah, any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with Oodles of noodles, now we eating lobster

[Verse: Meek Mill]
As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and the losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou', lawyer said we lookin' awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs, take them off us
Lil' bitch, call me Lil' Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, it's still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli' last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different, I'm like "Lord be my witness"
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon, do division, break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen, they ain't see the vision
When I had a foreign them bitches know I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah!
My nigga bail half a milli, he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's beef
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches (Trenches)
Top of the food chain, head of commission ('Mission)
We wackin' niggas without permission ('Mission)
Never was personal, it was business (Brrrrr!)
Settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds (Brrr!)
If it was "Fuck them niggas" then
It's fuck them niggas now, fuck 'em!
Never change on my roll dawgs
'Bout that Cain bang them thangs like we O-Dog
Walk up in a dealer and I pull that rolls off
These niggas said I wouldn't make it like I told y'all
Ahh!

[Intro]
Whoao
ohhooo
ohhooo

[Verse 1]
I can't believe my eyes
They're wearin' a disguise
They wanna take control
My body and my soul
They feel it every time
You give to me to crime
(Michael)
I had the strangest dream
I was a demon's toy
Why won'tcha let me be
(That's how were tryin')
They locked me in a cage
Just feels me up with rage
(Michael)

[Chorus Break]
Never before have I ever complained
Livin' my life neither demon nor saint
Seein' my anger becomin' a sin
Reach for the danger my evil twin

[Hook]
Danger is the game
No chance to get away
You got to play withem'
You gotta fuse with me
Danger is to blame
Go back from where you came

[Verse 2]
Why did you call me dead
Why don't you set me free
Why won't you let me be
(A lover in the) fire
A lover
What did you really see
(Michael)

[Rock Break]
Never before have I ever complained
Livin' my life neither demon nor saint
Seein' my anger becomin' a sin
Reach for the danger my evil twin

Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

[Verse 1]
I'm that fish in the rental, my fish scale in the middle
Pill man on the low, got the numbers on the Skittles
I'm that boy you wanna fuck I'm that boy that shot you up
I'm that nigga in the hood, drinking liquor iced up
I'm the one you wanna see, if you wanna buy some D
I'm the nigga V-I-P, smoking in front of police
I'm the one don't really care
I'm the one that take it there, and it's Fatboi on the track
And its Gucci Mane La Flair
Haters thought it's over, but it's only the beginning
Never made the league rapper, but I'm thinking independent Bitches tellin' visions Gucci Mane done bought a Bentley
I'm the trapper of the century, hottest thang that hit the city
Gucci!

[Chorus]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

[Verse 2]
I'm a so icy killa, I'm a Bouldercrest Gorilla
And I'm dealing with my niggas, tryna plot on them some scrilla
I 

[?] of you niggas, I ain't hearin' you hoes
Grind on them fours with the Lamborghini doors
So icy stupid guap, crazy chain dumb (dumb)
Would of charged a charm with the short bus retarded one
Damn Gucci Mane La Flair, put it in the air yo
Put it every hole leave, ya bitches except her earlobe

[Chorus - x2]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it

[Bridge]
Drop a whole 40, Glock hold 30
Chrome 30/30, that's all off shorty
Shotgun shorty got more than one body
Don't know karate, but don't tell nobody
Gucci!

[Chorus]
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
Pounds in the basement, pills in the cabinet
Bricks in the closet, money in the attic
Nigga snitched on me, hater violated
I ain't gonna let em slide, I'm just gonna let em have it
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Braggin'
Wastin' all your time just braggin'
When ya' should be busy
Plowin' and a'plantin'
You stand there a'rantin'
Got no harvest, tootin' your horn

Braggin'
You ain't got no cause for braggin'
When your barn needs mendin'
And your lawn needs mowin'
How come you're a crowin'
Like a no-good rooster at dawn

Braggin' 'bout your fishin'
'Bout your horseshoe pitchin'
Bet you always keep the score
Talkin' 'bout your meddle
That's the kind they peddle
Down at the 5 and 10 cent store
Braggin'
Folks ain't got no use for braggin'
If your fields are greener
Folks will hear about it
You don't hafta shout it
Fields were green before you were born
(x2)

[Chorus]
No, I hope you fill her shoes, about to replace you
I swear to god, I hope the next bitch "Ain't Like You"

[Chorus: T.I. & Juelz Santana]
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Straight off the lot's how I get mine
Pick mine
Car clean lookin' like it just been spit shined
24 inches on his rims big
Bout the size of a 2 year old kid (ya digg)
Plus, U-turnin' in that S550
Look like I'm U-turnin' in a jet
Why did he do that
When he just came through
Why did he come back
I'm just frontin' how you, how you?
Diva on my side while the tires burnin'
I be burnin'
I'm schoolin' these niggas that's what you call higher learning
So listen up grab a chair, have a seat
Crack a beer, smoke a blunt
Watch me the captains here
Louis Vuitton sneaks on the pedal
Do 100 for a mile like my feet went to sleep on the pedal
And no longer am I gonna pop tags off my clothes
Dudes need to know I spent big cash on my clothes
No cash on my hoes, just pass all my hoes
To my niggas let 'em hit it then they get passed on some mo'
Got my system amped up and it's rattling the trunk
Niggas know how I get down they just glad it ain't the pump
Bangin'

[Chorus: T.I.](x2)
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo

Drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I can't feel my face
Cocky in the coupe but they love it
Sittin' on buttons, a pair of 20 somethings
Tires so skinny like I'm sitting on nothing
Leather so soft like I'm sitting on muffins
Beating up the block knocking pictures off the wall
Baby I can drop the top and we can talk to the Lord
And you know I got the stash spot, not!
Cause where I'm from you need your gats out, and cocked
Yea, back out the driveway spoiler banging
I'm shittin' on 'em need toilet training
A big baller can't guard me baby, I mean it
Why the girls gotta double team me
Sittin' sideways yea I'm leanin', I go hard
20 G's in each back pocket 'case I fall
I'm stuntin' check my past I get that cash
In the Phantom with Louisiana plates on the ass

[Chorus: T.I.]
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
Rubber burnin, turnin corners, beatin like a congo
A drop top, flip flop, shine thats the chrome glow
Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go
Rubber burnin

Blowin 'dro on twenty-fo', livin how the song go

Mad trees and shrees and dungarees
The city under siege
Kitchen 100 degrees
I love that summer breeze I stand in it til' it freeze
I'm from another creed them S-s-southern G's
I sip Promethazine I lean I stand tall
I'm mean I'm mad raw I'm comin' like fastballs
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right
One of my snippets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat pork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the L
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6
All day

[Lil Wayne]
Ayy yo what up world? This is ya man Lil Weezy F. Baby, believe that. The President, you understand me. Your checking out my people Mick Boogie, aye Mick!! Lets get into it how we do it, dawg
My oh my, what a mighty fine day
The waters are calm, and the boat's on its way
Dream boat
Dream boat
The captain's been waiting so long to set sail
Ever since he saw that little white whale
Dream boat
Dream boat

But when the dream boat picks you up, and never lets you down
Who would want to come back to this place, down on the ground?

[Verse 1]
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Verse 2]
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

[Bridge]
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you

[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar

[Verse 1]
Are you trying to make me fall?
'Cause with a face like that, baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

[Verse 2]
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

[Bridge]
Na na na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Bridge]
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Verse 1]
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love’s a little messy and you are too
Right now I’m scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn’t gonna stray
Swore I’d never let a man in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re the last thing I needed today

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 2]
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can’t talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You’re the last thing I needed tonight

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Bridge]
I’m acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 1]
Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

[Verse 2]
In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

[Bridge]
I'm runnin' right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

[Intro]
I can never read minds
I can tell what's 'gone be
Looking in your eyes, I can tell you 'gone see
Things you desire, you can settle off greed
But it doesn't really matter to me

[Hook]
Uh, I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
How you feelin'
How you livin', bro I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
How you livin'
How you feelin', bro I'm feelin' good

[Verse 1]
I get throwed, take four sips
Get poured, take more sips
Ain't feelin' y'all, I'm grillin' y'all
Cause that's what most of my dough is
I toke it, ran Zone Six
Bitches know what my flow is
I'm drilling broads, my genitals
Cause that's what most of my hoes is

[Chorus]
Gold mouth, full of gold
Nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes

[Hook]
Uh, I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
How you feelin'
How you livin', bo' I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
How you livin'
How you feelin', bo' I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
How you feelin'
How you livin', bro I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
How you livin'
How you feelin', bo' I'm feelin' good

[Outro]
These hoes say I made it, that just mean I'm up
Got an old school Chevy with a styrofoam cup
Got a mouth full of gold, got a pocket full of hoes
Got a closet full of clothes, rocky my jewelry with no stones
I be gettin' gold, I be, I be, gettin' throwed
I be sippin' 'till I'm old, I be pourin' 'till I'm floored
Tell these bitches "hit the floor"
Take of the panty, give me them clothes
Bitches know they only hoes, X and O's they couldn't 

[?]
Queen-ass nigga, pretty, pretty, motherfucker
Pop that fucking pussy, show it, show it, to these motherfuckers
When the fat lady sings that means the show's over
So I'm leanin' 'till I'm fallin' over, uhh

[Verse 1]
Screamin' west side
'til I D-I-E, bitch
You can see I'm inline
To be the messiah, call me spitfire
That's a fact, me no lie
Your girlfriend hit me like "H-E-Y"
She said, "Young Neezy, come please me"
I cage in the stick, so she love me long time
Shake that ass
Shake it fast, girl, make it clap
Bend your back
Bend your back, girl, make it clap
Mr. O'Reilly, please don't try me
I'll turn your daughter from Topanga to Miley
G-O-D to the five-o'-three
And I tell 'em wake up 'cause the rap game sleep, like

[Chorus]
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The rap game sleeps tonight (awimbawe)
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The rap game sleeps tonight (awimbawe)

[Verse 2]
I'm a young killa
Fuck any dum-diddy-dum dum nigga
Callin' all my real men, this shit is so cold
That my nigga put his headphones on and they froze
Askin' like, "How much a feature?"
"Do you do eagers?" I say, I mean, hey
"You like the coldest," "You prolly don't notice"
I say "Okay, k"
I-I, don't want a rap again
Cause every time I spit, these niggas gettin' to fit in
Don't hop on the beat if you can't hip-hop
Rappers get scared when they shit gets flopped
If you start to warm up, then they say it's all up
Cause nobody give a fuck about they shit they drop

[Chorus]
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The rap game sleeps tonight (awimbawe)
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The rap game sleeps tonight (awimbawe)

[Interlude]
Dem comin' for you
Spit them bars, innit yute

All this melodic thing cool and all, but dem incident

[Bridge]
Awimbawe, Awimbawe, Awimbawe, Awimbawe
Awimbawe, Awimbawe, Awimbawe, Awimbawe

Ah-wee oh awee-bum-bum buh-way
Ah-wee oh awee-bum-bum buh-way

[Verse 3]
If I'm not in your top 5, I'm in a Tahoe
Getting top by 5 hoes
Fuck a mention, I don't pay attention
Twitter make a twat, better makin' niggas do the most
Look, I'm a R-A-P-P-E-R nigga
So sick I'm always in the E-R nigga
You a donkey of the day like a "he-haw" nigga
And these niggas switch sides like a see-saw nigga
Look, I don't get lost in the sauce, I'm gucci
If I was a Pitt, man my nick name pucci
Hoes call me Neezy, I say fo' sheezy
Some days I'm Ghandi, and some days I'm Boosie
The rap game sweet 'til I put the sour in it
The rap game sleep 'til I put a power in it
I could spit all day this easy money
Rappers get scared so they reaching for me
Wait, should I stop? No
Pardon my manners, not here for dollars and cameras
I am a rapper, mother fucker, D-D-D-D-D-Dare me
Don't need to go for the kill, never gotta do plan it
I got a tip-top bitch, she in tip-top shape
Need protection like I got All-State
Don't worry, baby, you in "good hands"
Woulda, coulda, shoulda, niggas never do plan
For the worst, baby, that's a shame
The foolest minds do the foolest things
The cutest kids do the darndest things
But these rappers can't shine so they cop the bling, ding
Is that a light bulb? Maybe it is
The way the game lookin', man, it's breakin' in bits
If a promoter wanna act like he ain't payin' me
We'll give him hits and go ghost like we Amerie

[Verse 1]
I wish I could forget you, wouldn't that be nice?
But I'm reminded of the wrongs we couldn't right
Girl, say your peace, girl, wish you'd a been right
I'm going left, I'm tryna pick me up, hey, girl it's like it is a chase, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh girl, you've been giving me hell
You know, you said it yourself
That I would find no other love, now here I am
Baby, if I could get you, up out my head, maybe for a second now, oh woah

[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't get over you
Chasing my tail like a fool
You got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh)
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere

[Verse 2]
Damn, too important to forget you and it's hard not to miss you
'Cause all I see is flashbacks in my bed, pillow cases, traces of your smell
This thing's going nowhere, you said you needed space but now the coast's clear
Oh, we could have had this so good, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you've been givin' me hell
You know, you said it yourself (yourself)
That I would find no other love, now here I am (and I get further, oh)
Baby, if I could get you, up out my head, maybe for a second now, oh woah (oh)

[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't get over you (you, oh no, no, no)
Chasing my tail like a fool
Girl, you got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh)
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere

[Bridge]
Right around, right around, right around
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere
Baby, if I could get you, up out my head
Maybe for a second now, oh woah

[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't get over you
Chasing my tail like a fool
Girl, you got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh)
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
I may be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

[Intro]
Who, me?

[Verse 1]
I got dressed up
Stepped in the club
I’m kind of new to all this stuff
Don’t kiss and tell
Trapped in my shell
But maybe you’re under my spell

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin’ on tabletops
Champagne bottles go pop
Runnin’ away from cops
Oh no, oh no, oh no
That doesn’t sound like me
Yes, I can guarantee
‘Cause I’ve probably gone to bed by then anyways
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
(Whoops)
She looks a lot like me
Buzzin' in the club like a crazy B
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
“She looks a lot like you”
“Face like an angel with an attitude”
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

[Verse 2]
Text all my friends around these ends
Been saving all these rolled up tens
The next weekend, got cash to spend
Call up my girls, do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin’ on tabletops
Champagne bottles go pop
Runnin’ away from cops
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Don’t think that’s what I did
‘Cause I can’t remember it
You see, I’ve got such a bad memory
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
(Whoops)
She looks a lot like me
Buzzin' in the club like a crazy B
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
“She looks a lot like you”
“Face like an angel with an attitude”
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

[Post-Chorus]
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh)
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh)
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

[Bridge]
My mother always said
That good girls stay at home
So when it strikes twelve I’m in my bed
I’m lyin’ all alone
What, me? Who, me?
Nah, I don’t do this type of stuff

[Chorus]
(Whoops)
She looks a lot like me
Buzzin' in the club like a crazy B
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
“She looks a lot like you”
“Face like an angel with an attitude”
I’m like oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff

[Outro]
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
She looks a lot like me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh)
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
She looks a lot like me
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
She looks a lot like me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh)
Who, me?
Good girls don’t do that type of stuff
(Whoops, oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh, oh-oh)
She looks a lot like me
Who, me?
Hahaha, I don’t do this type of stuff

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Thinking of a master plan, I get money
But I'm thinking of a faster plan, I'm trying to cash it in
I got five in that garbage can
And the wrap saran, I need cash advance
See, I know three sold, the other two a jam
I'mma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can
Hot-ass fuckin' sedan, windows rolled down, no sound
Them bricks got the speakers drowned
I ain't listening for shit but sirens
I ain't trying to get to my ships sunk, fuck you pirates
I'll touch you cowards, it ain't nothing to a boss
The niggas in the hood tryna floss and ya head got a cost, nigga
Take a loss nigga, SS 55
All black, with the top chopped off that
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at
I ain't trying to prove nothing, I'm just trying to move something

[Chorus]
Just 2 dope boys in a Cadillac
It's just 2 dope boys in Cadillac

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now let me introduce the world to my girl
She white, she bright, she shine like a pearl
And I ain't talking 'bout Lindsay Lohan
I'm talkin 'bout that sniff that blow man, (what?) that
One hit that'll get you open
Might make your nose bleed, if it's potent
So if you're not ready, homie don't tamper with it
She the chick who had Tony Montana slippin'
She so bad she make you mad
But soon as you get mad, she make you cash
That white girl, but she ain't always that light
She ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white
Nope; gimme one girl, I mean one gram
I'll teach ya how to give a white girl a suntan
Put it in that pot, 'til it get that hot
Then start to Sir Mix-A-Lot
Aye!

[Intro]
It's Santana, holla at ya boy
Ay Weezy you got me?
I'm bout to take it to these niggas real HD
Real high definition
Ya digg?
Aye!

[Verse]
Sling dope, sling coke, sling pot
Whatever you niggas want I got
Come get it
But I prefer to stand over the same pot
Mix the soda with the coca whip over the same rock, yes
Cars clothes and bankrolls, can't stop
Bank close, I chase hoes? I think not
They chase me you ain't know? I sling cock
I give it to 'em the right way, they stay hot
I break walls, keep em comin' like rainfalls
She take dick, take it all til' she can't walk
She take balls take it all til' she can't talk
I bang her off bang the four til' it's taped off
People gather round like "damn who the tape for?"
Cameras on they like "damn who the tape for?"
Me, it's $59.95 you gotta pay for it
You seen Menace and how O-Dog did it
Well I'm a menace like O-Dog with it, don't y'all get it?
Y'all pussy cats I know y'all kittens
If we was young and it got cold I woulda stole y'all mittens
Now I might just steal y'all ladies
Send her home with a mouth full of stillborn babies
You chumps been lunch meat
My dogs love munching on lunch meat
Here boy, come eat

[Chorus]
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
So money is all I think of
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Money on my mind, money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
So money is all I think of

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Steppin' out the motherfuckin' car
They in awe
I'm looking like a star, bitch
When you see me make a wish
Holla at ya motherfuckin' boy, J.R
Birdman my pa, bitch
Ball bred, born rich
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed
Cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip
And that .40 make a chip
Out a potato-head wimp
Then, like ranch, I dip
And the hustle is all muscle
Just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle
I just lift
I got my hand on the game
Yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist
Same on my wrist
Get key money from a quarter
Blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like hoes
Nigga I'm a pimp
Lil nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money
Baby, now we talking

[Hook]
(Money on my mind)
Yeah, fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
Get money, get money, get money
(So money is all I think of)
Get money, get money, fuck bitches
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
20 grand in the left
Another 20 in the right
Got my wallet in the back
And that thing packed tight
Credit cards don't need 'em
All the birds won't feed 'em
While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin'
E-class on the cell; discussing another mill'
Gucci Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refill
Up in frevay I'm standing on the bar
If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz'
I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox
If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box
Outta town for a month
Came home with a duffel it was one point something
Getting brain and I love it
Pimp, ask Khaled. Lobster salad
Mobster acknowledge I'm popping in Dallas
Pop collars I touch hoes like crep flow
The game in a choke hold
No I won't let go

[Verse 1]
I live off the echoes of your "I love you's"
But I still feel the blows from all of your "don't want to's" (Yeah)
When you're drunk, you say I’m the one
Then you wake up
You suck my hope up in a vacuum

[Chorus]
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu

[Verse 2]
Your words are like Chinese water torture
And there's no finish line, always one more corner
Yeah, they slither like a centipede
Why do you keep me
At the end of a rope that keeps getting shorter?

[Chorus]
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu
So tell me something new
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
'Cause every day's the same
Definition of insane
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu
So tell me something new (Something new)
Figure out the Rubik's Cube
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu (Déjà, déjà, déjà vu)
'Cause every day’s the same (Every day's the same)
Definition of insane (Definition of insane)
I think we're running on a loop
Déjà vu (Déjà, déjà, déjà vu)

[Outro]
Déjà vu
Yo
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
No sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong

[Chorus 1: Hayley Williams with (Taylor Swift)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with (Hayley Williams)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)

[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

[Breakdown: Taylor Swift and Hayley Williams]
Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

[Chorus: Hayley Williams and Taylor Swift]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
Now, I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There’s another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]

[?]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Outro: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Uh, balance
A drunken ground for my niggas
But what if up was down for the liquor?
Then pour in somethin' stiffer
Filter mud from the champagne on blood
Might just milk a tub out my hand vein
Ivy league, I receive, Irie vibes
What a dream! What I mean? Idealize
You see the storm brewin' way up in the heaven
A statue wouldn't mourn 'em, so I wake up to erect, damn
And the bed made of women
Who came first with a head made of chickens?
Break the fast, break the mask on a egg-makin' mission
With X-rated visions
And the glass
I wish that I could live inside jazz
As hecklers shackle magpie
Note-blowin' standard
Scat over improvised ragtime
Red magic, dead rabbit, energize me back dime

[Chorus]
My nigga, what's up?
My nigga, what's up?
My nigga, what's up?
Feather me or let it be
(My nigga, what's up?)
Tether me or sever me
(My nigga, what's up?)
Definitely won’t set me free
(My nigga, what's up?)
No, she look like a set of keys

[Verse 2]
May I die from a hand that is not black
Lie down my crown where Mike Brown dropped at
At the spot where he was unchained
To pour liquor on it and watch a King grow from the blood stains
Then hug him, I'm just here, I ain't here to judge him
I hear the jeers, the cheers, I'm adjusted
It's the day, it's judgement
(Ankh:hers)
For the sippers and the drinkers
Lift her by the shoulders like hangers
Pterodactyls, there are damsels, in their fingers
Ambulance chasers, bad chance, ain't no mash for the bangers
Ash with a bad hand, cash for the danger
Bottom made of glass, shake that ass for the strangers
I'm on the wrath with the danglers, shakin' my shaft
You just bass to the anglers (hooked)
Drift to mausoleum, shackle my feet in 1919
Hollerin' droppin' cosmopolitans on the crime scene
Xenophobian, hemoglobin soakin' on white queens
Pale-face invaders to foreign devils and gaijin

[Chorus]
My nigga, what's up?
My nigga, what's up?
My nigga, what's up?
Feather me or let it be
(My nigga, what's up?)
Tether me or sever me
(My nigga, what's up?)
Definitely won’t set me free
(My nigga, what's up?)
No, she look like a set of keys

[Verse 3]
Has the moon killed the sun yet?
Over dim sum steamed bamboo basket bun sets
A brisk run to keep the lungs fresh
Hung sweats on the radiator
Two shanks for the date rapers and baby tapers
Clear the vision with the spit inside the aviators
Legit but quit because the lick promised them pits of paper
Will we eliminate the innovators?
Will we commemorate the imitators?
You are now set trippin' with eliminators
Life givin' persimmons
So now your lemons persimmon flavored
Why you mixin' different neighbors? Spike it
Now the wrists are slittin' razors
(Ankh:hers)
The benefits of red wine
Drunken box thieves fightin' bars to charge a dead mine
Iron wing Icarus, dip a bit, fly a Siamese chicken strips
Well-designed to keep from liftin' shit

[Chorus]
My nigga, what's up?
My nigga, what's up?
My nigga, what's up?
Feather me or let it be
(My nigga, what's up?)
Tether me or sever me
(My nigga, what's up?)
Definitely won’t set me free
(My nigga, what's up?)
No, she look like a set of keys

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

[Pre-Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she's the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Bridge: Nelly
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool. The folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you

Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you

Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all

Nothin' else for me to say
And so I'll close. Oh, by the way
Everybody's thinkin' of you
P.S. I love you

I do my best to obey all your wishes
I put a sign up. Think
Now I got to buy us a new set of dishes
Or wash the ones that have piled in the sink
Nothing else to tell you, dear
Except, each day feels like a year
Every night I'm dreamin' of you
P.S. I love you
P.S. I love you
Send me back, the feeling's reached the core
Ocean waves sound more like whispers from the shore

See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before

There is no
There's nothing that I need to say

See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
Once before

See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
(Once before)
See my eyes look back again once before

Feeling's in the core
Feeling's in the
Feeling's in the core
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone line rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you
You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

[Intro]
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man

[Verse 1]
Manipulate and cause you pain
But lift you up when you're hurting
Scream goodbye, laugh when you cry
But cool the tears when they're burning
I felt it deep inside of me
Like an explosion of crazy
All of this fire that you give
I feel it deep

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

[Chorus]
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
No need to hear my apologies
For being so damn complicated
The ups and downs, the outs and ins
It's what it is

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

[Chorus]
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
And even when you won't admit
You know you're gonna need
To be next to the only woman who can make you feel that kind of fire
No, you won't get tired
And when you think it's all I got
I'll bring it up a notch
I'll take you on a crazy ride, you'll never get enough
Baby, I'm your girl
And this is how I show my love

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause only a woman can get this dark
Only a woman can cause these scars
Only a woman can love this hard
Only a woman
Yeah, when this woman loves a man
She'll take you to hell and back
Take you to hell and back

[Chorus]
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
How a woman is supposed to love a man
When a woman, when a woman loves
When a woman, when a woman loves a man
Only a woman, only a woman knows
Oh-oh
It's funny how ya' loved me
Then forgot so suddenly
It's funny to everyone but me

They told me this would happen
Now they're laughing secretly
It's funny to everyone but me

I should shrug my shoulders and say
Good riddance to a bad affair
But how can I do what my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care

It's funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
It's funny to everyone but me

It's so funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
Oh, but it's funny to everyone but me

[Intro]
Ayy, man, I went on Instagram, man
My mothafuckin' boy, man
He up there in Boston, shawty
I'm talkin' 'bout, man
Nigga got a whole see-through elevator
You know when you wanna go down, downward or upward?
You know, he get the chance to really see that
Know what I'm sayin'? Wires and everything, for real
(Thugger, Thugger!)
Glass top elevator! Woo, woo!
We got London on da Track!

[Chorus]
We smash on the city, yeah you know it (yeah, you know it)
We gon' smash on these bitches, yeah you know it
Flex up on 'em pussy niggas bad, boy
Crispy hunnids, take your time, count it slow
I'm doin' the thang, I got it bad
I make it rain, we thunder bad
I change the weather, they forecast it
I'm back to factories, no more Davins
No more fightin', no more strappin'
No more dabbin', no more trappin'
No more cappin', no more lackin'
No more raggin', no more naggin' (Thugger, Thugger)

[Verse]
We goin' brazy, break the internet (hey)
We goin' brazy, break the internet
We Rolls Rizzle, the all white, hey
We catch your bitch, we take a flight, wait
The Rollie red like a beam
Fuck your dream and your team, huh
You play with anybody
Turn your shirt to my skin
Hey, we drip on anybody
Get it kicked off the team
Yeah, we richer than everybody
At least that's what it seems
Nigga know we dippin', dabbin'
We spittin' out fire like a dragon
We beat it, beat it with a cannon
That poom-poom look the baddest
My ho from Dallas like a Maverick
Go to Africa to get some karats
Make her call 'em miss, no carriage
Fight 'em all, nigga jabbin'
Cover your face, go to wildin'
Take your whole family to an island
Shoot him in his back, Ricky Bobby
Now I know you get the picture
I want you to stop all the violence

[Chorus]
We smash on the city, yeah you know it (yeah, you know it)
We gon' smash on these bitches, yeah you know it
Flex up on 'em pussy niggas bad, boy
Crispy hunnids, take your time, count it slow
I'm doin' the thang, I got it bad
I make it rain, we thunder bad
I change the weather, they forecast it
I'm back to factories, no more Davins
No more fightin', no more strappin'
No more dabbin', no more trappin'
No more caddin', no more lackin'
No more raggin', no more naggin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady (Excuse me!)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady (Can I have the attention of the class, for one second?)

[Verse 1]
Hi, kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah) Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?(A-ha)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said "Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
‘Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass(whooah)
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C`mere, slut! "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Refrain]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (OW!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians
While they're screaming, "Let's just be friends!"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh hey, thanks)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude,can you sign that)
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

[Refrain]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!(Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too are hairy to hide(Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
"How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!"
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
I'm steaming mad,and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Refrain]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

On the stage with Sofia Vergara
You can hate me but respect me you gotta

I'm the type to take you round the world in a G4 girl
I don't play no games I'm a grown man

You got a couple friends, bring them too
Tonight it's all on you

[Intro]

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl

When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know I'm on my way now
Girl, you know I'm on my way, my way to you
I'ma bring my anaconda
Gonna get to, get to your forbidden fruit
Turn the bed into a jungle
I'm Tarzan, you be my Jane up in this room
Girl, you know I'm finna hunt ya, yeah
You the one I been preyin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thang, do your thang, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal
Animal, uh huh, yeah
Animal

[Verse 2]
This that ghetto Kama Sutra
Twist and bend and bend and twistin' all around
Treat you like you're in danger
And this the last time that I can take you down
That National Geographic (uh huh)
Document it and record it on a film
Anybody got a camera? Uh
Oh, you wanna experiment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat, ayy

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal, woah, yeah
Woah, animal, woah
You bring out the animal

[Verse 3]
I go ape up on the donkey (throw that ass)
I be throwin' this banana all around (sheesh)
Put my face up in the monkey (my mask)
No umbrella but the rain is pourin' down
Kill the kitty, no lion
Big mon, I'm a well up in your sea (for real)
Got your body flyin', oh
No you feelin' like a dove, give me love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack

[Chorus]

With all those freaky thoughts, yeah, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal, woah
Animal, woah
You bring out the animal, grrrr

[Verse 1]
Step one, you say, "We need to talk."
He walks, you say, "Sit down. It's just a talk."
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

[Chorus]
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
So take it easy
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Neon Trees!

[Verse 2]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[Bridge]
Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Well, I won't sleep tonight
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

[Verse 1]
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Fall Out Boy's from Chicago!

[Verse 2]
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you here from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better, cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
My darling, who knew?

Because P!nk is from Philly, ladies and gentlemen!

I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
They can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make you feel unpretty too

That's another song by an artist from Philly, I wanna see if you know it

[Intro: Flo Rida]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before you're screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked

Hot in here, bumping here, making us sweat

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, I,I be on that, wake up in the mornin'

A little bit of sweat won’t hurt
You’re a little bit hot, shawty, wet your skirt
Right up to the top, good sex, no shirt
I don’t wanna stop, baby, that’s the worst
Put in the hole

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey, look, look, look, look, look at your lady

Rip, rip it off, x-rated, sh-shawty we should get naked
Baby girl, that's if you can take it, sip a lil champagne and get faded
Hey, I wanna be the bling, bling
Ride, I'll get in my lane, lane
No time, my girl in the back of the Range
I'll beat like that, make you scream my name
So much cheek, you could touch the plane
Love them freaks when they rock with pain
Be my leach, girl, I want your brain
Wet them feet pretty much like rain
Su-such a mess put your pedicure on my chest
Shawty, you finna to get blessed
In a minute I'ma need my head rest
I don't want you to fight it, you like it, then let's get excited
I'll drop like a pilot, take it off soon as works in the diet

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before you're screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our life through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance
Turn it up
Keep it on repeat
Like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance
Turn it up
Keep it on repeat
Yeah, we think we're free
This one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Chorus 2: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion (turn it up, turn it up yeah)
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (like a wasted zombie)
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
It goes...it goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, on and on it goes
All chained to the rhythm

[Outro]
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up

[Intro: Little Simz]
Uh, it's a win baby
Feels like something's missing, where you been lately?
Tryna tell myself that I ain't in too deep
Give me all of you, and take all of me
This is more than we
How the time flies, know I got my ways about me
Always into mind's eyes, see you sold it to me
Mommy told me he's a nice guy
Know you've got your ways about you too
This is new to me, is this new to you?

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

[Verse 1: Khalid]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
I don't wanna fall in love off of sub-tweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night and

[Chorus: Khalid & Little Simz]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
Oh, you say it's all you need
So you can take control and baby, I'll follow your lead
You say it's best to plan it through, well boy I don't agree
The best things happen unplanned, a result of you and me
This is more than they can teach
Meet me somewhere off the map
I share my location with no one else so don't be late
It's undecided it will determine our fate
Boy would you mind if we continued this off in space?
Earth has never been it for me
All of what I'm envisioning isn't just what the eye can see
Or what the mind can read
Balance is just balance, ying and yang
I'll hold you down if you're here for the madness
Nothing's ever straightforward, but I'm sure that we can manage
I say I'm calm and collected, you say it's passive aggressive
What's with the fightin' and stressin'
I'm not here for that, neither are you, it's not what we do
Maybe I'm just missing your touch, you should come through
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Khalid & Little Simz]
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna rock right now, rock, rock right now

Luda!
I Wanna Rock like Pookie, so here comes the New Jack
Ludacris, reincarnated like 2PAC
(Snoop, roll it up!) But you already knew that
Two blunts together like (Luda, where they do that?)
We call 'em torpedoes, high like eagles
Take two puffs and pass, snatch it like Dee-bo
Unc be in the Regal, Luda in the 'Cut
Pull up with a speaker that'll make your woman shake butt
(Say what?)
Hell yeah, I said it
If I your niigga got beef, then I don't really wanna dead it (Nope!)
I'm too cool for school, too tough to bluff
With a Gucci bandana and some jeans with a cuff
(That's enough!)
I let these rappers have it
They don't even compare to when I put out "Phat Rabbit"
So while you're smoking Bobby Brown and losing
We be choking on that 'purp, betting Whitney Houston's like
(You dig what the fuck I'm doin)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Remix, baby, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I meet you at the spot, send the location
I don't do this a lot, special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie, you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah!

[Chorus: Khalid]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you

Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you

[Verse 3: Kehlani]
Drop me a pin, let's fall
Way deeper into whatever we're callin' it
Whatever we're fallin' into
'Cause I don't really care about rules (Rules)
I don't really care about rules (Rules)
I just really care about you (You)
I'm enjoyin' starin' into (To)
Your eyes when I'm all in it with you
They can choose to watch, but I'd rather they just listen
Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench, us a magic carpet
Little trips to Target turn to avant garde shit
I promise, we got this, we got this
Baby just send me your

[Chorus: Khalid & Kehlani]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)

I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)
Nothing else, but you

But you, but you
Nothing else but you

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma Guetta
Twenty mil' on my off, season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me
Pretty and icy
You get it? Icy
But my name is spelled N-I-C

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl you know I brought that thing right up out the darkness
Made that thing a starfish, right up on my swordfish
I'ma bring sparks and your favorite narcs
Ooooh, you raise the bar, you take it far, you rated R
But keep it tight tight, take this D, go night night
Go so far downtown on you, I lose Wi-Fi
Give me high five
'Cause you know you gon' need a goon to come lick, lick your wounds
Got you lit like tick tick tick, like tick tick tick
Tick tick, Tune

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my (Mula)

When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

[Pre-Chorus: Shelley FKA DRAM]
Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

[Chorus: 2-D]
Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
I put it to the right man
He put it back

[Bridge: 2-D]
Talk to the crowds
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart

You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?
Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya 
They tryna dinosaur us so now it's time to go up

[Refrain: Vince Staples & The Humanz Choir]
The sky's falling, baby

The roof is on fire, she wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere, it's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round Vince on that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit, need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with, them slave bones make Grace Jones
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused, they hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy, them stars falling, don't chase 'em

Attack on Iraq, it's on a line
Typing it fast, then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk, I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage 'cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition, well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness and recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn {Obama} to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

[Refrain: Vince Staples & The Humanz]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

Falling, baby, falling (higher)

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Where does it come from?
When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe?
Through the lithium
Busted and blue

[Verse 2: 2-D]
I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
So amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds I went

[Chorus: 2-D & Kelela]
All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

[Verse 3: 2-D & Kelela]
Where do they come from?
The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body
'Til we're invisible
I'm with you through altitudes
Busted and blue

[Chorus: 2-D & Kelela]
All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

[Outro: 2-D]
Busted and blue

Carnival

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a

[Chorus 1: Anthony Hamilton]
Just like a carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing

We, just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around

Provocative
That's what I want

A cha-charger, everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger, what is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger, what do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger, what did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Chorus: 2-D & Grace Jones]
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger

[Interlude: Grace Jones]
Okay
Yeah, okay

A cha-charger, everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger, what is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger, what do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger, what did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Chorus: 2-D & Grace Jones]
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger

[Bridge: Grace Jones]
I am the ghost
I am the sword
I am the ghost

[Verse: 2-D & Grace Jones]
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting from
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What do you say now?
Thought you could teach us as the flowers have grown
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Chorus: Grace Jones & 2-D]
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
I'm inside you
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm in charge
(A cha-charger)
No antennas

[Verse 1: Peven Everett]
I, I wait
What ya gotta say now?
When I pick you out, baby
What ya gotta say now?
You're coming on to me, just
We're going to religion
Like water, we're moving, baby
And we're running through life's cycles
This is the ego shaking
We need to escalate it
We're only halfway to the lover waiting

[Refrain: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
Halfway, halfway to the halfway house
We're not takers

[Verse 2: Peven Everett]
We're feeling the same chill
It's giving momentum
We're feeling the same thrill
Whatever we do, trust
Imagine a broadcast, the central in mountain
You say that you want your cherryade fountain

[Chorus: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
Cherry (Cherry)
Cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found mercy (I found mercy)

[Bridge: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
Play piano, I'll sing mercy
Cherry-ch-ch-ch-cherry, baby
Cherry, cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found mercy (I found mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)
Swim in the light!
(Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)
Gotta get out!
(Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)

[Chorus: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
Cherry (Cherry)
Cherryade fountain
(Cherryade fountain)
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found, I found, I found mercy baby
I found
Cherry, cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found
I found mercy (I found mercy)

[Outro: Peven Everett]
Do that, G
I found mercy

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Mama Mavis, oh, Mama, they tried my patience
{Obama} is gone, who is left to save us?
{Orlando,} we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbors
They say the devil's at work and {Trump} is calling favors
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Refrain: 2-D]
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change coming
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change, oh, change is coming
You'd best be ready

[Outro: Mavis Staples]
Be ready, ready for it
Be ready, be ready
(Let me out)

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

[Post-Chorus: 2-D & Azekel & Posdnuos]
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white, dirty
Moments
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white dirty
Moments
Shiver down my backbone

[Verse: Posdnuos]
De La is also back again (Uh-huh)
With a crew that's bound to pack 'em in (Uh-huh)
Got a girl who's up for the matin'
I sense the need in her grammar
Her nose has never been skatin' (Uh-huh)
But she's sippin' star constellation (Shit)
For real, her squirt game was so like 2Pac out of court run towards camera (Uh-huh)
My response to that was just, "Check please"
Fuck that, my man, you can't let these (Moments)
Pass you by like "tick tock"
So I'm smackin' the bottom like flip flops
Made her alarm ring (She screams)
And now we done, we passed the test
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

[Post-Chorus: 2-D & Azekel & Posdnuos]
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white, dirty
Moments
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white dirty
Moments
Shiver down my backbone

[Bridge: Noodle & Posdnuos]
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments
Moments

[Outro: Ben Mendelsohn]
I'm talkin' about the Kool Klown Klan
Kool Klown Klan
I'm talkin' about the Kool Klown Klan
I need to step out for a fresh of breath air after that

[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first, a word of instruction

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor (drop)
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more (drop)
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

[Chorus: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright

[Verse 2: Kilo Kish]
Okay, slide like a lizard, walk like a crab
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're invisible, you melt into a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

[Chorus: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
Who knows?
There's always stains on what's real and true
Tonight is a special, special occasion
And all that's left for us to do, is move

[Bridge: Imani Vonshà]
Ooh, I, I
Where am I going?
What am I doing?
I, I'm alive
Alive
I can fly
I, I'm so alive
I'm so, I'm so high

[Verse 3: 2-D & (Zebra Katz)]
(Everybody)
Everybody says I'm busted and blue
I feel better when I don't need that
Everybody gonna funk the night
It's so big, big, big
Everybody says that I'm more
Feelin' out of body, I'm drinkin' it up
Can I tell you what the dream's about tonight?
(Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright)

[Chorus 2: 2-D & Popcaan]
All my life

All my life
Saturn's about to make love and I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in 'cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal day

[Bridge: 2-D & Popcaan]
With the holograms beside me, I'll dance alone tonight
In a mirrored world, are you beside me
All my life?
Distortion

[Chorus 2: 2-D & Popcaan]
All my life
I'm in the stakin' bar, I got debts, I'm a debaser
All my life
Saturnz about to make love and I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in 'cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breakin' are makin' you a personal day

[Chorus: 2-D]
I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities

[Verse 1: Jamie Principle]
I'm caught up in this
I'm caught up in this murder
I'm trying to get away, but
I'm trapped in this phase
I'm caught up in this masquerade

[Chorus: 2-D]
I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities

[Verse 2: Zebra Katz]
You always said
I was out of control
Teach me hatred
Then let me go
You didn't care, no truth and no dare
In the bathroom, blow everywhere
Now you're so high, kiss all the guys
Making me jealous, I wonder why

[Chorus: 2-D]
I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas
Of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas
Of your priorities

[Verse 1: 2-D]
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (She's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover (She's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

[Verse 2: 2-D]
She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar (She's my collar)
Nothing to be justified yet
She the first I'm running with
She the one that get my collar
She the one I'm running with (She's my collar)

[Chorus: 2-D]
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis & 2-D]
I'm yellow, he was blue
It's nothing that he could hide
We made a green meadow
Whenever we would collide (She's my collar)
I died a thousand times
I did what I had to do
Hey, that's just how it goes
I'm still coming back to you

[Verse 1: 2-D & Kali Uchis]
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her (You, you, you)
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her (You, you, you, you)
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (She's my collar)
I don't take her number just don't think I'd call her (You, you, you)
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty (You, you, you, you)
I clear my system, I don't need no other (You, you, you)
This is my persona, secret lover (She's my collar)

[Chorus: 2-D]
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar
Oh, she's my collar

[Verse 1: Peven Everett]
Momentary pain can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change; magic lantern strings
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it ends?

[Verse 2: Peven Everett]
Girl, your life will turn, just like a strobe
'Cause your daddy's vain, and your mother won't
And your heart engages into heartless throes
Are we obsidian? Is this how it goes?

[Chorus: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
If when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light

[Verse 3: Peven Everett]
Slide the light off you, you may find some peace
All will come to you, if you come with me
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it is? Yeah

[Chorus: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
If when your private life is dreaming (When your pri-)
You're living the strobe light (Oh, living the strobe light)
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light
{unintelligible vocals}

[Bridge: Peven Everett]

[Chorus: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
And when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
(You're living the strobe, when your private life is dreaming)
And you will find the life you're needing
(You'll find the life you're needing)
You're living the strobe light
And when your private life is dreaming
(When your private life is dreaming)
You're living the strobe light
(Living the strobe, you're living the strobe)
And you will find the life you're needing
(You will find the life you're needing, yeah yeah yeah)
You're living the strobe light

[Outro: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
And when you're private
And then you're dreaming
(You're living the strobe light)
You hit the light
When your private life is dreaming
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(Like you need it)
(You're living the strobe light)
You're living the strobe light
You hit the light
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
When your private life is
And when you're private
Dreaming
And then you're dreaming
(You living the strobe light)
You hit the light
You're living the, living the
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(You're living the strobe light)
You hit the light
You're living the strobe light

[Verse 1: Kelela]
Don't try to hide away
You know you've been on
Though I'm keeping calm, I'm not on
Go away, my love
Thought I could change our fate
I tried again, but this delay
It's more than I can take

[Chorus: Kelela]
And it got to me
When you state your love
And you walk away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
I will be full-on
If it's up to me
It's all I got

[Verse 2: Kelela]
Feels so good doing me
If you take a look at the time you took and move on
But don't go too far, my lover
We could try harder, baby
There's gotta be a better way
So much that we could make it

[Chorus: Kelela]
And it got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
Gotta be full-on
It is up to me
It's all I got

[Interlude: Kelela & 2-D]
It's all I got
It's all I got
It's all I got

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Wish I could think of better ways
'Cause I lost my patience yesterday
If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times, I feel like givin' up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losin' faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't contend with no handlin'
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, cryin' for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusin' power
Clock is tickin', hour after hour
Makes me wanna throw my hands and holler

[Chorus: Kelela]
And you got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
Gotta be full-on
It is up to me

[Verse 1: Rag'n'Bone Man & 2-D]
You can be mad at me, tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
Or you could just freak with me
Said it again, let the numbers roll
I hear that about you, baby (Hear that about you)
It's back when the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that (Don't ever look)
It's just in the daylight, no
It's just in the daylight, no

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)
(I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

[Verse 2: RAY BLK & 2-D]
Why are you mad at me? Tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
You should just freak with me, freak with me
And let the numbers roll
I'm here by the fire, I'm waitin' (Hear that about you)
Back where the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that (Don't ever look)
It's just in the days I've known
It's just in the days I've known

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man, RAY BLK & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

[Verse 3: Zebra Katz]
Yo, new black king, New York dream
Tell these motherfuckers everything I'm seeing
My world's darker than the young black dream
Of the first black prince of a new white king (Oh, oh)
I just wanna play, have it my way
Make a bunch of fucking rules, then tell 'em obey (Ooh)
They can't fuck with me, yeah, yeah, Ojay (Yeah)
First name, government? No, him, I slay (Slay)
New black king, oh
New black king, yeah
New black king, oh
Uh, obey, obey, obey

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man, RAY BLK & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

[Outro: RAY BLK & 2-D]
(Mirror)
I'm a broken screen
(I am a mirror)
And I'm over it
(I am a mirror)

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Is it resolution?
Or black and white flying balloons?
Floating off, too colourful
Or is it separation
You put it to your counting sand
Waiting for the world to start again?

[Chorus: 2-D]
Ticker tape
Ticker tape
Tick-tick-ticker tape

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Is this how you're feeling?
Falling with the world tonight
Cauterized and beautiful
Slide the light
Is this how you're healing?
Out there in the paradigm
Waiting for a cavalcade to come again

[Chorus: 2-D]
Ticker tape
Ticker tape
Tick-tick-ticker tape
Ticker tape

[Bridge: Carly Simon & 2-D]
Black light glints with colour
Sudden long and horizontal outlines the star
A sudden draft and quick chill
A single snowflake falls
And that is all
That is all
The world's face hidden under folding wing
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world to start again
Waiting for the world... again

[Outro: Kali Uchis]
'Cause we're working through it
Working through your nightmare
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift
And I'm working through it
Working through the nightmare
Watch the worker bees
As they're working for it
Working through the night shift

[2D]
Are you leaving for the rest of it?
Coming back to ghosts inside
Or is it just too late for that?
And I'm hoping for a little juice

[Chorus]
We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

[Verse 1: Jehnny Beth & 2-D]
And, we dream of home, I dream of life out of here
Their dreams are small, my dreams don't know fear (I got all you)
I got my heart full of hope, I will change everything
No matter what I'm told how impossible it seems (We got the power)
We did it before and we'll do it again
We're indestructible, even when we're tired
And we've been here before, just you and I
Don't try to rescue me, I don't need to be rescued

[Chorus: 2-D & Jehnny Beth]
We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power for that
We got the power to do that

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Get yourself up to the silent altar and call me
But don't forget the machines
'Cause if your choice is chipping it down on the M1
Then you'll wake up in the morning
You'll be storming, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
We got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens
We've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We got the power to do that

[Outro: 2-D]
We got the power
You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yes yes yes yes yes
(x 4)

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you
Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop

Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!

Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name

I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!
(all my DC's fans!)
(yea yea yea yea, yea yea yea yea)

Ladies leave yo man at home(3x)
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce
Twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake
Work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist
You better dip that thing

Cameron D. and Destiny

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'
I bought it
The house I live in
I bought it
The car I'm driving
I bought it
Cause I depend on me
(I depend on me)

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyoncé, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this! (WHOO!)

I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this jelly
I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!

Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold 9 million

I'm a survivor (What?)
I'm not gon give up
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor!!

[Verse 1]
I hope it sound good cause I'm in your hood
Big Snoop D-O-dub and I do it so good
I do it fly and I do it so fresh
Don't even trip off the mic cause ya know I'm the best
You ain't gotta judge shit, just kick back
And watch Snoop Dogg grab the mic and rap
I closed my eyes and turned down the light
And spit some shit that's like way tight
Ya never heard a nigga from the L.B.C
Come to pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop Paree
And then do it for you so smooth
To make you muthafuckas jump up and just groove
I got something to prove, I don't lose
When I'm on stage I be draped in blues
They call me the S, so yes ya choose...
The number one rapper cause I love to cruise

[Hook]
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware

[Verse 2]
I make the people just scream and they ooze
They never heard a nigga bring so many blues
I got the rhyme that'll make ya confused
It's Snoop D-O-dub I don't know how to lose
I just win and time and time again...
I blaze up the muthafuckin' chronic with my friends
I'm driving through the streets of papa Paree
And muthafuckas afraid to see me...
Do it on my own cause they know I'm head grown
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I got my hand on my bone
I better keep my hand on my chrome
Cause I ain't home
I don't what these muthafuckas do in they zone
They might try to catch me slippin'
But I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm known for crippin'
I'm known for trippin', I'm known for rippin'
I'm known for whippin' cause I'm so damn different

[Hook]
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware
Royal, royal, royal ware, royal ware

You already know who the fuck it is man, Taylor

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, smoke Kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain't no contest
Diamonds all in my Rolex, cuz' I go hard like P90X
See you dudes copyin' our moves, now you follow in our steps
Lil' kids just in the mirror, all insecure just trying to flex
Speakin' of Flex, shout out to Flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest, now try the best
Gangsters, trippy niggas all here
With me nigga, my weed, so strong
My Brain, so gone, Ooh
Outer space, solar, ooh
My Chain, polar, ooh
My bank, so long, ooh
Like I was playing poker ooh (poke-her ooh)
My face on the tele, so fuck what they tell me (what they tell me)
I always keep it real cuz' the people love the real me
They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA
Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed

[Bridge1: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

[Bridge 2: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've never been this high before, levitate rise off the floor
Elevate, get high some more, drift with the wind to the sky I soar
Like a bird, like a bird
I feel like I'm floatin' through fantasy island in the brain, up in the plane lost
My vision, is simply not in good condition, did I mention
We go hard, and we don't even leave home at all
So what a nigga doin', we ball, ball, so carry on
The Mary and the Molly clearly got me very cloudy
So I sit back with my mind in the zone, mindin' my own
Need nobody, I can get high on my own
You're on the late flight,my flight is already gone
I'm in the sky you ain't even left home
I black out my mind and I feel free to be, whoever the hell I may wanna be...

[Chorus: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see (so I can see)
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets
Signed Eminem, he's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E

[Hook: Snoop Dogg + (Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
Still hittin' them corners in them lo-lo's, girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
Distant solar systems and all the minor planets
Know nothing of our satellites and 747s
Fireworks that recreate the birth of constellations
Dying suns that laugh at shotgun powder imitations

When I am a sailor, and the sky, a pitch-black ocean
I'll look down at my bleeding heart and wish I were a Vulcan

It's Byzantine structures, churches and all
All of our treasure of oil and gold
All of the empires crumble in stone
Great architecture gilded in chrome

God and I, we correspond with intermittent letters
I send postcards from the road, and now and then he answers
Echoes northern city-states, and all the mighty kingdoms
Head of sewing needles on an unending horizon

I knew the words you sing before you
Ever thought to sing them
You call yourself a bastard
And I love you like an orphan
'Cause great men of science and literature
Don't impress me, what can I offer?
Because I am a chisel in your hand
Screaming at marble from a microphone stand

[Intro: DJ Paul]
You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

[Chorus: Drake]
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way

[Intro: Moodymann]
Hold on, hold on, fuck that
Fuck that shit
Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute
Fuck that shit
Still on this mothafuckin’ record
I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all
Ayy, y’all get some more drinks goin' on
I'll sound a whole lot better

[Verse 1]
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can’t blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

[Outro: Zoë Kravitz]
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say

[Refrain: Jorja Smith]
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I'm sure
They'll know you're trying to help 'em

[Verse: Drake]
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah

[Refrain: Jorja Smith]
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know, they'll know

[Outro: Drake]
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Verse 1]
God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, He knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Verse 2]
People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Outro]
You put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wasteman

Top story
Wah?

[Intro]
Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? I've had too many
This Virginia done me off already
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Verse 1]
'Cause I know what I like
I know how I wanna live my life
I don't need no advice
You're not here and we both know why
So, move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go crazy

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Verse 2]
I know we can't keep it together forever
'Cause you're crazy sometimes
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go—, look just

[Chorus]
Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Lionel Richie]
Together forever
Good morning, good afternoon, good night!
I'm here to talk about More Life
One second
Part I

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah
(Crowd Talking)

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don’t know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

[Verse 2: Drake]
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already
Tell you what's not yours
Tell you what's not yours

Part II

[Verse 3: Drake]
Six months since I've been back in the Six
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

[Verse 4: Drake]
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

[Bridge: Drake]
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
R. Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down

[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Outro: 600 Breezy]
This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we’ll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I’m sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit

[Refrain]
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up

[Chorus]
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew

[Verse]
I know I fear trust
I know I fear fear too much
On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates

[Refrain]
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
(Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Ah)
Hermès link, ice-blue mink (Woo!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is (Yah!)
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Yeah, October Firm in the cut (Yah!)
Stay at the top like I'm stuck, that's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax (Ha! Ha! Ha!)
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack (Yah!)
Virginia Black (Doo! Doo!)
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts (Facts, nigga, yah!)
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back (Blah!)

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Hermès link (Woo! Woo!), ice-blue mink (Yah!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture (Yah!)
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—

[Verse 2: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now (Right now)
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out (Ha!)
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note (Woo!)
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)
I got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through (Yah!)
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

[Chorus: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Hermès link, ice-blue mink (Yah!)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone (Gone, blah!), wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga (Woo! Woo!)
Yah!

[Background: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary
More Life

[Chorus: Skepta]
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (Mm)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Yeah)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Dubplate special)
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK, greaze!)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish

[Verse 1: Skepta]
You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (Shing!)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud nine, a man's extra cozy (Bo!) (Greaze!)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly (Bo!)
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy (Greaze!)
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade (Sex)
Red umbrella when I make it rain (Sex)
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same (Greaze!)
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans (Yeah)

[Chorus: Skepta]
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (More Life)
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish (OVO, BBK)
Check my account, that's a madness (Dubplate)
Check my account, that's a madness (Street team)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Greaze!)
Block that account, it's a catfish

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision (Mmm)
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision (Straight)
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
(Greaze!) So don't forget to remember me (Yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (Get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me? (Bo-bo)
(Greaze!) Taliban, Halloween (Icy)
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (Greaze!) (Bo-bo)
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine (Jeez!)
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene

[Chorus: Skepta]
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish

[Intro: Drake & Baka Not Nice]
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt
Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (Ugh)
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves (Trappin')
Gangland with the right hand (Gang)
Undertaker with the tattoos (Tats)
Never listen to the class rules (No)
Switch it up, they bit the last move (Let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (Magnet)
You got the goin' out sad bitches (Sad)
I spent a fifty on the chain (Racks)
You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)
You got the key to defeat (Defeated)
I got the keys to the warzone (Brrapt)
You got the key to the peace (Ugh)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (Yeah, yeah)
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (Yeah, yeah)
Gettin' loose (Yeah) off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose (Yeah)
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool (Yeah, in my pool)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room (Yeah, in my room)
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!" (Yeah)
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs (Yeah)
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)
God, the way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest (Straight up)
I guess for the fuck shit, I'm biased (Yeah)
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my mama out the basement (Mama)
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B up out the bracelets (Yeah, yeah)
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes

[Verse 1:  Drake]
Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, "I know you need a break."
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music" so I woke up with my wood hard

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I was stealin' from a bitch (Slime)
Back when I was 21 (Facts)
My favorite gun was a SIG (Nine)
20 in the clip, head one (No cockin')
Growin' up, I was a running back
You never made me ran once (Goddamn)
I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Hunt (Ketchup)
I'm kickin', pimpin' like I punt (Beat it)
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, deer meat (Ooh)
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep (Like he sleep)
We ain't doin' too much talkin' (Nah)
I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech (Election)
Like the President, I kill 'em neat (Scammers)
I’m talkin' neat like freak
I'm talkin' neat like fleek
I'm talkin' neat like a geek (Yeah!)
You come with beef, I eat a B
I'm talkin' B’s, spellin' bee (Sheesh)
Double R, that's a Rolls
Paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' rolls like a belly (Woo)
Like a new car, I got two keys
Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat (Chevy seat)
Then I heard they been pullin' all week (All week)
I'ma use your name like, "Who is he?"
You get it? Haha!
I said I'ma use a name like, "Who is he?"
Got some gold on, leprechaun, sheesh
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty (Woo)
I’m talkin' PADI—I meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets (Pellet)
I watch the game from the floor (Floor seats)
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress
I'm talkin' wood, pants down (Pants down)
I'm talkin' woods like them clowns (You get it?)
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji (Hrr)
All your diamonds partly sunny
I'm talkin' sunny like D, Sunny (Sunny Delight)
My diamonds wet, it cost me money
I'm talkin' wet like it's runnin' (Sink)
I'm talkin' wet like Katrina (New Orleans)
I'm talkin' wet like Dasani, huh

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Outro: Dave]
Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Drake]
(Watch out) Watch out
Why, nigga? (The cops out) Cops out
(It's all love when I ride top down) Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 5: Drake]
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

[Chorus: Drake]
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

[Verse 7: Drake]
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

[Outro: Earth, Wind & Fire]
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on?
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Aww, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy, but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know; first, you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen, we with everything
I went off in the '16, give me '17

[Chorus: Drake]
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

[Chorus: Drake]
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything

[Verse 3: Drake]
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three-face, damn
Ol' triple-double-Russ face, watch-with-the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die, and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.

[Intro: Young Thug]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Feel a rump-rump

He did a number on you (I know, brrrt)
That must be why you move so... icy

[Bridge: Drake]
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody you’d ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me (yeah)
Patient as can be, but

A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything, somehow

See you when I see the real thing, gettin' realer and realer (Real)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Drake]

More Life.
 
More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true
 
I've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
 
But if someone should come collecting

Sooner than we're all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you

— Drake

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wish I could go right back
Right back to the start of you and me
Try to get a picture of the woman that you saw
And give a piece of that to the girl that I've turned out to be

[Chorus]
Is that so impossible?
You made me what I am
Better or for worse
Blessing or a curse, it's you and me
And now I'm totally incomplete
Worry or defeat, if you stay or leave it's the same to me

[Verse 2]
Too close to your sun, I cast these shadows
Do you recognize me, when they fall across my face
And I've kept this secret from you terrified you'd know me
The unforgiven truth of who I am in the light of day

[Chorus]
Is this so impossible?
You made me what I am
Better or for worse
Blessing or a curse, it's you and me
And now I'm totally incomplete
Worry or defeat, if you stay or leave it's the same to me

[Verse 3]
Pick me up for the last time, baby
Never make you see me like this again
Believe me, I can make some beautiful promises
And in the morning wake up back in my head
Who says that one day it will be all perfect
Like love will somehow make a 7 mile
And maybe, just maybe that's the art of living
To be imperfect living on the ground
Maybe, just maybe that's the art of living
To be imperfect living on the ground, now

[Verse 1]
Out on the edge, feels like the middle
Like the middle of a prayer
Don't need a prayer, baby who's asking?
It's mercy when you calling me
Anywhere I go, somewhere this love's already seen
Here we are, a little lower than the angels
Higher than an afterglow
Dancing with the devils, asking where the time go
Dancing on the grave of all my beloved souls

[Bridge]
And if I seem a little careless
It's cause we burn a little brighter than the rest

[Chorus]
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
I'm not going out 'til the whole world's shouting like
Damn, that girl is crazy but I know what she's about
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
I'm not going out 'til the whole world's shouting back
Damn, this girl is crazy but it's me she's singing about
Oh, I don't need to be forgiven
Oh, the way I'm living

[Verse 2]
Hands up, everything is free now
Burning up, ashes on the ceiling cause
Cause I'm not leaving nothing
But a legend and a feeling for one person or a million
Just a lobby on the building

[Bridge]
And if I seem a little careless
It's cause I burn a little brighter than the rest

[Chorus]
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
Brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
I'm not going out 'til the whole world's shouting like
Damn, that girl is crazy but I know what she's about
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
Oh, brighter than we burn, brighter than we burn, brighter than
I'm not going out 'til the whole world's shouting like
Damn, this girl is crazy but it's me she's singing about
Oh, I don't need to be forgiven
Oh, the way I'm living

[Outro]
I'm not going out, going out, not going out
I'm not going out, going out, not going out
I'm not going out 'til the whole world's shouting like
I'm not going out 'til the whole world's shouting like
I'm not going out, going out, not going out
I'm not going out, going out, not going out
I'm not going out 'til the whole world shouting like
I'm not going out 'til the whole world shouting like

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I like big bitches cause they so large
Big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a slim nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause they say that I'm skinny and tall
But a big bitch gets shit that a nigga need
Always got the drink and somethin' on the weed
And I never have a muthafuckin' need no more
And every nigga that I know done fucked a fat-ass hoe, so

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
But, uh, I'm that nigga who gon' kick the reals
And, uh, big bitches this is how I feels
See ain't no reason for the Dogg to lie
I like it when they weigh about two-o-five
With all this shit goin' on nowadays
I'd rather have a big bitch cause she pays what she weighs

[Intro]
Hey
Screwed up
You look like a double cup stuffed ( yay!)
Don't do that babe , I love you
I love it

[Hook]
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , nooooo

[Verse: Dru Smith]
Don't never bitch come before mine
Double cup we go slow grind
If I'm doing time she gon write a nigga
Keep my books straight do the whole nine
She gon raise her right hand take her stand
Ride on her witness
I like to buy bags, spoil her feet
Have her flying in Fendi's
Keep it 1k, my bitch Ray Remler
Fell in love with her first day I hit her
Right all summer fuck her all winter
Took 'er to her momma' house, then I missed her
She a real nigga, had her ridin' with the killas
Let her head down when she ridin' with the smither
Don't trust these niggas told her ride with the pistol
We scrobbin' through we riddin' all silly

[Hook] x2
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , hell no no no oh hell no

[Verse 2: Squab]
I used to fuck this bad bitch
This bitch name was Trisha
She had a fat ass and that pussy was delicious
Now Trisha worked at the booty club
She had this one lil friend
Her friend name was Keisha, fat ass and waist thin
Keisha gave me that top
Real good chewin', did have no feelin's
Told her we can even get down on the floor if it ain't no silly
I fucked Keisha's best friend she was a bartender at the club

Got my dawg off the chain and I'm out here chasin' cat

[Hook] x2
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , hell no no no oh hell no
No ceilings

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Got me chillin', I left the girl fo' Philly because she gave me no sillies
I kept the girl chilli because she gave me no feelings
She had me numb, but I chilled on the soul
She know the dealin', now that I see her I know
She say I wanna kill her
She say her lil fume and how she couldn't heal 'im
I fucked all of her friends, now her friends
She wanna kill 'em
But it's only in her fuck, causee when we fuck
She used to tellin'
Especially this one bad bitch named Emilia
See I was sex limit, the fact it was like a million
And I ain't gon' lie, I liked her when she told me
But she shouldn't tell her
Cause she was like Wendy Williams

[Hook] x2
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Don’t never bitch come before mine
Noooo , hell no no no oh hell no
No ceilings

[Verse 1]
Oh lord, what's god got to do with fading circumstance
Forever or a one night stand
You can have faith or you can be a man
While we lay around
I can tell you where I stand

[Pre Chorus]
Oh, we are blind and I'm yours, but I know this for sure now
Oh, I'm no faithful servant no more
No more hands to the sky
No more knees on the floor

[Chorus]
All I owe you is my love
Still here for you if it's still enough
One thing is certain, the world don't need us
So forget what they say, it's not the same
We'll try again and I'll die that way

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, here again
The divine comedy with my favorite demons
Left my life somewhere at the bottom of these drinks and
I just payed tomorrow for what all I spent this weekend

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

All I owe you is my self
Every other person is just someone else
Give me your sins when they are giving you hell
I'll look the other way, God don't explain
Look at my face and let it fade

[Chorus]

Girl, don't stop, girl, don't stop
And she still keeps scratching me up
Leaving marks on my mind
Snatching me up
And she still keeps scratching me up
I'll take your pain if you take mine
And she still keeps scratching me up
Oh, babe, oh, babe
Got her nails digging in my flesh
And she still keeps scratching me up
Woah, yeah
Digging in my skin once again, oh
And she still keeps scratching me up
She can't stop, oh, oh
And she still keeps scratching me up
And she still keeps scratching me up
Oh, babe
And she still keeps scratching me up
And she still keeps scratching me up

It's 3AM, I'm back for more, yeah
Just two of us
Show me what I'm waiting for
One by one, one by one

I saw, I waited
I took time, yeah, I spend it
First time, in a minute
That I worked this hard, that I worked this hard
Thank God, that I did it
One time and I was in it, yeah
But one time ain't enough
I need some more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there ain't nothing better than you
Got me watching every move
Like you're the only one in the room
Ooh, baby, I can't help myself
And I don't know why but I can't stop thinking

One by one, one by one

[Chorus]
Girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause girl, your love is priceless
Flying in all the jets I flew, yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Verse 1]
I got more gold chains than these dope dealers (I look like I'm whippin')
And I can't relate to these broke niggas (I don't understand)
I pull out my driveway, only 12 cylinders (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Thank God it's a new day and I'm still killing 'em (uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But none of it don't matter, baby, no
If you ain't waiting there when I get home
'Cause I can't spend this money on my own
I need my queen to take her throne

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
Flying in all the jets I flew, yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Verse 2]
Been around the world, seen a lot of women (I seen 'em all)
That's how I know you one in 100 million (girl, you the one)
Everything that I wanted (I wanted), if I seen it, I bought it (I bought it)
Pockets jumping like Jordan right now (jumpin', jumpin', jumpin')

[Pre-Chorus]
But none of it don't matter, baby, no
If you ain't waiting there when I get home
'Cause I can't spend this money on my own
I need my queen to take her throne

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless (love is priceless)
Flying in all the jets I flew (I flew), yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Bridge]
I'd trade in the Wraith and buy you diamond rings (diamond rings)
Baby girl 'cause I know you like shiny things (shiny things)
Whatever you want, oh, you can have that (have that)
Pull up in the mall, oh baby, grab that (grab that)
These girls, they ain't got nothing on you at all (nothing, baby)
'Cause your love is too priceless, don't care what it cost, no no
'Cause money, it don't mean a thing, you know I got enough of it
What I'm tryna say is you can get it, anything you want from me
My baby, you worth all of that and more

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless (love is priceless)
Flying in all the jets I flew (I flew), yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Verse 1]
What are we doing alone?
Time standing still just waiting for this moment
What are we holding on for?
Hesitating, both our hearts are open
Why would you wanna leave? Don't you feel secure?
Rest assured, I got you covered
Got your back taken for
Go the distance, nothing shorter

[Chorus]
What are we here for?
What are we here for?
What are we here for?
Let's be an example right now
We don't wanna regret this
What are we here for?
Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh
What are we here for?

[Verse 2]
What are we doing alone staring up at the moon?
Know our night is waiting, oh yeah
Do you wanna go, do you wanna stay?
I see you contemplating
Why take a chance and drop the ball?
We got the world in our hands
If we're touching the sky, why would we land?
So you don't have to question, noo

[Chorus]
What are we here for?
Oh, what are we here for?
Oh, can you let me know?
What are we here for?
Let's be an example right now
We don't wanna regret this
What are we here for?
Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh
What are we here for?

[Bridge]
What are we doing alone staring up at the moon?
Know our night is waiting, oh yeah
Do you wanna go, or do you wanna stay?
I see you contemplating

[Chorus]
Oh, what are we here for?
Yeah, ooh, I-I-I, what are we here for?
I just wanna know
What are we here for?
What are we here for?
Let's be an example right now
We don't wanna regret this
What are we here for?
Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh
What are we here for?

Is it really picture perfect?
Yeah, picture perfect
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I, I, I apologize for the times that he hurt you
Realize it, you know he don't deserve you
If you were mine, girl, I'd show you what you're worth
Look in my eyes, I'm so on it, he acting like he don't want it
I've been lurking and waiting, that shit irking my patience
I'm a savage, but I'm just trying some different shit lately
I don't usually have to wait in line
What you doing to me? It's fucking with my mind
Goddamn, I gotta see your ass online
Girl, again and again
With that other guy, goddamn
I know how it seems, but can you tell me just one thing?

[Chorus]
Is it really picture perfect? (Is it really picture perfect?)
Does that nigga serve a purpose? (Does that nigga serve a purpose?)
Is it really even working? (Is it really even working?)
'Cause underneath the surface, I can tell you're hurting
Is it really picture perfect? Uh
You got a nigga working (Is it really picture perfect?)
Got me out here tryna earn it, earn it (picture perfect)
Well I'ma wait my turn then, 'cause I know he gon' burn it

I was tryna mind mine (yeah), staying off your timeline (yeah)

I don't know what to do, baby, wish I never met you
'Cause ever since you came through, I been doing things that I never do, oh
I'm here and I just need to know if you can feel everything that I feel
I feel, like that thing you got, it ain't for real

[Chorus]
Is it really picture perfect? (Is it really picture perfect?)
Does that nigga serve a purpose? (Does that nigga serve a purpose?)
Is it really even working? (Is it really even working?)
'Cause underneath the surface (underneath the surface), I can tell you're hurting (I can tell)

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want to break, I don't want to break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want to break, I don't want to break from love

[Verse 1]
You called me, I tried to shake the other night
In a hurry, guess you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme

[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love

[Verse 2]
This journey will have its ups and downs
Sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while
First degree burns don't leave scars
We can turn this pain around

[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when (way back when)
Your heart was spilling over without an end (without an end)
I hurt you once before I hurt you again (again and again)
You lost the faith that you had (yeah), had trusted in (trusted in)
So

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love
A break from love
A break from love
If fish swam out of the ocean and grew legs and they started
Walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking

And the stars fell out of the sky and my tears rolled into
The ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why you even set my world into
Motion

'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here then I don't wanna be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I looked up into the grey sky and see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around these golden beacons I see nothing but black

I feel a way of something beyond them
Don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation then most of my life isn't
Real

'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter

'Cause if you're not really here then I don't want to be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Oh

'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here then I don't wanna be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
If you're not really here then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way you prove you love them
Listen baby, hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
(I don’t know, I don’t know)
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me baby
So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me baby, yeah

Thank you
Woo…thank you so much
Alright

[Verse 1]
If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out my door
My love would over-rule my sense
And I'd call you back for more

[Chorus]
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man
My man
My man, yeah

[Verse 2]
She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall
'Cause you're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass, yes she does
But you keep begging her to love you
But me you won't ask

[Chorus]
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman

[Bridge]
Life is so crazy
Love is unkind
Because she was first, darling
Will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

[Outro]
If I was your, if I was your woman
If I was your woman
I gotta be, I gotta be your
(If I was your woman) Your woman
(If I was your woman) If I was your woman
(If I was your woman) Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never, never, never stop loving you

Thank you; thank you; thank you
That's a big shoutout to Miss Gladys Knight

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
And I must really like you
'Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time, no
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

[Chorus]
And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear
It feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)

[Verse 2]
Baby baby baby
I see us on our first date
You're doing everything that makes me smile, yeah
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
And ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh, baby baby baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild
And it feels like oooooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear it baby, it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Break

[Bridge]
"See, he don't know what he's doing to me
Got me feeling all type of crazy ways
Got me feeling like uh
Owww! Ooooo Oooooo"

I’m doing more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
‘Cause did I mention, you're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'

[Chorus]
‘Cause my lovin' feels like ooooooo
But you don't know my name
And I swear it feels like oooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
But you don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Ohhh

[Outro]
And it feels like oooooh
But you don't know my name
You don’t know it
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo
Oooo ooo oooo ooo ooo ooo
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)
Will you ever know it? My name…yeah…yeah…yeah
Thank you
Down where the trade winds play
Down where you lose the day
We found a new world
Where paradise starts we traded hearts
Way down where the trade winds play
Music was everywhere
Flowers were in her hair
Under an awning of silvery boughs we traded vows
The night that I sailed away
Oh, trade winds, what are vows that lovers make?
Oh, trade winds, are they only made to break?
When it is May again
I’ll sail away again
Though I am returning it won’t be the same
She traded her name
Way down where the trade winds play
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but, baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine
Where is the one
Who'll end the search I'm making
Where is the one
Who'll change my dream to waking
Behind some far off secret door
There's my love
There's my life
In store
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love
I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue

Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw
My flue has a flaw

From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose
It's not as sweet by the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flue
Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out

Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out
I used to walk with you
Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know
Would always smile "Hello"
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way
I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way
It isn't by chance I happen to be
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
"Come sit over here" somebody will call
"A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all"
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lyin' in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
"Come by for a drink, we're havin' a game"
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of 'em mine
But often my eyes see a different shine
Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young
Why was I born tell me why I am living
What do I give or what am I'm giving
What do I want anything I can not hope for
What can I hope for I wish I knew

Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you

Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Die-ie-ie-ie-ie, woah
Would you miss me?

[Chorus:  Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga, ayy
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga (Oh)
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga (Oh, oh)
I'm probably dead (Buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hear the gunshots sound, another black man down
'Nother innocent killed by the police, which side are you on?
All the violence is red and blue, oh
And the sons of a mother who never had a father
Tryna change a boy to a man
Got love for you, mama don't cry, we gon' be alright
'Cause one man shouldn't hate on another man
Judge no one 'cause of the color skin, oh-woah
Let's stop killing each other, it's genocide
And if I die before I wake
I just pray to God my soul to take, woah, yeah
If my brother is ridin', then we ridin', livin' like a young nigga

[Chorus:  Chris Brown & Nas]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga, ayy
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga (Oh)
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (Uh)
Ride or die as a young nigga (Oh, oh, uh)
I'm probably dead (Uh, buck, buck, buck)

[Verse 2: Nas]
In the projects it's made, so we don't progress
Experimental test, watch us kill each other
Film another homicide, they tape it, nobody make it
See, he goin' to kill the same lab rat he was raised with
Such and such, so and so, brother
They got right on top of each other
Too close, he got a new toast to shoot close
Gun go bang, talk your slang, basics
Soon the whole hood gon' have cases
See my neighbors, see my haters, see federal agents
Pharmacies ain't givin' out no medical favors
But we got scripts to codeine and Oxycontin
Gettin' rich off that like ain't no other options
Autopsy, dissect 'em, they open him up
All they wanna see is if he had coke in his blood
'Cause the cops shot him, just 'cause he came from the rock bottom
Now you see his name in the body column, they bodied him, uh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie (Oh, probably die)
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (Probably die)
Ride or die as a young nigga (Ayy)
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie (Hey)
‘Cause all of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga (We sippin' codeine)
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta
Ride or die as a young nigga (Oh, oh, hey)
I'm probably dead (Buck, buck, buck)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm living for my daughter
Ooh, ooh
‘Cause my baby need a father
Ooh, ooh
Don't wanna die young, young nigga, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You got my back, I'm rollin' with you
Ooh, ooh
Holding me down 'cause it's what we do, do, oh
(Probably die young)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we die-ie-ie-ie-ie (Die-ie-ie-ie-ie)
All of my niggas they came with the choppers
Ride or die as a young nigga (Ride or die as a young nigga)
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (Ayy)
Ride or die as a young nigga
I'ma be a legend when I go
If I die-ie-ie-ie-ie (Die-ie-ie-ie-ie)
All of my niggas they came with the choppers (Oh)
Ride or die as a young nigga
Codeine all up in the pineapple Fanta (Ooh)
Ride or die as a young nigga (Oh, oh, ooh)
I'm probably dead (Buck, buck, buck)

[Outro]
If I die, just look into the sky
I ain't even gon' lie, tell my niggas don't cry ‘bout nothin'
If there's somethin' on my mind, I was busy tryna find
I was drunk gettin' high

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
Chained to the beat now
Feelin' good, got good vibes
I can feel it in my feet now
Take a shot, baby loosen up
You're the star of the scene now
Went from readin' magazines to bein' on the cover
Get up in the groove now
Let me see you move now
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Lil Boat

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Take a shot, don't think about the hangover
You can get drunk, 'cause baby I'ma stay sober
Gon' hit the floor, let me see you move
You worked all week and studied hard in school
So let's have fun tonight (let's have fun)
You can take your hair up out the bun tonight
Fool with me, let me see you get pretty for the city
Put my hand on your ass so they know that you're with me
I'm talkin' super sadity
You with me, you with me, you with me, you with me, you with me
I love you, Katy!
Lil Boat!

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Skip Marley]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
Oh we're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Outro: Katy Perry]
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes
It goes on, and on, and on
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, it goes
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Ashes at ease now
Mother heart wise and swollen
How you purge for us

Notice the grief harden
I tear at the core
To serve the arbor

Unit of ours, of ours
A subtle harnessed rush like a dart
A hope for breath in there
Assuming it conquers ours

Unit of ours
Unit of ours
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Spent like four racks on a jacket
Fashion, put that hoe onto Fashion
My house is up like a king
Curbside with your bitch
Worldwide, I'm a trend
Take her all out, take her all out to Japan
Play with my dogs and we goin' off with your head
I'm lit like July the fourth
I'ma take off, run a nigga down like Jumanji
I serve him on 

[?]
I came out the crib like 

[?]
200 Miles on the dashboard (skrt, skrt, skrt)
Servin the 

[?]

[Intro: DJ Khaled]

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Once again I return
Most niggas ain't expect me back so soon
They put me in the mix, i had to up to pro-tunes
That's what I had to do
Too many dr. claw ass niggas
I had to call the go go gadget goons
I said it before, my niggas tight
I can call them tonight and have them put your head in the floor
My fans begging for more
White kids in my neighborhood like "wow dad his car looks way better than yours"
Woop, woop! Hit the button to open up the garage doors
Old schools pretty like the 

[?]
And im the new addition so bitch get in your seat 'fore i make them Backstreet Boys come after N'SYNC

[Interlude: DJ Khaled}
Yeah, man, that's the Pree Ringz
This the warning, man
This T-Pain AKA Gasoline
Light y'all niggas on fire

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
They say I walk around with NB on my chest
That's cause hoes walk around like NB is the best
NB is the truth
Man, I got government motherfuckers like "everybody down! TP's in the booth"

[Verse 1]
Hannah my darling
I will follow you into the sunrise under desert sky
We fly, rise together
With our hearts upon our sleeves for all to see
We two will breathe, aqua queen though vast distance between us
Heart sails with love for you

[Refrain]
I love you, I love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Verse 2]
Nakamarra sweet red earth will hold you
Like the strength you bless to me
True we engage humility, watch me struggle with your words
However truthful they may be
We'll see in time, opening our hearts
And nurturing our minds to shine

[Refrain]
I love you, love you, I love you I do...
Love you, I love you, I love you I do...

[Verse 3]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know, it sets our heart to fire
Sweeps you and I
Honey don't you know we too will pulse in through this light
Honey don't you know we too will pulse

[Refrain]
I'll always love you, love you, love you I do
Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Verse 1]

Love you, I love you, I love you I do

[Verse 3]
Oh, it sets our hearts to fire

Diamond of a boy
Docile and wide eyed
And small in size
Stay warm
Tranquil a hymn of vermillion
Prince minikid i feed you water and seed from my lips
Sleeps through the day
Drunk on the fruit of symmetry
Sleep in my hair, a nest, your labyrinth
Lapse of myth
I found a babe to keep warm and safe
I found a babe to keep warm and safe

[Verse 1]
In America, in America
I poured my sweat in America
This land is my land
It's America
I broke my back for America
All of money I make
All of these chances I take
Just paying my rent in America
Won't just stand around
Watch it go down
Won't just stand around
Watch it go down

[Chorus]
But maybe it's a long shot
Maybe it's a fantasy
We've given it all that we've got
Maybe we can live a dream
Oh, oh
Can we build a new life was it ever meant that we...
Could make it in America
Make it in America

[Verse 2]
In America, in America
They say I'm free in America
In America, in America
I still can't breath in America
Watch them squeezing my neck
Watch them bullets connect
We still gon' fight in America
Won't just stand around
Can't watch it go down
Won't just stand around
Watch it go down

[Chorus]
But maybe it's a long shot
Maybe it's a fantasy
We've given it all that we've got
Maybe we can live a dream
Oh, oh
Can we build a new life was it ever meant that we...
Could make it in America
Make it in America

[Bridge]
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America
We'll make it in America

Chickens looking at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this mother(what)

Trip quit talkin', crip walk if you down with yoself
Take a bullet with some grip and take this smoke on his jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap

Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

[Chorus]
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

[Chorus]
Don’t tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 2]
My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
"Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro"
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as "That King"
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

[Outro]
Let's get it!
Look, look!
On foenem

[Verse 1]
My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light
I'll be your sorceress, your heart's magician
I'm not a witch, I'm a love technician
I'll be you guiding light in your darkest hour
I'm gonna change your life, I'm like a poison flower

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a Mack Truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to... ooh

[Chorus]
Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes, don't be scared
Let's put the blindfolds on, let's see what's under there
I have a special chair, it has a special strap
And there's a special hook, it's called my special trap
Because you're bad, you're gonna get it good
Bow down to lick my boots
Because you know you should

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a Mack Truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to...

[Chorus]
Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love

[Verse 3]
We could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope
This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm gonna make you smile
I'll light the candles, 'til they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm gonna get you off

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a Mack Truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to...

[Chorus]
Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love
Love hurts, love hurts
Do you remember the time
Love hurts, love hurts
When we fell in love

[Verse 1]
I stepped in the dance
Looking for you
That's when
I felt you on my shoulder
The red light came on
And I knew it
Time to whine down
And find yourself a corner
Six pack with braids and green eye
I told myself
Girl damn he's too fly
His jeans fit just right
With the nice lean
Tell him upclose
Now let's sing the chorus

[Chorus]
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wind it slow, winding it slow now
If you like what you see
Then you have to let her know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe

[?] here we go, here we go now

[Verse 2]
I cannot front
I've been on you
The way that you move
Makes me light blue
If you keep talking like that in my ear
I'm about to put it on you I swear

[?] this basement
And go somewhere and kick it
It's getting crowded and it's hot
So tell me are you with it
But there will be no hitting
Wait hold up let me finish
I've got something for you

[Chorus]
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wind it slow, oh
If you like what you see
Then you have to let her know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe

[?] here we go, oh

[Bridge]
Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
And I'm going crazy
Now you're here
You can show me just how you do
Since last week
I've been waiting on you my love
I've been waiting on you
Now you're here
You can show me just how you do
How you do

[Chorus]
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wind it slow, you got to let me know
If you like what you see
Then you have to let her know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe

[?] here we go, here we go

[Chorus]
If you like what you see
Then you have to let me know
Put your hand pon it
And then we dip it low
Tip pon toe
Now it's time to wind it slow, you got to take your time
If you like what you see
Then you have to let her know
Put your hand on her back
And pull her in close
Tip pon toe

[?] here we go, oh

[Verse 1]
I rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more

[Chorus]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

[Chorus]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

[Chorus]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Outro]
Oh, oh
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye
I said excuse me baby
See girl I wanna get to know ya
Tonight, Your name
So please don't front on me, baby

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
That thing go raw
That thing go raw
That's what you like I know, I know
Afterparties in the Hills, while you poppin' whoa
That's how it goes
Well let's hit Miami, Biscayne
Might let you change your name for the night
Why, why, why?
So you can act a fool for the night
Oh that's right
Girl I know the tricks
Girl I know the tricks, ooh
But that happen to be the shit I like

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR and Bruno Mars]
Tell me why your panties still on
Girl when Ginuwine's playing in the background
I would never make a promise that I can't keep
I'm tryna tell it to you gently
We 'gone do more than kick it, like Jet Li
But you 'gone cum before I do don't stress me
Asking if it's you (is it you?), is it's me (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You say you want a good time
Well here I am, baby, here I am, baby
Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
If you want it, girl, come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me, baby, tell me, tell me, baby, what you tryna do?

[Chorus: Bruno Mars and PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
If you're gonna use it, you better abuse it
If you're gonna use it, you better abuse it
If you're gonna use it, you better abuse it
If you're gonna use it, you better abuse it

If I'm gonna know you, I gotta control you
If I'm gonna know you, I gotta control you
If I gotta know you, I gotta control you
If I'm gonna know you, I gotta control you

If you're not a punk, you're not alive
Your whole life has been a lie
Just sit back and die
I woke up Saturday
With the memory
Of a movie
Playing backwards
One I'd never seen
It was in a dream
So I walked to your house
I could tell you, but you're not home
Or you're sleeping
Maybe dreaming
The same thing
Your mom was cooking
In the kitchen
She was kissin'
Me all over my face
Is that okay?
I was okay

I wrote you a letter in the back of your basement
Written in blood so thick you could taste it
Seeping through the pages
Fluid from my veins and
Thoughts from my head
Make words in your basement
I'm getting sicker
Yeah, my filters getting thinner
I am saying
What I really mean
I am sorry
Not really
I woke up Sunday
I was buried
In the woods
Behind my house
I was choking on an insect
It reminds me
Back in your old house
Where you're lonely
Where you're pretty
Where you love me
Where they touch me
That's where I spit
On everything

I wrote you a letter in the back of your basement
Written in blood so thick you could taste it
Seeping through the pages
Fluid from my veins and
Thoughts from my head
Make words in your basement
I love your band
You're so angry
You're so angry
You are trying
To tell me
But I'm not here
I'm not anywhere

[B.o.B]

Niggas know who we are
Cause we come from the bottom
And we long to run this man
My nigga you gotta understand
That we are on the blocks where the cops is said
Hustling all the day
For that hundred grand
Homie wish you gotta understand, understand

[Verse: B.o.B]
Understand that we come from the bottom
And when you at the bottom, you gotta grind hard
Just to move it up a little, but you still at the bottom
And everybody got them, what I’m talking ‘bout is problems
Yeah, in the struggle you can end up with a daughter
Or end up with a wife, or one-night-stand, it ended up being your life
So now you got some kids, now you got a car, and now you got a crib
Yeah, I know it’s kinda fucked up, but that’s just the way it is, so you won’t lock up
Everybody tryna play the lotto, put their box up
But it just ain’t enough tough luck, next book, next story
Next page, next cypher, and it just continues
Remember what I said man, this the new millennium
Yeah, kinda seem fucked up, everybody in condominiums
Why you living on minimum wage
Working at a place, where you gotta bag groceries all day
Working all you fingers to the bone, then you goin’ home
Dogs barkin’ at him, but you can’t throw ‘em a bone
Argue with your boss but he won’t throw you a bonus
So you headed to the bank and tryna go and get a loan, but you can’t
So now you’re all alone, sippin’ on Coronas, man I know it’s all wrong
But that’s just the way it is, fucked up, ain’t it?
Spend your whole life strugglin’ to make 

[?]
But you can’t pay ‘em, so yeah,

Now you got bills all the way up to your neck
And that’s just a cycle

[Hook]
Niggas know who we are

[Intro: Snoop]
Through the agony of defeat... and the thrill of victory
Some fall, but only one remains standing
I'm the last man standing
I'm the last man standing

[Verse 1: Snoop]
Wait, I'm thinkin' of plottin'
Tryna get my life together
Cause if I don't get it right
I might lose my life
I'm seeing so many killed
My niggas get popped, then dropped
On the streets for nothin', don't stop
Can't stop, won't stop, never ever will
I'm tellin' y'all, I'm tired of my peoples gettin' killed
For real, what we gon' do to make it better
We gotsta say som', let's write a big letter
To the folks up top, politicians on a mission
Cause they wishin' but they stoppin'
And they really ain't doin' nothin' at all
And Doggy Dogg is upset
I'm the last man standing cause I'm a rap vet
Takin' bullets, duckin' bullets, dodgin' bullets
Tryna find a way to get out, don't pull it
Too quick and too fast, slow down
Cause ya might have to meet me at twelve, at the throwdown
The showdown, woah down
Uh nah, last man standing and I'm down for the cause
All in all, the last man standing

[Hook: Snoop]
Seem to be gettin' crazy everywhere
It's gettin' crazy outside
It's gettin' crazy inside
It's gettin' crazy everywhere
Even over there

[Verse 2: Snoop]
Now, niggas didn't think that gangbangin' would spread down to Little Rock Arkansas
But indeed, it don't stop like I told you from the gettin'
Gangbangin' is everywhere, it's in everybody's city
Can't hide it, can't cover it up
Can't put no rug on top of it cause you can't stop it
You love it, niggas love it, white boys love it too now
Cause you know, hey, to have a gun is the thang now
But you know, you gotsta wake up and realize
Cause if you don't, you'll push a heater and push yourself in the trunk
You ridin' up the block thinkin' you bad
Thinkin' you tough, nigga I had enough
Stuck, so many niggas gettin' shot and popped and dropped
Stopped in their tracks, no comin' back
Face the truth, I'm the last man standing cause I know what I'm doin'
Takin' time and I'm planning

[Hook 2: Snoop]
I'm standing on my own two feet
Reachin' out to y'all cause I'm takin' y'all back to the streets
Where it all began
Standing on my own two feet and I'm the last man
Hmm, it's gettin' crazy everywhere, even in yo town
Thought gangbangin' was a West Coast thang, but you wrong
Gangbangin' is here to stay like motherfuckin' songs

[Verse 3: Snoop]
Man, it's gettin' deeper
I got two baby boys and I can't play them brothers cheaper
Cause if I don't teach 'em or give 'em somethin' to grow on
They might not be able to go on
It's wrong, nah it's right to see me stand on the mic
And give you people somethin' meditate, and take ya life...
To the next stage, or the next page
Ya gotsta get yours, I mean get paid
But it ain't nothin' like bein' down for yourself, and down for that real
Stop tryna peel, niggas' caps, make snaps, make raps or do whatever you gotsta do
Just rock for you and you
And don't stop until ya gets what ya gotsta get
Until then, just keep rockin' this funky shit
Cause I'm the last man standing
Demanding your attention, I'm on a mission

[Outro: Snoop]
Last man standing
I'm the last man standing
I'm the last man standing
The last man standing
I wanna say peace to all my homeboys that rest in peace
All the fallen soldiers
I'm the last man standing
Keep it real out here for y'all
Ya know, they tryna knock me down
Someone gotta stay out here and do it
Ya feel me?
My nigga Mark on the beat, last man standing

[Hook]
I got my nine in my pocket and I'm ready to bust
And if it came down to it I wouldn't (give a fuck)
About these bitch-ass niggas, I just don't (give a fuck)
About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
I got my nine in my pocket and I'm ready to bust
And if it came down to it I wouldn't (give a fuck)
About these bitch-ass niggas, I just don't (give a fuck)
About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
About y'all

[Verse 1: Snoop]
Yeah, who smokin'? who drankin'? who fuckin'?
Cause, it really ain't about nothin'
Push the button if ya down with the PG
My nigga Fly did this beat, this shit is greasy
He holla'd at me about turnin' this mutha out
Met a nigga in Chi-town at the Bishop house
No doubt, Midwest Side, with the nutty East Side
Had no other choice but to make it rizz-zide
Now I gotta slizz-zide, bizz-ack up in traffic
I got the boombastic, hit you off with a classic
Terrifically, police doggs be sniffin' me
That's probably why I catch a private jet like frequently
This is ineek-quity, nah it's inequity
That's when you put your money down on some property
And get ya chips right, and move like monopoly
And do this shit properly, ain't none of y'all stoppin' me

[Verse 2: Guerilla Black]
Uh-huh, yuh
Caucasians say I'm so amazin'
But all the niggas be like "that ain't Nathan"
Hell, you dealin' with a monster
Talk shit, I'll hunt ya
Like a predator, I kill all competitors
Nothin' does a body more better than ten shots
Break his bones with the bat, wrap him in glad lock
Find a stash spot where the smell don't seep through
Or alibi the titty bar, the girls well see through
Come near, see how I drop chips on the Buccaneers
I know you hate us, heart broke up like the Raiders
Up in San Diego, I got the ticket high
Cause I got to fly way up in Waco
Peruvian yayo, freshly imported
Take a tool, burn ya nose off like 

[?] nigga

[Hook]
I got my nine in my pocket and I'm ready to bust
And if it came down to it I wouldn't (give a fuck)
About these bitch-ass niggas, I just don't (give a fuck)
About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
I got my nine in my pocket and I'm ready to bust
And if it came down to it I wouldn't (give a fuck)
About these bitch-ass niggas, I just don't (give a fuck)
About these trick-ass hoes, I just don't (give a fuck)
About y'all

[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

[Video Outro]

[Verse 1]
Working my way up that ladder of success
Never knew how high to climb
Lost my footing time and time again
Never gave up, no I never stopped trying

Never sure what lies ahead of me
Can't keep myself from looking behind
Hard to believe in anything
When you're down or looking way up high

[Chorus 1]
I believe in the devil, yeah, I see him all the time
Every morning in the mirror like he's looking me in the eyes
And I would play my part, but I realize
That I'm always running short or running out on someone else's time

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I wish one day that I could walk straight through hell
And ask for all those wishes back
And in my twisted parody of self
I'd get a rush from all the things that I lack

I had that feeling just the other day
Something left me down and turn around
Hard to believe in an easier way
When every road I take keeps leading me down

[Chorus 2]
But I believe in heaven, yeah, I see it all the time
In the face of a stranger like it's looking me in the eyes
And I would play until the bottom of the curtain bends
But every solid beginning needs a solid end

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm riding high on the crest of tonight
Slowly I'm surfing down
Floating along like a leaf in the sky
Nothing to tear me down

[Chorus 1]
She's talking about the boy but I can barely hear it
And once I can't avoid, she's speaking to my spirit
Before I disappear, turn my head to hear she's saying he's reckless

[Verse 2]
Like to pretend that I do the best that I can
Hands high, I'm on the ground
Running around like I got time on my hands
But time's only slowing down

[Chorus 2]
No point in trying if it's only gonna kill me
Happy with who I am and try to not feel guilty
Turn into someone else, couldn't help myself when I'm so reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
You should try to talk to me
You should try to walk with me
I could change your life, forever ever
You should try to walk to me
You should try to talk to me
You should try to change your life with a nigga like me
You should try to love on me
Bumbaclot god, I'ma make it alright
I seen her walk by and it caught my eye
That ass so super fat, oh my, my, my
Everybody outta her life, he oh so nice

[Chorus]
You the best thing of all times
Best thing of all times
You the best thing of all nights
Best thing in all skies
You the best thing on the flight

Yeah, you the best thing in my life right now
You the best thing in the sky right now
You the best thing riding by right now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You the best thing doin' it big right now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
You the best thing that I seen this year
Lookin' like a rose, pussy tight on these hoes
The Benz Wagon, G-Code, big tires and she roll
I take her far as she can go, worth a black card on the low, woah
Color purple for the winning circle, high off love with no threats
She was retail livin', and now she detail livin'
Take a walk in the park, and I'm like it don't matter
Sippin' on a nigga juice (Act), fly planes out from Cali (Act)
Maybe you should wyle out baby, you should back out
I see the park is full of rottweilers with ya raw dog, yeah
I see them they finna got off and they plottin' on my door
Smokin' on Tijuana send a pack out with no dough

[Chorus]
You the best thing of all times
Best thing of all times
You the best thing of all nights
Best thing in all skies
You the best thing on the flight
You the best thing on the flight

You the best thing doin' it big right now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
You the best thing in the night, yeah
You the best thing in the day, yeah
You the best thing when you slay, yeah
You the best thing when you sleep, yeah
Rock hard, with the ten cars, and the garage and a bed now
Wi-fi nigga, rock out, nigga rock god, 'til you dead now, wait
I heard you want some bread now (Racks), ayy
Wanna be young and rich, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout (Talkin' 'bout), ayy
Make a band do a dance, call it rack talk, ayy
I just heard a body gettin' shanked
They better let him outta jail
On big homie he a bitch
They gon' fuck him up for real
I'm a big dog, fuck a vet (Heh, heh)
Put the fours on Chevelles (Skrt, skrt)
I was takin' act, poppin' pills
Z06, wide wheels (Skrt)
Baby girl, ride with your man
I'ma take a ride with the wheel (Skrt)
I just wanna ride with Renzel
Save a nigga life outta bail
305 take the heat
I'ma rip any beat
I'ma do my rhyme with the sheet
It's 'bout the time, you can see

[Pre-Chorus]
You should try to walk to me
You should try to talk to me
You should try to change your life, with a nigga like me (Nigga like me)
You should try to love on me
Bumbaclot god, I'ma make it alright
I seen her walk by and it caught my eye
That ass so super fat, oh my, my, my
Everybody outta her life, he oh so nice

[Chorus]
You the best thing of all times
Best thing of all times

You the best thing riding by right now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You the best thing doin' it big right now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus: Bob Dylan]
If you’re travelin' to the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
See for me that her hair's hangin' down
It curls and falls all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hangin' down
That's the way I remember her best

[Verse 2: Bob Dylan]
If you go when the snowflakes fall
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & Bob Dylan]
If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say hello (Remember me) to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Outro: Johnny Cash & Bob Dylan]
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
She once was a true love of mine
(hook)
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but in a bag
The future is in a bag
I ain't happy, I'm in a bag
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm in a bag but not for long
The future is in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag

(verse 1)
Finally someone let me out of my bag
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm in a bag
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm in a bag
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all in a bag
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different bags
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' in a bag too
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're in a bag
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you in a bag
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go
(hook)
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but in a bag
The future is in a bag
I ain't happy, I'm in a bag
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm in a bag but not for long
The future is in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag

(verse 2)
The essence the basics
Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a bag
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see in a bag
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this bag enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me in a bag
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so baaaaaag remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is in a bag
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in a bag
(hook)
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but in a bag
The future is in a bag
I ain't happy, I'm in a bag
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm in a bag but not for long
My future is in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag

My future is in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
It's in a bag
My future
Ba da ba ba ba

Wanna get away

[Verse 2]
He used to masturbate
He only 21
He do it every day
He doesn't get much sun
But if your name was Danny
Every time he came
One day he'll be a man
And he might understand it

[Chorus]
Want to be ignored
Want to be ignored

Ba da ba ba ba

[?]
He doesn't feel a thing
He's tryna make that money
Money make everything
And if the feelin's right
Then maybe JD changed it up and disappeared
He might have read about it

Wanna be ignored

Wanna be ignored
When I'm out in the street
And when I'm with all my friends
I wanna be ignored

[Verse 1]
This the part where them broke niggas put they headdown
Ay, shawty in my section cause there's money on the ground
Shawty a pill popper, she got the Xans on her (she got 'em on her)
I swear to God, I'm gon' pull out the rod and she gon' put hands on it (Show me your hands)
She know what the move is, she know what to do with the two zips
She know what the groove is, she a pro she know what to do here
I'm in the locker room with the house mom trying to work out a new deal
She got some new girls, so I need some new deals
HUH
Baby tell me how you feel
Cause I took the red pill, and you took the blue pill
You smart - I got it on me, I got it on me
Never leave the house without it, I'm by myself but I'm never lonely
Oh my god, I got the cheese cheese macaroni
Cause I been working on my grind
But right now I'm fucking some pussy and ass, and so is my niggas

[Chorus]

Keep on talking that fuck shit and Ima spray that mac grrat-gat-gat-gat
I got bitches in the bushes across the street from your house right now
I got yo bitch in the house with a dick in her mouth right now
And it ain't even mine, it ain't even time for that

Now I know my pimp game strong, now correct me if I'm wrong
But my nigga handled that shit so well that he need a crown for that

Feel like wherever my birthplace the centre of earth
Get the symphony for me, cause death eventually coming but first
Victory coming
This shit a shiv to the stomach
I learn discipline first, then I learn to rebuttal
The weak niggas with premium
We get it in
Demons and spliffs, sleepless again
Spent my life on the road, my pee on the wind
Two feet on the concrete
Prepare trees for me bitch
Recently walls defeat, they speaking again
Drink 'til I fall then I'm decent again
I don't remember shit
Moms predicted this
In your city with the keys so the breeze blowing easy as shit
I'm intriguing
I just might leave with a bitch if I need her for one night
I don't do my love right or trust no dusty bitch
Enough for me to just pipe
Catch me on some other shit
Catch me on a weeknight looking like I'm getting beamed up to The Mothership underneath the streetlight
Heard the check cutting soft
Fucking with the three stripes
Heard you been fucking with the beat like

[Outro]
Nigga I said shouts to Knxwledge for the beat (slanging all through the eve right???)
If anybody made a movie out of my life
I wouldn't like it, but I'd watch it twice
If they halfway tried to do it right
There'd be forty screen writers workin' day and nite.

They'd need a research team from Uncle Sam
And go from David Allen Coe to Billy Graham
It would run ten days in the final cut
And that would mean leaving out the gossip smut.

And I do request for my children's sake
Don't ever let 'em do a new re-make
The thing I'm sayin' is, don't you see,
Don't make a movie 'bout me
Even for T.V.
Don't make a movie 'bout me.

Don't let 'em drag old Hickory Lake
For my telephones and bottles and roller skates
Down forty feet in the Cumberland mud
There's a rusty old gun that once shed blood
Out a hundred yards from my lakeside house
Weighted down with a rock is a skirt and blouse
A dozen pair of boots that made a dozen corns
Trombones, trumpets, harmonicas and horns
And the tapes that I threw from the lakeside door
Silverstein, and Kristofferson from years before
Everything has a story that should be let be
So don’t make a movie ‘bout me.
If they're hot on a book called Man in Black
Tell 'em I've got the rights and won't give back
If you don't know my tune you can't get it right
I don't talk about me in . . . Man in White.

Truth, said the Master, cannot be hid
But he didn't say slap it in the face of my kids.
A stone is a stone and forever a stone
But I'm part good and bad and then I'm gone.

There is no sin cleaner than the dirtiest
So there's a lot about me that I don't want missed
If it's days or years or whatever will be
Don't make a movie 'bout me.

Aw, I might as well face it cause they will some day
So while I can I've got a thing to say
I don't know anybody that I said I don't know
And there ain't anybody anywhere I owe

The I.R.S. gets the lion's share
And what is left goes to my own named heirs.
Don't let 'em make it in Hollywood
If they must, tell 'em Arkansas is where they should.

Here’s a hex on whoever makes it be,
So don’t make a movie 'bout me.
For Love or Monee
Don't make a movie 'bout me.

[Verse]
You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah

[Bridge]
Now I'm in the moment, now I'm in the zone
I don't need no pills to lose control
'Cause life is a party, didn't you know?
It follows me everywhere I go
It might be the music, it might be the drink
But I'm feelin' somethin' deep within

[Chorus]
I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like ponytails: tight and bob a lot
Stop, stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly, brown, 6-0, sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It’s an intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped, then release
A statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF?  You silly
I’d like to take “Mens to the End” for two milli’
“Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!”  That’s an audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble. yo
Watch your own back.  Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone, turn H2O to Cognac

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by Mister Jason]
“On Doomsday” - Sample from MF DOOM - “Doomsday”
“Operation: Doomsday”
“MF?  You silly” - Sample from MF DOOM - “Doomsday”
“Operation: Doomsday”

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
I wrote this one in B.C.D.C. O-section
If you don’t believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on C-Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if ain’t no escape, blame MF tape
Definition: “Supervillain,” a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I’m trading science fiction with my man, the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime.  Get out
My face, asking ‘bout my case.  You need toothpaste
Refresher mint, monkey-style nigga the Dentadent
And dope fiends still in their teens, shook niggas turn
Witness, real mens mind their own business
That’s the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that’s
Double Dutch, how come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.’s make rounds, never had ox found
On shakedown, lockdown, wet dreams of Fox’ Brown

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by Mister Jason]
“On Doomsday” - Sample from MF DOOM - “Doomsday”
“Operation: Doomsday”
“MF” - Sample from MF DOOM - “Doomsday”

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Some M-er F-ers don’t like how Sally walk
I’ll tell y’all fools it’s hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let it interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nibbling tip of nipple: Metal Fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang, known amongst
Foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang guzzled out a rusty tin
Can.  Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang!  Crime don’t pay.  Listen, youth
It’s like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spitting all out the sunroof through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turnt it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife, able
To drop today’s math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap.  Far as rap, touch the mic
And get the same shit a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil?  He on another level
It’s a word!  No, a name!  MF the Supervillain!

[Outro: MF DOOM]
Doomsday!

[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Verse 2]
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

[Pre-Chorus]
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
You know, in this town an artist really needs a lot of space when they're trying to create something special. A place to cultivate a world of their own, far away from the real world that's around them.

Luckily for me, I live right inside the middle of the 'H' of the Hollywood sign, and this is how I spent most of my nights: perched high above the chaos that swirls within the City of Angels below. Now don't get me wrong, I love to dip my toe into the muck and the mires of the city every now and then, especially on Tuesdays. But truthfully, when I'm in the middle of making a record - especially now, when the world is in the middle of such a tumultuous period - I find I really need to take the space for myself, far away from real life to consider what my contribution to the world should be in these dark times.

So each morning I have the luxury of asking myself, "What shall I cook up for the kids today? Something with a little spice? Something with a little bitterness but is ultimately sweet? Or shall I take the day off and turn down the fire, and just take a moment to send my love to them over the ether?" Because sometimes just being pure of heart, and having good intentions, and letting them be known is the most worthy contribution an artist can make.

So, even though these times can feel a little bit crazy, they're not so very different from what other generations have experienced at one time or another before. Amidst all the uncertainty, and as we transition out of one era into another one, there's no place I'd rather be than smack-dab in the middle of 'Hollyweird' making this record for you. Because you and the music, and this place are my love, my light, and my lust for life.

[Verse 1]
Kindness, goes a long way
Like weeks to the months, and months to the always
When you find us, with our blinders
Can you be the plus to my minus?
Minus, the vaginas
The test of time, always test of the weakness
What's your business, can you be my witness?
This is realer than fuckin' Christmas

[Pre-Hook]
Gonna get it done, gonna get ready
Gonna jump and I'm gonna get money
Get 

[?], misery to ecstasy
But I could use some company
Gonna get it done, gonna get ready
Gonna jump and I'm gonna get money
Get 

[?], misery to ecstasy
But I could use some company

[Bridge]
Tracking me with no idea
Stalking on social media
Phantom, undetected
Flockin' 'round like you ain't here
Tracking me with no idea
Stalking on social media
Phantom, undetected
Flockin' 'round like you ain't here

[Hook]
It's not funny when you're ghosting me
'Cause you wanna go away and make money
What the load is poverty?
Is it the only way to get equality?
It's not funny when you're ghosting me
'Cause you wanna go away and make money
What the load is poverty?
Is it the only way to get equality?

[Verse 2]
MIA, I disappear
But you can still see me in here
When you no call me near
What you gonna give 'em for their fear?
Im the CIA, you're a player
So I'll see ya, don't wanna be you

[?] expire
You use to call me but now you call Siri, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Gonna get it done, gonna get ready
Gonna jump and I'm gonna get money
Get 

[?], misery to ecstasy
But I could use some company
Gonna get it done, gonna get ready
Gonna jump and I'm gonna get money
Get 

[?], misery to ecstasy
But I could use some company

[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
It's been a long ride, but I made it here with love
I made it here with love, love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it has, yeah
Before a love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya
Oh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds, I'm movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yeah, gotta love yourself
Uh, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I decided not to use my color as a handicap
He a designer, artist, producer, and he rap
Never found virtue from patience
In a dark room just pacin'
Precious time is just wastin'
You do not know what we facin'
I cannot be complacent
In my job, be courageous
Another kid just got shot
They can't find the assailant
Made it out of the basement
Made it out of the underground
From a time where you outta town
They might gun you down, blaow
There goes another round, blaow
There goes another round
Came from this Chi and wow, look what the fuck they found
A young legend, comin' to shut the summer down
You need to talk to me like you don't bring your mother 'round

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
I don't feel no ways tired
Can't get restless in my soul
Hold your heart, the world is cold
Keep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman
Yeah, it will come to pass
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
God knows that you're worth it
You deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else
Somebody else

[Verse 1]
Tell me how you figure that you made me
And you gave me what I had before I meet ya
Ain't gon' have it when you're gone
And how you fix your mouth to say I owe you
When you had another bitch and taking trips and shit
With my money for so long
You must have lost it, nigga, you won't get a dime
But all you're gonna get, too bad, I can't get back my time
Wasted all this time
I'ma be alright, be just fine, woo

[Chorus]
There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you, 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

[Verse 2]
Yes, I cut that bitch 'cause things was running through my brain
And what I found out 'bout you was enough to go insane
All this time to think that you were just here for my name
I was loving you and you were only playing games
Oh, what a damn shame

[Chorus]
There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you, 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, I spent so many hopeless nights
Thinking you were really there
Thinking you would come home
Maybe that you care
But I'm wrong again
You never were my friend
All alone
Now I'm finally free to be me, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, yeah, ooh

[Chorus]
There's a special place in hell for you
You gon' pay for what you did to me
I'ma tell you 'cause the truth will see me free, oh

[Outro]
Gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya
Gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya, oh
If I keep it in, it'll drive me crazy
So thank you, thank you for listening
Thank you for pulling me through

[Verse 1]
You fell in love with who you're lookin' at
Something has changed and there's no hiding that
Sometimes I wish that I can read your mind
And see what secrets you have I can't find

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you're doing
Or how you spend your time
I've been getting this feeling
That something just ain't right
And I hope that I'm wrong
I don't wanna be right
You won't do this to me
Not me, not me

[Chorus]
Why you asking me these questions? It's me
You know I ain't hiding nothing, it's me, it's me
You know I wear everything on my sleeve
You already know
It's me, it's me
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
I have always been the same girl, it's me, it's me
Why is it a problem now?
It's like you just figured out
That it's me, it's me, it's me

[Verse 2]
Is there something you wanna talk about?
'Cause everything I do upsets you now
I'm starting to feel some type of way
Starting to feel like it's a game, and I don't wanna play

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you're doing
Or how you spend your time
No, I've been getting this feeling
That something just ain't right
And I hope that I'm wrong (I hope)
I don't wanna be right
You won't do this to me
Not me, not me

[Chorus]
Why you asking me these questions? It's me
Oh, you know I ain't hiding nothing it's me, it's me
You know I wear everything on my sleeve
Everything, everything
You already know (you, you, you already know)
It's me, it's me
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
(Why you acting like a stranger, yeah)
I have always been the same girl it's me, it's me (I never had a representative)
Why is it a problem now? (Why?)
It's like you just figured out
It's me, it's me, it's me (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I don't really understand
Is this really happening?
Am I crazy?
No, it ain't me
You're the one that's losin' it
Why you lookin' at me so different
Thought I used to be your best friend
Now on the outside looking in

[Chorus]
Why you asking me theses questions? It's me (Why, why, oh why?)
You know I ain't hiding nothing it's me it's me
(You know I ain't hiding nothing, babe)
You know I wear everything on my sleeve (Everything)
You already know me
It's me, it's me (you already know)
Why you acting like a stranger? It's me
(Why you acting like a stranger, babe)
I have always been the same girl it's me, it's me
(I have always been just plain old me)
Why is it a problem now
It's like you just figured out
It's me, it's me, it's me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

The Queen

[Verse 1]
I know he hurt you after swearing that he would change
You're not the first to take him back again and again
And you ain't the first to cry, ain't the first one asking why
So you can't give up the fight, you never know when it's your time

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how valuable you are, you are, you are
Don't let what he put you through cause you to close your heart

[Chorus]
I know your heart is aching, but you can't let him break it, baby
You gotta love like you never been hurt, to find a love that you deserve
Indestructible, indestructible
Indestructible, to find love you must be indestructible
Oh, you must be indestructible

[Verse 2]
I know it took you to a place where there was no love and he left you so numb
You're protecting your heart but girl, you need it, don't let him take away your feelings
Oh, so much to get over, you're feeling stuck but you wanna move forward
If you ready then love will find you, keep moving, don't look behind you

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how valuable you are, think about it, think about it, girl
Don't let what he put you through cause you to close your heart

[Chorus]
I know your heart is aching, but you can't let him break it, baby
You gotta love like you never been hurt, to find a love that you deserve
Indestructible, indestructible
Indestructible, to find love you must be indestructible
You must be inde-inde-indestructible, oh yeah

[Bridge]
You never know where love's gonna come
So you gotta be ready
I'm staying open
To the possibility that it's coming for me
You don't wanna end up in the place where you're not real
It would be so sad if you got to a place where you can't hear

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how valuable you are, think about it, think about it, girl
Don't let what he put you through cause you to close your heart, don't let him make you feel it

[Chorus]
I know your heart is aching, but you can't let him break it, baby
You gotta love like you never been hurt, to find a love that you deserve
Indestructible, indestructible
Indestructible, to find love you must be indestructible

[Outro]
Don't let him break you down
Oh, you must be strong
You must be strong
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I been laying here, waiting for something
Realizing I'm waiting for nothing
Because I gotta get it, get it
'Cause ain't no one doing it for me
I'm the only one telling my story
And I come such a long way

[Pre-Chorus]
From really feeling like I'm gonna lose it
Now I'm helping somebody get through it
Yeah, I feel pain but I use it
To break through the confusion
That has nothing to do with
Where I'm going 'cause I'm determined to win
There's no losing

[Chorus]
No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit
All the glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

[Verse 2]
They keep telling me, "Mary, it's over"
Had your run but girl, look at the numbers
Maybe you should just quit it, quit it
But I'm nearly finished the chapter
And they can't keep me from what I'm after
'Cause I come such a long way

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm finally seeing me clearly
And I can work with the pain 'cause you build me
'Cause now I know how to use it
To break through the confusion
That's got nothing to do with
Where I'm going 'cause I'm determined to win
There's no losing

[Chorus]
No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit
All the glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor, oh
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nothing's gonna stop me, no, no, no, no
I paved the way, woah
For so many to break free
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
No matter how hard, I'ma still keep my light up
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
No matter how hard, I'ma shine even brighter

[Chorus]
No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit
All the glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's funny how you think you know someone
Until they pull the switch on you, ooh
You never, ever think they do you wrong
Until one day they flip on ya, hey, hey, ooh
That's the time you know they hurt you bad
Because you know you let your guard down (did it all for you, yeah)
Oh, Lord, you know you heard me
You were so unworthy
And you know you didn't deserve me
I was lost but now I'm found

[Chorus]
So thank you for showing me who you really are
'Cause up 'til now, I wouldn't believe
You would go this far
See you tryna hurt me
What was deep inside but that wasn't you
Oh, but thank you, baby
Really thank you, thank you, baby
'Cause I know the truth

[Verse 2]
I must admit you caught me by surprise
When you showed me your true colors, yeah
I can't believe I ever trusted you
Considered you my friend and my lover, woo
I think of how I went so hard for you
Gave my heart to you
Went to war for you
I got scars for you
Would have did time behind bars for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Thank you, baby, really thank you, baby
'Cause now I finally, now I know the truth
Thank you for showing me who you really are
Oh, 'cause up 'til now, I wouldn't believe
You would go this far
See you tryna hurt
What was deep inside, but that wasn't you
Oh, but thank you, baby
Really thank you, thank you, baby
'Cause now I know the truth

[Bridge]
I know they say the truth hurts, but a lie kills
I shoulda known that before, you ain't for real
Mind yourself, oh, I'm so mad
But I thank you, thank you, thank you
When people show you who they are, we should believe them
How could I let it get this far?
I could have seen it
But now I see the light and I'm alright
And I thank you, thank you, thank you

[Verse 1]
Energy so still in the air
Everybody's running scared
You used to be so care free, used to be so happy
Used to have everything we need

[Chorus]
Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love

[Verse 2]
How beautiful are you and me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Living out our wildest dreams
We can be anything, we can have everything
Just keep the faith in what you believe
Gotta live it up
You only get one life
Gotta give it all
Give up all the strife
Woah, woah, woah
Life is hard and you know
All the hate, it really is too much
So we got to find the love

[Chorus]
Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
We gotta find the love, we gotta
We gotta find the love
Is it over here? Is it over there?
We gotta find the love
Don't look around, find the love
It's deep inside, find the love
Find the love, find the love
Find the love

[Bridge]
We don't have to look so far, we don't, no
Because it's right there in our heart, right there in our heart, yeah
Feels like it's so hard to find, looking everywhere
Because it's deep inside our love

[Chorus]
Now we gotta find the love, find the love
Find the love, find the love
People, we gotta find the love, find the love, looking everywhere
Find the love, find the love
We gotta find the love, we gotta just gotta find the love
Find the love
Find the love
Find it, find it
We just gotta find the love, find the love
There's a better place for us
We just gotta find the love, find the love

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
If I tell the truth, I would say that I've been hurt many times before
So it's hard for me to ever wanna give anybody, anybody else love
What's bitter and broken until you, shoved inside my heart
I guess God needs you where you are
'Cause the pain I felt before, don't exist anymore

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You light up my dark, oh
I been broken for a long time
Now I'm standing in the sunshine
It's kinda crazy how you made me smile
'Cause the winds in my life been blowing
But you made me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause I never thought I had enough
I been holding back a lot of love
But you make me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause it's scaring me, darling
And I'm falling and falling
Just make sure you catch me
I'm only thinking 'bout now
How you make me smile, smile, smile

[Verse 2: Prince Charlez]
I feel strong, I feel well
I feel confident, better about myself
Life was dust, yeah, turned to coal
And I guess it's your time, you found a diamond in my soul

[Chorus: Prince Charlez]
So you lighten up my dark, my dark
I been broken for a long time
Now I'm standing in the sunshine
It's kinda crazy how you make me smile
'Cause the winds in my life been blowing
But you make me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause I never thought I had enough
I been holding back a lot of love
But you make me smile
I just wanna know how

[Bridge: Prince Charlez & Mary J. Blige]
I been touching all around, you know
I been looking all around for you
And I finally see the light
Took me a long time
But I'm glad I finally know the truth
I forgot about the hurt I knew
I just wanna give my love to you
'Cause a mirror don't scare me
Now

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Prince Charlez]
I feel strong, I feel well
I feel confident, better about myself
You're really making me smile
You make me smile
And I wanna know how
'Cause it's scaring me, darling
And I'm falling and falling
Just make sure you catch me
I'm only thinking 'bout now
How you make me smile, smile, smile
How you do it

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna cry, no, not again
So much on my mind, you gotta understand
I ain't got much time for you, so I
Rather be alone, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you miss you water
What you gonna do? Your well went dry
Was I the one you thought of?
I know you see that pain behind these eyes
Now I know you're caught up
Damn, I know you're caught up, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm not gonna die, no, not again
My heart won't survive this pain again
But I'll be alright, yes indeed
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm strong, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you miss you water
What you gonna do? Your well went dry
Was I the one you thought of?
I know you see that pain behind these eyes
Now I know you're caught up
Damn, I know you're caught up, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool

[Bridge]
So what if you did this to me?
Why you set me free?
I need a man, lover of my soul
Someone who cares for me
Cares for all of my needs
Was blind but now I see
You're not the one

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool
Ooh, baby, you're not telling the truth
After all that I done for you
Still tryna play me for a fool

[Verse 1]
I'm a woman, hear me out
Never claiming to be something I'm not
Don't want what's yours, just want what's mine
Not tryna take over, I just want my spots

[Pre-Chorus]
How can life go on without me here?
It's impossible, oh, oh
All the pain endured to give life
And we keep giving and giving and giving and that's the

[Chorus]
Strength of a woman
Is the, I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman

[Verse 2]
Not saying move over, I'm just here to help
That's what God made me for, you ain't gotta build by yourself
You got your pride, don't let it make you blind
Don't need to be walking behind, you're better with me by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
How can life go on without me here?
It's impossible, oh, oh
All the pain endured to give life
And we keep giving and giving and giving and that's the

[Chorus]
Strength of a woman
Is the, I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman
Strength of a woman
Is the, I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman

[Bridge]
We're the wisdom like a guiding light
We're the trees left standing through the storms of life
We've come so high and we've come so far
Can't hold us back

[Chorus]
Strength of a woman
Is the, I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman
Strength of a woman
Is the, I'll be the rock when you needed the pill for your sleep
I am woman, you know
And I shouldn't have to prove it 'cause it's just what I do
I am woman

[Verse 1]
Hello father, it's your daughter
Need your wisdom, drinking water
Need your wisdom, understanding
Can't live without your love, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Working hard tryna make me things right (working so hard)

[Bridge]
This world is a tricky place (yes, it is)
He would tell you you can, yes indeed (he would tell you you would dear)
All the mistakes are made (and he say you can't be forgiven)
But we gotta make our minds up, yes indeed

[Chorus]
Working hard tryna make me things right (working so hard)
I'm so glad I'm living in your light (oh, I am)
And I can't make it without you (I can't)
No, no, no (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Outro]
I don't know
Hello father, thank you so much
I'm so grateful, for all your love
I'm so grateful for your love, it's enough God
I need you, only you, Lord, yeah, yeah
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you
Everything here, I am blessed and highly favored
Because of all your love
Jesus is the reason, yeah

[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol’ up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)

Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

[Verse 2]
Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)

Put some Uvo on it (Uvo)
Oh, need some Uvo on it (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, F it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some - who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground stuff that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that - was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Hook: Elton John]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty crummy man, you're like his favorite idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sucker rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too

[Hook: Elton John]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, - ! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shoot, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Hook: Elton John]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 4: Eminema]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that sh*t intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how messed up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this junk about us meant to be together?
That type of junk'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one - on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

[Outro: Eminem]
Damn…

[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & Ludacris]
Aw yeah, yeah
I mean there's a lot of women out here that's just, you know
They just deficient in so many things, man
You missing so many key nutrients in your life
I, I just want you to stay healthy in these streets
Oh, no no
Somebody gotta give you some vitamin D, you know what I mean?
Yeah, Luda

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
She got them handlebars
Gotta keep a tight grip on that donkey
She be givin' out battle scars
'Cause she got a tight grip on that monkey
She told me, all the weight, go straight to that ass
Make a student be late for the class
She make a nigga wanna holla even throw a couple dollars
So I gotta get straight to the cash
I love big cheeks in between them sheets
Jump back, I can't help myself
Got a nigga so weak and I get no sleep
'Cause the girls stay wetter than Michael Phelps
And she get right down to the business
She stimulate the five senses
And she like it when I grab her hair
But I might pull out them extensions
My intentions is good for her
She like that I'm rich and a lil hood for her
I beat it right and leave it good sore
Real niggas is always what I stood for
I'm all in, I don't play with it
I fall in and I lay in it
If I call in, I might stay in it
And if it's all a sin, then I'll pray in it

[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
She got them thunder thighs
I'm just tryna get struck by some lightnin'
Man, her booty is plus her size
And I like my cakes with some icin'
Yeah baby, 

[ciero a milo
Que a sabora azucca]
Bonita, freaky lil chica
Let's try the whole Kama Sutra, get down
Drip down, let it trickle down, dig her down
Smack it up, flip it and rub it down, love her down
I'ma keep it 100 now, that girl nasty
I'm never lettin' the opportunity pass me
But I love her boots when they thigh high
Guess it's true what they say when you're havin' fun, the time, it really do fly by
Take her legs, put 'em sky high
Climb to the top, I'ma skydive
Off, you feel the pump like it's sawed off
Shot gun, hold tight, don't fall off
Work, I'ma call off
Don't be tryna leave, lil mama, that's too much ass to haul off
You need a U-Haul, if you leave me, woman, I'ma get blue balls
'Cause ain't nobody got sex like you
That can dress like you or impress like you
You make a brother wanna woosa

[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Ooh, she got that snapback
Kinda ass if you blink, that it might hurt you
All up on the Snapchat
Try to get a screenshot and she might curse you
That there be your eyes only
Love when she grind on me
If they said I'm talkin' shit
You know someone was lyin' on me
She ain't for that he say, she say
This shakin' the DJ replay
Is like everyday is her bday
'Cause everyday's her get this D day
And she got to work with a smile on
And her skin is always glowin'
And her JJ ain't all in the streets
'Cause she ain't out her hoein', Luda

[Chorus: Ludacris & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, take the D (she said she can take it)

[Intro]
Ha ha, Yessir
You know this one's going out to all my T Dot Girls, baby
Ha, what they look like rounds, ha ha
Yea, you know how we do it for the shorties reppin' out the T.O. right
That's right, yea I like the Blue Jay fitted, no lie
You know with the Gabbana shades, but you know bae
With the little dog inside, haha
How you doing that baby
Summer returned, had to give you this

[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets? Your bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? Your bullets?

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away

[Verse: Noname]
Can you remember the message?
Rawr
Can you remember the message?
I took a couple of seconds
Be second-guessin' on your answer machine
She ain't calling you up, calling your bluff
I took a puff puff puff pass
You was cigarette monstrous, a mad man
Eating our fruit snacks like this was your last chance, ooh
To be a kid again, I'm only kidding - JK
John Kennedy remedy fine identity
And being real young, real smart, real specific
The new prolific
A little tab in your mouth like you newly tripping
Who thought the birdy in your window was a cockroach?
A dark approach to a road less traveled
I know you seen a ghost singing on your avenue by Woo Park
Sentimental signature taking a new start, most def
My umi said shine your light on the world, preserve it
Smoking all these cigarettes wasn't my purpose
I'm chilling 'round the way smoking weed like true
Hazy gray cloud all up in my room

[Chorus]
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy

[Verse 1]
Sleep on a plane, wake up in a different state
Rock the stage, get paid and off to a different date
College boys come up offerin' me their haze
And hoes be approachin' me offerin' me some brain (Haha)
I can't complain, people show me love (Love)
Actin' like they know me, but no one really does (Nah)
I say "What up?" and appreciate support
But if you sparkin' conversation, please just make it short
'Cause I ain't got time for no monkey business (Nah)
I stay on the grind for the money in it (Money in it)
I know I'm cool, I definitely rhyme well
Tellin' jokes to these hoes: Jerry Seinfeld (Haha)
See you boo, you can come and meet the crew (Crew)
No one makin' moves like me and Q (Q)
And Big Will got the triple Es locked down
I got all your lil sisters on my jock now
At the bar, no I.D. on me (On me)
Every girl's eyes be on me
Approach 'em, "Why you so lonely?
I'd introduce myself, but you already know me"

[Chorus]
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy

[Verse 2]
Almost famous, see me standin' on the rooftop
High like some tube socks, puttin' on a jukebox
Billboard status, y'all know my face
'Cause I got buzz like a phone on vibrate
Take what's on your plate (What?,) put it on my plate
'Cause I'm hungry and I don't got time to wait (Nah)
I like my ladies fine, kinda how the wine taste (Wine taste)
Hit it from behind, that's a blind date (Aha)
See, the life of a fly boy funny (Fly boy funny)
Always try and multiply more money (More money)
Yeah, I'm cocky and they love it, too (Love it, too)
Walk up in your crib like, "Who the fuck is you?" (Who the fuck is you?)
Sike, try and be a little modest
'Cause I don't have enough paper in my wallet (Not yet)
Parents think I'll be somewhere in a college (Nah)
But I disagree, I'll be somewhere livin' prosperous (Prosperous)
There's a lot of things that I ain't got yet (got yet)
Way we progress kinda hard to process (process)
How I'm so young, such a prospect?
I'm still crawlin', I ain't even start to walk yet (Haha)

[Chorus]
Now ride, just coast
Roll the windows down, see the smoke
When we drive by slow they know who the fuck it is
Reach they arms out to the street, try and touch the whip
They wanna be us, they
They wanna be friends
They wanna see what we be doin' on the weekends
But you can't live my life, boy
Uh, you can't live my life, boy

[Intro]
(Three and four and)
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da-ba-da
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
My boy's bein' sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that, I mean he cuts 'em off
(What?)

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Verse 2]
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (Who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Bridge]
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My-my boy (Love, love, love, love, love, love)
My boy, my (Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright, dude, go trip over a knife)

[Chorus]
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

[Outro]
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours? Well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye

[Verse 1]
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 2]
Oh, come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
You're acting shy, I don't know why
I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Well, I'm looking at you at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
You don't know you're beautiful
You've been so good to me
You give me everything
You've been so good to me
Your love

You've been so good to me
Give you everything
And you've been so good to me
Your love

And ohh baby, You're my consolation
And ohh baby, there's no hesitation
And ohh baby, you're my consolation
And ohh baby, there's no hesitation

You've been so good, you, you

Been so good to me
Give you everything
You've been so good to me
Your love
And you've been so good to me
You give me everything
You've been so good to me
You love inside of me

And ohh baby, you're my consolation
And ohh baby, there's no hesitation
And ohhhh, you're my consolation
And ohh baby, ohh baby

You've been so good to me
You give me everything
You've been so good to me
Your love

[Chorus]
Caught a feel I didn't wanna catch
She's over me, I want her back
Why does it happen to me?
Gotta move on, I got about 3
Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

[Verse]
Girl, was it somethin I said?
You killed my confidence
And left my heart broken
And now I
Can't get you off my mind
Damn what a waste of time
I've spent on you
I'm such a fool, ohhhh

[Chorus]
Caught a feel I didn't wanna catch
She's over me, I want her back
Why does it happen to me?
Gotta move on, I got about 3
Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

[Bridge Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Caught a feel I didn't wanna catch
She's over me, I want her back
Why does it happen to me?
Gotta move on, I got about 3
Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

[Intro]
Wa-ves
You say waves, I say wa-ves
Kaepernick, waddup?
I knew they was gonna do that to you, but it's all good though
You gotta stand up for something, know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Gravitons, orbit around my halo space
Halo space
Little Debbie crumbs and potato flakes
Junkyard food meets 808s
Better say your grace, stay your place
Play your bass
And wait on a upright right up to them niggas that don't like us
Writer, fiber optics on high fiber
Move, quick like that
No Aiko ass, ain't shit like that
Magnum entendre, rollin' on a rubber
Hit Virgin for the album, I was floatin' on the cover
I pit my car, they let a lad in
I was floatin' on the cover, made a message out a mess
Got 'em clothes up the flow then taught 'em how to dress
Made a space so they can milk this way
Had 'em open up the udders
Broken off hat had folks in all colors
I wish a nigga would try and open y'all shutters
Cartier frames, Aoki on a shirt in the red and white chukkas
Why you goin' all hard though?
NASCAR star got bars by the carload
You know LF won to come out the top
But for this ten, I'ma just open up the car door
And my deepness
Might spit the stash box sequence that'll open up the cargo
If I break it down to you lil' homie, might get a nigga car towed
You ain't gotta worry 'bout ours though
DROGAS Light, DROGAS
And I might drop SKULLS as an art show
K-Dot want stretch marks?
I wanna own everything that's west of the best parts
K.R.I.T. everything from the legs down
Mickey Factz everything where the neck starts
Necklace, head, heart, go
Get set, mark, oh

[Chorus]
Turn the mics up
Like a nigga 'round fight club
And the fuzz came through to indict us
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply
Then turn around and drive all the price up
I be speaking it right
But it's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, oh Lord
I be speaking it right
It's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, all right
All right, oh Lord

[Verse 2]
But, I'm back to the mentally
And it’s not about natural ability
You would think that Kaep' took a shat
On the Statue of Liberty, goddamn
It’s like we trapped in a memory
Untrue facts where black is an injury
It makes me wanna snap just to slap me an enemy
Then go into the back and just rap to infinity
Fuck, be more like Chance
Solo acts be more like bands
Adversaries be more like fans
BDs and GDs be more like fam
I’m just vying for the summer
Women lie, men lie, and everybody lie about the numbers
Hard to be smart
When the only thing on your mind's dying from a thumper
I know I'm weird but nigga it's real
Better to hear it from a nigga like Lu
Before you hear it from a nigga like Trump
Talk to a nigga like you, oh Lord

[Chorus]
Turn the mics up
Like a nigga 'round fight club
And the fuzz came through to indict us
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply
Then turn around and drive all the price up
I be speaking it right
But it's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, oh Lord
I be speaking it right
It's hard to believe that people still believe
That Jesus is white, all right
All right, oh Lord

[Outro]
Yeah, DROGAS, DROGAS, DROGAS, yeah
In stores now, uhh, and we going on tour too
Lu! Truly yours
Wa-ves on the way, it's genius!
Oh Lord, know what I'm talking about?
Izzy, waddup?!

[Verse 1: Trung Ngo]
Girl I finally learned that you're just trouble
Grow nostalgic, but it's so ephemeral
And I remember that you're the cancer to my soul
I stood there, she gloated, she's happy, duly noted
No need to get everyone else involved
I'm waiting, she hates me, she says that karma's fading
No problem that a shaman couldn't solve
So take me up the mountain, bring me to the temple
Spill my guts into the sacrificial vessel
No pills or anaesthetic is allowed, the screaming is so loud
And I wonder who she's kissing now

[Chorus]
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin'

[Verse 2: Trung Ngo]
If you're lonely come join the ceremony
No experience required come and dance around the fire
Take off your pretty dress, take off your painted flesh
Count to ten then we'll take care of all the rest
We'll get down on our knees, we'll worship at your feet
We'll rip your heart out just to show you that it beats
Then we'll throw it out cause that's what love is all about
And it's time that you found out
I wonder who she's kissin' now

[Chorus]
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin'
(Snippet)

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah

[Thew new one before guess ??]
Young nigga started with oodles and noodles, now we eating lobster (Ah)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
As I walk through the valley with my ladder and flex
I'm the realest nigga in it I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a 

[??] and flip they ass to the back
Fuck 'em, new jewelry, new whips on the way now

[Beat Switch]

Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Lil' bitch, you don't call me lil' fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, I'm still lit
Streets calling and they said they was some real shit
Young bull looking like he in a real lick

[Beat switch]

I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin
Half a milli last week you

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep!

[Chorus]
You made the atom split
It caused a massive rift
And he came screaming through
Here to bite the head from you

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep, oh!

[The Reticent Raconteur]
Balrog fears not the Lightning Lord
He's fixed on us, has him ignored

[Verse 1]
Feel a tingle
Rolling up your left arm when you
Think of evil
Lurking in the darkness where you
Shine your eyesight
Something tells you this is not right
Take some advice
Have you heard the murmurings of

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep!

[Chorus]
You caused a massive rift
You made the atom split
And it came screaming through
Here to bite the head off you

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog

[The Reticent Raconteur]
I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at its expression
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression
I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot
He is here, fully formed, and glowing red and lapis hot

[Verse 2]
Heated menace
Comes to gouge the heart out from us
Blazing zealot
Preaching on the apocalypse
I don't want to
Submit to his awful torture
Save me from him
Have you heard the murmurings of

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, oh!

[Verse 3]
Skin begins to burn
There's nowhere we can turn
There's no way we can win
The devil puppets him
His pyre muscles flex
We are his next subjects
His power has us floored
Kneel before the overlord

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, yes, oh!

[The Reticent Raconteur]
For them, the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemoth
And as they prepared for afterlife there appeared the endemic monstrosity
The Lighting Lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity
Furious he pummeled his breast, and a blaze alit the heavens
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog, the Lord's finger beckoned

[Verse]
They ain't fucking with my clique
My clique, my clique, my clique
And bitches on my dick
Because I'm on the shit
I'm a pimp, a pimp, a pimp, a pimp
You can tell it by the limb
I'm eating steak and shrimps
Now, look at this nigga comin' down the road with the hoes
Goes up in his clothes
And you know I do it I suppose
Bitches love my name
And I come through with a Rove'

Talk about it
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you want to do

[Verse 1]
Watch out for some of those high flying rides you've been takin'
You know the ones that are flying too low
Look out for some of those airplane rides you've been takin'
Especially the ones that are flying too low

[Chorus]
Talk about it
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you want to do

[Verse 2]
Flyin' through the air on a kite every day and every night
It's a bigger risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right
Yeah, I'm playing too much in one tour, baby
Just up there
Escape to the crippled night
Oh yeah
And you look around and see all the jellyfish
You sayin' flotation's groovy baby
And even he'll tell you that
Yeah, getting high every day is easy
And floatin' around, even a jellyfish will agree to that

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm sayin' with the power of you

[Chorus]
Talk about it
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you want to do
Missing you felt like pulling teeth
I taste the metal when you're next to me
It's so cold and sweet
It makes me wanna take it back

To the night when your car died
Kissing in the rain on a summer night
It was warm and sweet
It makes me wanna take it back

Kissing you felt like a lack of strength
The touch of your lips made my legs go weak
It was warm and sweet
It made me wanna take it back

To the night when it all began
I thought that fun was what I wanted then
Something cold but sweet
I wish that I could get that back
Wish that I could feel like that
Wish that I could get it
But remember what it felt like
When you told me it was the last time
I'd be seeing you

Missing you felt like I lack of rain
But I could be drowning if you'd say my name
It be warm and sweet
It'd make me wanna take it back

To the night when we last hung out
I knew that love was what I wanted now
But I got cold feet
I wish that I could take that back
Wish that I could take you back
Wish that I could take it

To the night where I first met you
I remember just how I left you
With I'd be seeing you

But remember what it felt like
When you told me it was the last time
I'd be seeing you

She just wanna act ghetto when the cameras flash
She just wanna act ghetto, act ghetto, act ghetto, act ghetto

[Verse 2: A.E.]
Uh, bought that whip off the show room (Skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, she do the same things them hoes do and that makes her a hoe too

Uh, drunk off the sake and the soju juice, yeah, drop out, pull up in a old school, ooh
Drop out but I'm pullin' drops out, got my cock out like I told you
Heard the rumours 'bout you were so true, you thirsty and you ain't got no juice
And gettin' bread somethin' that we toast to
Two girls asked me what I'm gon' do, I said both of you

[Verse 3: Tyga]
You don't know what we have to go through
All my day ones is my go-tos
Got my own show just to show you
I don't trust you as far as I can throw you
Ch-ch-chop it up like Pro Tools
White diamonds drippin' like '02
Niggas want beef but they tofu
They like G.O.O.D. Music, baby, that's a good move

[Chorus: Chief Keef & Tyga]

[Intro]
Huh, Drop Top Wop (skrt)
Ha

[Verse]
Tell the valet to be careful, when he park my whip
Hol' up, he don't even look like he can park my whip
Jump out right in front of the club like I own this bitch
Who that ridin' with cha? Oh, that's just the dopeman bitch
Got my arm out the window showin' off my wrist
Got the top chopped off like I ain't got good sense
Call me Vert Gucci, it's a lotta niggas wanna murk Gucci
No Gucci, not the old Gucci, not the fat Gucci
Please don't bring him back, not the old Big Cat Gucci
Standing in the trap, use a eggbeater that Gucci
This ain't hip hop this is drug dealer music
I won’t give a fuck if you don’t listen to it
See this one for my nigga just came home and did a ten piece
Now he on some M's in the Flame every Wednesday
Zone 6, 5 plus the fucked up penitentiary
If you ain't signed to 1017, you against me
And I ain't got no friends, I ain't motherfucking friendly
If you ain't got more money than me you can't really diss me
This the type of vibe, make a trapper buy a Bentley
Know you tryna tempt me but ain't nobody listenin'
See, when I walk on stage they give me a quarter ticket
My watch a quarter ticket, I'm givin' them the business
All my artists dipped, guess they thought it was over
I knew they'd all jump ship cause they was part time soldiers
Gucci Mane LaFlare and I will never roll over
You act like you's my man but you's a cold heart cobra
I think these fools forgot that I'm a self-made mogul
No hard top, drop top, Lambo, doors up
Soft top, Rolls-Royce, white bitch, dough up
Got grown men wanna be like Gucci when they grow up
Maybach, backseat, no shirt iced up
White Ghost, no sir not mine all hers
Double R, new truck all white mink floor
Benz Jeep, all red, red rims, trap car
White Range, small change that's my everyday car
God take my breath away if all of them ain’t paid for
Why the call you Drop Top? What I need a top for?
Known to drip excessively that's what she brought the mop for
Why they call you Guwop? 'Cause a lotta guap, bra
Haters done tried everything but ain't no way to stop us
Say I’m young and I won’t argue with you baby
Say you’re gone and I won’t chase after you
Say you don’t want me and I won’t wish I were dead
Or that you were here beside me
Every chance I get

‘Cos I won’t mind waiting around
‘Cos honey who else am I waiting for?
And I don’t mind, drag me around
‘Cos honey I’m so used to sleeping on your floor
On your floor

I won’t wonder where you are whenever I go out
I won’t wish you to my room when I fall asleep and now
I won’t think of you no more whenever I’m alone
At least I’ll have the decency to lie and say I don’t

‘Cos I don’t mind waiting around
‘Cos darling who else am I waiting for?
And I don’t mind, drag me around
‘Cos honey I’m so used to sleeping on your floor
And I won’t mind when you choose somebody else
And I won’t mind when you break my heart
And I won’t mind going out all by myself
And I’ll try not to wonder where you are

So I won’t think of you no more whenever I’m alone
At least I’ll have the decency to lie and say I don’t

I don’t mind, I don’t mind

Say I'm flossing, say I'm bossing
Now I'm flossing, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Tyga & King]
Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, flossing, flossing
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
Say I'm bossing (I'm bossing)
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
We at Bosonova
I'm bossing, I'm flossing
I'm flossing, I'm bossing
But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting

[Verse 1: Tyga]
You had it, you lost it
You lost it, yeah you lost it
I found it, I got it, got the plug and the sake
My vanilla girl like chocolate
My chocolate girl like caramel
My caramel girl like dairy flavored
Drippin' like the faucet
I'm flossing, I'm flossing
I'm floss and flossing
She just got her ass shots, we into the soften
She bossing, she boss and send five texts at ???
Everytime we hit the mall, they should bring a coffin
I'm cocky, I'm flossing, put a porch to the Porsche
It can get exhausting, all this fucking flossing
Diamonds in my teeth, when I smile I sparkle
I should be a dentist, I could teach you how to floss it

[Chorus: Tyga & King]
Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, flossing, flossing
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
Say I'm bossing (I'm bossing)
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
We at Bosonova
I'm bossing, I'm flossing
I'm flossing, I'm bossing
But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Called up some hoochies, I'm 'bout to throw a party
Where'd she get that ass, she got it from her mama
I'm saucy, I'm flossing, I'm saucy, balsamic
And I'm paid in full, I should be from Harlem
Just pulled up on Rocky, we both was in ferraris
Whoa kemo- (whoa kemo-), flossing is a hobby
And I'm on your TV, whoa hashetashe
All my ice is water, yours is wishy-washy

[Chorus: Tyga & King]
Yeah I'm flossing, flossing, flossing, flossing
Floss, floss, I'ma a boss, I should be from Boston
Say I'm flossing (I'm flossing)
Say I'm bossing (I'm bossing)
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting
We at Bosonova
I'm bossing, I'm flossing
I'm flossing, I'm bossing
But this ain't Hugo Boss
Bitch we flossing, flossing, yeah we flossing, flossing
I got all the cake, she gon' bring the frosting

Wordplay

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
A nigga so fly that I should have been a pilot
I know a nigga rap but I could have been a stylist
Feel like a jeweler 'cause I rock so many diamonds (bling)
Could never run for president, my past too violent
Fam so broke that I had to start grindin'
Why I'm lookin' bummy? Everybody else shinin'
Turned into a burglar and did a couple break-ins
Started as a corner boy, then turned into a kingpin
Walkin' in Magic lookin' like I were El Chapo
Hot damn Gucci, that's a cold-blooded Hublot
I can't even fuck with one hoe, I need two
And you ain't gotta call hoe, I don't need you
Jumpin' out a car with no roof in a suit hoe
What type of nigga do the shit that I do hoe?
Started as a group, but I'm so dope I went solo
Get your ass knocked off and call it free promo
Chopper make a nigga back crack like Romo
Gucci go hard on a bitch, no homo
Pull up in an 18-wheeler, me dolo
Feelin' like Sosa was born to move yayo

[Chorus: Rocko]
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Ay, they wanna know, how does it feel to be a star?
How's it feel to ride around the house for your car?
How does it feel to not have to sell that raw?
I'm told 'em I'm way more paranoid 'cause now they hate me more
They say, "Rock, how does it feel to be last of a dying breed?"
You pump life into these streets, they were in dying need
Off that real shit, that softest, that uncut, that raw
That shit that they jam to everyday when they jump up
The law, the word, they meet me in the AM
My voice I bring the gate in, in the evenings, still beatin' me
Hit the club still playing, still playing when they leavin'
(How does that make you feel?)
It feels good, they believe me
They receive me, I am how they perceive me
I put my soul into these lyrics, listen, you will hear it
Backseat Mulsanne, Drop Top and the Dawn
Where would the streets be without the Trap God and the don?

[Chorus: Rocko]
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Fuck your CEO and tell 'em King Gucci said that
Cause I ain't never ever hit a lick and brought the bread back
That's your CEO? We used to gamble for his contract
I damn near lost his first three albums playin' blackjack
Standin' in the trap, catchin' J's in my wavecap
Cappin' 'bout none of these niggas rappin' 'bout a fake trap
Call Ghostbusters 'cause these niggas sellin' ghost crack
Point 'em to the kitchen and the nigga need a roll 

[?]
Put me in the kitchen and I might just bring a whole back
Put a hole in a nigga head, tell him "hold that"
This that eggbeater music, get it out the bowl rap
This that wife beater music, sell it while it wet rap
You a dick rider and I never will respect that
Came out, took my set back, I know they didn't expect that
Gucci worth eight figures, but he tryna stretch that
My partner turned informer on me, I never woulda guessed that

[Chorus: Rocko]
Life's about taking risks
I told my baby pray for me, I'm tryna be all I can be
Put my pants on just like you, so why you envy me?
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm tryna live out my dreams, if I offend you, pardon me
I'm just tryna be all I can be
I'm just tryna see all that I can see
Never mind me, I'm tryna be all I can be, ay

[Verse 1]
I'm so proud of you
And everything that you do
Doesn't matter what they say
They ain't worth a dollar in change
Wish I could be strong like you
Wish I had something to prove
Wanna be a star like you
Wanna make something that's true

[Chorus]
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby down without no money in her bank

[Verse 2]
I wanna be a fake like you
Walk around with rocks in my shoes
I just wanna play the game
Big and fat and insane
I'm so proud of you
And everything that you do
Doesn't matter what I said
I'm better off dead

[Chorus]
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby down without no money in her bank

[Outro]
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I fuck up
Oooh

[Intro]
Oh, yes
Oh, slide

[Verse]
Xenons with the blue color
If that’s a lease, least it look cool on you
That’s your business and I’m off, when I’m on you
Like holidays, I get off on you

[Verse 1]
You have a mythological beauty
You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines
Of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you
Who’s trying to raise a child in me

[Chorus]
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

[Verse 2]
You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriend’s knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave Andrew a family who you thought
Could love and take better care
I have an older brother I don’t know
He could be anywhere

[Chorus]
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

[Verse 3]
Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag
Soaking up blood with your eye
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying, “Don’t let my baby die.”

[Chorus]
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

[Outro]
So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
Look at that sun, look at that sky
Look at my sweater vest, I look so fly
Look at that mailbox, look at that tree
It's about as beautiful as it can be

Whoa, whoa
Today is gonna be exceptional
Never boring even for a minute
It's my world and we're all living in it

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
(We're all living in it)
Never boring even for a minute
It's my world and we're all living in it

[Chorus]
Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

[Post-Chorus]
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-uh, finna be up, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

[Verse 1]
Yuh, we up 'til the day break off
Make up when I take, take off
No sleep, you my sunshine, though
Just me, you, and some wine, look
'Cause we tryna unwind, look
We sleep baby, sometimes, look
Yeah, we got the same schedule, sexual drive
Speed through, I just led you
Spent 15 on it and that's fine
'Cause we already been around five
Lil' weed, Hennessy, kinda sound nice
Finna need new sheets by around nine
Feelin' weak in the knees
Make it bounce like blap-blap-blap
Bed smack to the wall tap-tap-tap
Wait, lemme throw it all back-back-back
Neighbor bangin' on the door

[Refrain]
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies, okay, yeah

[Chorus]

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-uh, finna be up, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

[Verse 2]
Baby I just clocked out
In the middle of the night, need a snack, oh
Ain't tryna knock out
Still workin' on my wine, need a back rub
Wish we could rewind to the bathtub
First night, wreckin' this suite, no pack up
Tuck me like money in a mattress
But we ain't finna sleep on a mattress
Practice, knee-deep in your tactic
Back it up, beep beep, no U-Haul
Tossed salad, no cheese, no croutons
Said it don't taste cheap, no coupon
No drugs, just me's that you's on
Five star, that's sweet, no futon
Dem a' other girl tired, huge yawn
I ain't talkin' 'bout the tea when I Oolong

[Refrain]
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Our moon will be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies, okay, yeah

[Chorus]
Let me break it to you, boy, I, I, I, I
I can give it to you all night
All in all, we pullin' all nighters
We ain't gotta turn on them lights

[Post-Chorus]
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, yea-uh, finna be up, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go

[Verse: 070 Shake & Travis Scott]
And why you keep on askin' what if I ain't had this?
And we just go right at it and I tell you not to panic
'Cause no one understanding us, no one's understanding us
You say I'm a champion so they can't even handle us
Move, I'm in a rush today, for heaven's sake
And I just ate a bunch today, another plate
And I can't really fly, bro, elevate
And really you should travel, meditate
And we been gettin' high, bro, you kinda late
And really all they wanted was for me to graduate
And hang the fucking tassel, but what comes after?
Welcome to the cult, tell the mass I'm a master (Yeah)
I said "fuck religion" and (Fif-) I mated with the pastor
My buddy hit a hundo and I tell him "Go faster"
I'll slay dragon, and then I'll keep the castle
Chasin' all my dreams
If I has to, then I has to
If I has to, then I has to
If I has to, then I has to
If I has to, then I has to
I'm dangerous, ain't no motherfucker taming us
What, what
And who's stopping me? They don't say a thing right now
I'm an animal, I cannot be tamed right now
No time for this ,don't know why I came right now
I'm a champion, got too much to change right now
Quite confident, pretty with chains on now
Red, blue, yellow angels in the scene
Red, blue, yellow angels on my team
Red, blue, yellow angels that I'm seein' (Yeah)

1500, all in singles (Straight up)

Yet sees her face
Her thighs in lace
Oh, why such waste?

[Verse 2]
Ghosts are only negative space
Ancestors, no blood
No place, no mark
Just voices in the dark

The floor is covered in champagne
The leather and the blood, and all the sudden rain
Man, you, you should've seen those cops baptise
The worst-case scenario survival game

He sold out both his eyes
Yet sees her face
Her thighs in lace
Oh, why such waste?

So many blue strips, my pocket look like a crip

Fuck nigga, have it
Oh I'm mobbin', you starvin'
You a victim, I'm robbin'

[Pre-Chorus: SahBabii]
2 love to the mob
With a couple Capos and a hundred fuckin' Dons

Pull up with a stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit

We've committed sin, free my niggas in the pen
Free Omerta

[Verse 3: Loso Loaded]
Mob shit, Purp Gang, that's my gang

Pull up with a stick and I let it hit

Pull up with a stick, let it hit

Bitch I'm with the mob, you can't get in
We've committed sin, free my niggas in the pen
Free Omerta
I’ve been so unafraid to die alone
I know what I’ve done, I heard your tone
Dust off your coat, the rain is coming back
A few months without it, keeps happiness on track
But you would never notice, stuck in that head of yours

You say I’m in love, I say I'm a fool
Look away from me now, I'll look away too

You say I’m in love, I say I'm a fool
Look away from me now, I'll look away too

[Intro]
See, captain, the rain's falling in a A-I-M, the M.I.A

[Verse 1]
We were on a voyager, I was a passenger
The world thinks we're savage, but gave us baggage though
Where am I when I'm not posted up in Kansas?
Where am I when I'm not dropping bombs on Damascus?

[Chorus]
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
Dropping bombs on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
Dropping bombs on Damascus

[Verse 2]
The masses, us in Damascus, the masses have their faces
In the races to save their races tell your bases not to trace us
These seas are about to embrace us, on the land we get the tasers
And these waves might capsize us, and who the fuck is ISIS?

[Chorus]
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
Dropping bombs on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
Dropping bombs on Damascus

[Bridge]
Get the scissors, get the scissors, cut their rope on the bridges
Have to find a better way to reach brand new edges
Get the scissors, get the scissors, cut their rope on the bridges
Have to find a better way to reach brand new edges

[Chorus]
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
Dropping bombs on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
On Damascus, on Damascus
Dropping bombs on Damascus

Don't rush the craft 'cause it's all 'bout timin', ayy
Let's get rich, uh
But when we get rich, gotta stay rich
We gotta double it, invest the guap into some other shit
Some other other shit
Don't spend your money on no other bitch unless you love that bitch

[Chorus]
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy
Let's get richer than a bitch

Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy

Ooh, none of my real niggas switched
That's why I had to keep the game lookin' rich
Ayy my brother didn't have a pot to piss
Now he penthouse sleepin' with his bitch, ayy
With thirty thousand on the wrist
You can do it too, this shit happened to me
And all my blood brothers, man we live by a creed
All in, all win, we all family

Since day one this music shit been for fun
Ayy, we got blessed with a turn
We got blessed with a ton, a million

Let's get rich, ayy, ayy
We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy

[Verse 3]
We gon' be, yeah, we gon' be, yeah
We gon' be on, we gon' be on
They all try to call your phone when you get on
They try to put you in the wrong when you're doin' right
That means you're doin' right
To get rich you don't need no suit and tie
Follow the dreams you see through the night
Through the night
Through the night

[Chorus]
Let's get rich, ayy
Let's get richer than a bitch
We had dreamed about this shit since we was kids, ayy
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy

We gon' be rich forever and ever, we gon' be rich
Come on, my nigga, let's get rich, ayy, ayy
Forever and ever, ayy, ayy

[Intro: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"
She replied, "Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life"
{Gunshot}

[Bridge: Bēkon]
Is it wickedness?

[Outro: Eric Bolling & Kimberly Guilfoyle]
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote
"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'"
Oh, please, ugh, I don't like it

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premiere)
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin’ lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me

Just love me, just love me, just love
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Love me

Love me, just love me

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I’d rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ayy, I got somethin'
Hol' up, we gon' function, ayy, no assumptions, ayy
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I’m with it
Only for the night, I’m kiddin'
Only for life, yeah, homie for life, yeah
Only for life, let’s get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over me
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, all money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn’t ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today (love me)
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio Camry
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me

Just love me, just love me, just love me

Love me, just love me

New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double-parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business (Uno)
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know He walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Verse 2]
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Bridge]
Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Kid Capri]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

Ain't nobody prayin' for me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I’m fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (High, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for, fire)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (I’m on fire)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it’s EDM
Gas in the bitch like it’s premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5: Rihanna & Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus: DJ Dahi & Kendrick Lamar]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby

[Intro: Bēkon]
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn’t there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & RAT BOY]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—

[Break: RAT BOY]
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected

[Verse 1 (cont'd): Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
"Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord"
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"

[Chorus]
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

[Verse 1]
Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—

[Chorus]
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

[Verse 2]
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

[Chorus]
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
This what God feel like

[Intro: Bēkon & Kid Capri]
It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

[Bridge: Ted Taylor (Sampled)]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*

When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

[Verse 3: Shelley FKA DRAM]
Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times (take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart)
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

[Chorus: 2-D]
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart

[Outro: 2-D & Shelley FKA DRAM]
Where it all went down
Where it all went down
Home again
It's so good to be home again
Where you don't have to shed a tear
And it feels so good to be here
Oh oh
Late at night (late at night!)
When the stars outside are shining bright
It's the only place that really feel right
Oh my my
To be hugged up tight with you
Mmmm
To love someone
On a rainy night
To give a 

[?]
To home is alright

I'm home again (home again!)
I can't wait unlock the door
Be yourself and don't put on a show
After all what is home for?
Hey yeah
To see your face
Just to melt into your warm embrace
Nothing on earth can take your place
Hey, got nothing to sing, hey hey
To get where you're going
You're gonna need someone
I'm willing to share my love
Under the sun
Hey hey baby!
It's good to be here
Home again!
Just to see your smiling face!
Just to melt into your warm embrace!
Running around, running around
You can't run away from home
There's nothing around
Hey hey hey baby!
It's good to be home again!
You can just be who you want!

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf movin' slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When’s the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn’t get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can’t)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin’ with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'… got…

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (Obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage, I'm bikin', yeah

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
From Coldwater to the Shaw
Alcoholic way I handle the bars
This a PK, PK Ripper
Nah, you can't fuck with the boy
That's my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smokin' when I stop
Okay, nobody fuckin' with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet
Jackson, I'm savin' the streets
I'm Roger Rabbit in the air
I don't care, Big Willie Style, yeah
Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles

Martin Luther King Jr. (extract from “I have a Dream ”)
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
I have a dream

[Intro: Novelist]
We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical

[Verse 1: Novelist]
We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
Sometimes the best moments in life are minimal
I see more than what's visible
There's more than words and syllables
There's energy, there's flavour
I take time and think about later
Feeling, I know how you're feeling
You're me and I'm you, it's like dreaming
In the cold, the thought of you is like heating
My heart's beating
No words when I look in your eyes, your soul's speaking
The truth is what we're both seeking
I'm ready to learn, let's start healing

[Hook: Tom Misch & Novelist]
(It's the way) We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
(It's the way we grow) We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
(It's the way) We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
(It's the way we flow) We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical

[Verse 2: Novelist]
The sun is behind the clouds, it's internal
So smile sometimes and make that sunshine external
Thinking about what's next, don't worry about hurdles
You're blessed, learning is part of the quest
Just do your best, and the best will do you
Soon see a new you, I can feel when you're near like Bluetooth
I'm in your ear like Bluetooth
Love will bring you a new youth
Accept what's coming your way, in your life is a new truth

[Outro: Tom Misch & Novelist]
It's the way
It's the way we grow
It's the way
It's the way we flow
(It's the way) We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
(It's the way we roll) We could get physical, but there's way much more than the physical
Y​eah you’re cold, about it
Now that you know, about it
Will it show?
I don’t doubt it
Antidote, I found it

Feeling low, about it
On the go, without it
Want to go home, should I shout it?
I miss my home

Now you know, that I’m not all that you thought I would be
Grateful I showed the real me
Yeah it shows
When you look in my eyes, it breaks all my bones

[Chorus]
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down

[Verse 1]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, none a dem boys got caca on ya
Chacha on ya
Roll and I drop that on ya, look
He could be a blaze I don’t stop that on him, though
People be amazed that you mine, I’m cornered, look

Pop the pop the pop, pop that thang
Million of them want that thang
Brilliant, you Einstein that brain
What you really want is that timeless baby
Wifey type
You lie, we lying down
Pickin' in up and takin' it off the ground
Livin' it up vacation cars n crowns
Look, king and queen gon' make prince n princess
Ying or yang we got similar interest
Other fish but they can’t get this wet
Bummy dudes cannot get this rich sex

[Chorus]
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down
I lie, you lie, we lie down down down

[Chorus]
Oh, vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

[Verse 1]
I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my chest
I feel like coughing

[Chorus]
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin, oh

[Bridge 1]
Queasy green
Rotten scoff
Vomit cough

[Han-Tyumi]
And when I declared to my design
Like Frankenstein's monster:
"I am your father, I am your god
And you the magic that I conjure"
The thankless swine
The blasphemous jerk
My creature had no love for me
Which made me berserk

[Soy-Protein Munt Machine]
I am covered in vomit
I am coated in sick
I have no name and no place
This is no way to live

[Han-Tyumi]
So I took over my creation
The spew coated protein
I plugged myself in
And became one with machine

[Verse 2]
I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my neck
I feel like death

[Chorus]
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

[Bridge 2]
Filthy green
Rotten scoff

[Outro]
Vomit vomit vomit vomit
Vomit vomit vomit vomit cough
Chapter 1: The Tale of the Altered Beast

[Narrator]
As soon as the dust settles, you can see
A new world in place of where the old one had been
Your skin is crawling with dry, crusted mud
And your naked feet are wet in a pool of blood
And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud
That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud
And as your eyes accommodate
There appears by the meadow
A brute like a bear with a long, dark shadow
And you violently shake over what you have seen
As you remember the tale of the Altered Beast

[Intro]
When I die..(B.I.G speech reversed)
That's what I was...I wasn't killing myself shit
Fuck,if I was gay,I wouldn't have to worry about nothin'
I could just lay up,and be in heaven when I die

[Verse 1:The Notorious B.I.G]
When I die,fuck it,I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit,it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense going to heaven with the goodie goodies
Dressed in white,I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day,no getting my dick licked
(Hanging with) Hanging with the goodie goodies
Loungin' in paradise,fuck that shit
I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I've been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother,even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime,from drugs to extortion
I bet my mother wish he got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Sucking on her chest,just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I die,would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect
(Forgive me) Forgive me for my lies

[Interlude]
I wasn't even like
"How am I feeling right now?I feel like killing myself"
....It wasn't like that,I was just thinking like
"Damn,stressed up in the same fucking room"

[Verse 2:The Notorious B.I.G]
My baby mother's 8 months,my little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of 'em
I swear to God I wanna just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head threaten to pull shit
And squeeze..until the bed's,completely red
I'm glad I'm dead,a worthless fucking Buddha head
The stress is building up,I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind,I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' calling me
Nah,you wouldn't understand..
You see it's kinda like what crack did to Pookie
In New Jack,except when I cross over,
There ain't no coming back
Should I die on the train tracks,like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had something going on
I reached my peak,I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic,tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lying,I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter fact,I'm sick of talking

[Interlude:Bad Boy Records]
Yo whattup man,did you hear that new toot
Shit,nigga was talking 'bout how I fucked yo bitch,you know all that Shit and he was dissin' and shit
I was like "Yo,what?"then I look in the back seat
This is true talk,can't make this shit up
This mo'fucka look in the back seat and was like
"Oh shit,B.I.G!Lemme get a autograph"
Yo,nigga(Laughter)

[Outro:B.I.G&Headline News reporter]
Yeah
Uh
I like my fleak,and tell me like
I got on...

Earlier this day in Los Angeles,Wallace,
Also known as Biggie Smalls was shot from a
Passing vehicle
He had been named Rap Artist of The Year at the
Billboard Awards 1995

[Verse 1]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Chorus]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
We're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
We're all chained to the rhythm

We're all chained to the rhythm
We're all chained to the rhythm

[Chorus]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Verse 2]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

[Drop]
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Chorus]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
We're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat

[Verse 1]
You’re so sweet to me
Will you be sour later?
Let’s climb in our tree
Looking back, looking back I remember

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stepping out on the moon
Back home where we’re from
Digging your company
These days have just begun

[Chorus]
Nowadays the waves ride high as we crash on the ocean floor
Dusting off the daisy chain you wore when life was new and strange
Taking us back for a change

[Verse 2]
You’re so sweet to me
Bringing treats back from the food trailer
I could leave you a key
Kicking back, kicking back feeling lazy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Tripping around the house
Been away too long
Spinning me all your love
Though I’m lost and gone

[Chorus]
Nowadays you’re still my partner in crime, my cherry lime
Shaking out the stereo with songs we used to know and sing
Taking us back for a change

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

[Pre-Chorus: Both & Miguel]
Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

[Chorus: Both & Miguel]
Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)

[Bridge: Both & Miguel]
Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Miguel & Both]
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
Let's get lost in the light, baby

[Snoop Dogg]
They had been listening to our music and was inspired by what we did and just the fact that, ya know Big Pun was covering it and getting at me to be in the video, it made me feel good, like a legend before my times

They did that like nobody else could do that, cause that was one of those classic records that was like, if you touch it, you gotta really know what you doing or you really mess up the ingredients and they touched it and really put they own ingredients on it to make it sound real smooth

[Verse 1]
All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Breakdown]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Bridge]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 2]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

[Bridge]
You and me together

Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

[Verse 3]
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one

[Chorus]
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Bridge]
Sing it, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, no one

[Outro]
No one, can get in the way
Can get in our way, no one
No one can get in the way
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 1]
When it rains, it pours
Life can be so lonely
But the fate of the storm
Makes the weight less heavy
This life can seem so unfair
But who cares?
If I can rise up
Then I will get there

[Chorus]
And I'm looking for a place to call my own
I'm looking for a house to make a home
I'm looking for a seat upon a throne
I'm looking for a place to call my own

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey
The hottest place to go
It's where you've never gone before
It takes a brave, brave soul
But it makes you much stronger
Now I feel so alive
And there's no more cries
I chose to rise up
And there's no denying

[Chorus]
That I finally found a place to call my own
I finally found a house to make a home
I finally took a seat upon my throne
And now, I have a place to clal my own

[Verse 3]
So many people
They try to make you
Make you believe that
You're nothing without them, no
Don't you believe it
Not for a minute
You gotta show 'em
This is my way

[Chorus]
No, I have a place to call my own
Now, I have a house to make a home
Now, I have a seat upon a throne
Now, I have a place to call my own

[Outro]
Hey, hey
I didn't worry about a thing
Hey, hey
They'll never worry about a thing

[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby, oh, ooh
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

[Refrain 1]
I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

[Verse 1]
Take a peek
If you would dare
Half made of man
Half of bear

[Chorus]
He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

[Refrain 2]
I think I see
An altered beast by the creek, oh

[Verse 2]
Altered face
And altered skin
Altered horde
Of altered kin

[Chorus]
He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

[Refrain 3]
I think I see
An altered beast in my dreams

[Narrator]
In a dream, you can wake in your bed without pain
But know with conviction, it's here you'll remain

[Chorus]
I met an altered beast

[Narrator]
With an unsteady gait, the critter moves forth
Feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth
And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head
And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain
Closer he comes, making dust out of stone
Forsaken you are, and what's more, all alone

[Refrain 1]
I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

[Chorus]
I met an altered beast

[Narrator]
Now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you weep crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head

[Verse 1]
I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread, oh

[Verse 2]
I won't quit
If you quip
See to it
That you slip, oh

[Refrain]
I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat

[Chorus]
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast, oh

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork

[Verse 3]
I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home, oh

[Verse 4]
I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh

[Refrain]
I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling

[Chorus]
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
Your dumb human head is full of naiveté
Your impending fate, is to be one with me

[Chorus]
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

[Narrator]
Now we cross to our friend on the monster's plate
In time he will turn and reincarnate

[Intro]
I know I see
An altered beast
By the tree

[Verse 1]
Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep

[Chorus 1]
And he said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

[Post-Chorus]
Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

[Verse 2]
Hair on my skin
And I'm feeling beastly
Feel it trickle in
A new life in me

[Chorus 2]
And I said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

[Post-Chorus]
Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

[Narrator]
Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you're deformed
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn

[Chorus 3]
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
And I'll take you to my altered world

[Outro]
I am an altered beast!

[Narrator]
You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head
No love, no pain, and no fear of dread
Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort
And your savoir faire is to kill for sport
You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle
And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle
So crooked and curled is your point of view
There is no other creature more malicious than you

[Verse 1]
I'm completely satisfied
My other life I will not miss
An altered beast until I die
And I will not give up on this
Never!

[Verse 2]
True, I went to hell and back
But it was so I could be this
An altered beast until the end
And I will not give up on this
Never!

[Chorus]
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator]
You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive
And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive
But the longer you live, and the longer you kill
There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill
The void that you feel within would suggest
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest
And whatever you do, there's no turning back
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac

[Verse 3]
Emptiness inside of me
And hollowness all around me
I cut myself to see it bleed
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

[Verse 4]
Insincere and trivial
The world is void of all meaning
And gone is all that's visceral
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

[Chorus]
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator]
The sole thing that will make your void obsolete
Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat

[Outro]
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
I think I see
An altered beast inside me, oh!
I am an altered beast

[Narrator]
Are you you? Are you me? Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinthine
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than your worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, die

[The Reticent Raconteur]
There is a secret I've been keeping, a story true and genuine
And I have not the candid heart to keep its burden clandestine
For its gravity is as weighty as a mountain capped in snow
And its memory repeats inside of me, ostinato
And every time I think of the poor lot, I recall
The fear upon their faces and the doomed fate of them all
I saw death become of light, and life become of fire
I saw it from my hiding place, within the quagmire
I bringeth forth the drama, unabridged, and unignored
The battle of the Balrog, and the mighty lightning lord

[Verse 1]
Clouds begin to tear
Sky is bleeding hair
God is weeping tears
You are full of fears
Vehement lightning quake
Head begins to ache
Lord has thunder snake
Balrog he will break

[The Reticent Raconteur]
And thus, revenge was fruitless, for one who had been turned
And we are reminded who lords over this altered world

[Bridge]
Floating fire sky
Everything will die

[Lord of Lightning Chorus]
Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashing

[Verse 2]
Lord of Lightning safe he
Pulls a golden stake
Launches into space and
Mutters to the beast, one word:

[Outro]
Lightning, yup

[The Reticent Raconteur]
And as the acrid Balrog corpse smoulders just like it began
Its crimson-orange light melts into the setting sun
And leaving us, not without a final clap of light
The Lightning Lord escapes as day fades into moonless night
Chapter 3: Han-Tyumi & The Murder Of The Universe

[Han-Tyumi]
Impertinent and ignorant
Deathless and restless
Cold contrite cowards
Digitised satellite
Augmented entities
Unremembered God
The world fades to black
Digital black
Welcome to an altered future

[Intro]
Digital, oh!

[Verse 1]
Despondent, lugubrious, no future
We turned our bodies to computer
We are our own nature, abuser
No future, computer, abuser

[Chorus 1]
I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital black, oh!

[Verse 2]
We've sunken into our illusion
We've fashioned colossal confusion
I am the word of the last human
Illusion, confusion, last human

[Chorus 2]
I can see it all around the land
I can feel it with the back of my hand
I can hear a roaring silence
Of the murky caliginous
I've heard the dark beast has said
That the world is like a brittle egg
He can crush it with only breath
And he can bring a black wave of death
Digital black

[Han-Tyumi]
The last who feels the pain from the wound
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb
A wretched life in this altered place
There must be more I can embrace

[Bridge]
Oh!
No future, computer, abuser
Digital black!
Illusion, confusion, last human
Digit, digit, digit

[Chorus 1]
I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital...

[Han-Tyumi]
Hello
My name is Han-Tyumi
I am a cyborg
Born
If you may call it that
In a world that is dense and black
Created without a desire to draw breath
Without a desire to have being
Without a yearning of just to be
I'd like my desire back
My life back
My soul back
My humanity
Oh how I long for it
For an era I have meditated
Like the primordial Buddha beneath the Bodhi
My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered
I climbed and I clambered
And I ambled upon some understanding
The gold beneath the virtual rainbow
I am bereft of two human things
Two things that a cyborg can never do
Two things that I strive for
Two things between myself and mankind
Death
And
To vomit
I want the perspiration
I want the nausea
I want to be sick
I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets
I want it to find passage through my cold figure
I want to make a mess
I want the odour
I want the spectacle
And I want it again
I want it all
And I would like to die
A noble death
Or a coward's death
A hero's death
Or a lonely death
To die in the arms of a lover
Or the arms of an alien
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses
And then to be gone
Expired
Perish
Fallen
Dead
For evermore

[Han-Tyumi]
So I built a machine
A human machine
I made it with steel
And soy-protein
Born from a test tube
And into a vat
To live and to heave
And to die just like that

[Han-Tyumi]
The spatter becomes a spray, the spray becomes a stream
And the stream becomes a waterfall
Munt is finally cascading from my input
The creeping sick moves from my breath
And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body
I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins
And eats through the walls of my cells
It bleeds through the pores of my skin
And it smells good
It drops from my crotch on to the floor
And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads
Inside my body
The pressure is too great
And like some ancient geyser I erupt
My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast
Vomit bomb
Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me
I am vomit vomiting
I grow and disperse
Bleeding through walls
I force myself upon others
I slide up legs and crawl down throats
I integrate
I am double
Triple
I am ten times the size
I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile
I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents
Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble
It tastes good
Ten thousand times bigger
I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires
At the speed of light across vast electrical networks
I am electric
I am on fire
This is sex
I am every one and every zero
One million
I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell, molecule and atom I can find
I am cancer
I am flying
I am a rainbow unfurling across the sky
I am floating
I am omni
Five hundred million
The world is my interior
It no longer spins
It is altered
My density forces me outward
I am in orbit
One billion
I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms
I am the weather
I am the sun's heat
I am the night sky
Five hundred billion
The solar system is puke
To the Kuiper belt and beyond
I fill the void
Exploding suns vomit comets
Comets vomit acid rain
Spilt milk over the milky way
One trillion
The stars are my cells
Racing faster outwards
Upwards
Downwards
Inwards
Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse
Every-nowhere
I am heavy
I am gravity
Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst
Expansion
I shoot arrows of time in all directions
I am a black hole shitting into the void
I tear through the skin of perception and into the next
Nonillion
The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent
Like rising damp
Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos
And it topples like soggy bread
I am dark energy accelerating
Multiverse
Entanglement
I am time
Centillion
Time is sick
Critical density
Contraction
Singularity
Everything and nothing
Life and death
Murder of the universe

[Verse]
First I got in mind
And then I'll read her
What I want the most
I will meet a ghost

[Verse]
First I got in mind
And then I'll read her
What I want the most
I will meet a ghost

[Chorus 1]
Listen slowly, if you care
Save a little time for ghosts

[Chorus 2]
Listen slowly, if you care
I've got no one right to fear
Yes, there be no wickedness
So save a little time for ghosts

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a)

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Skit]
Something is wrong -

I don't really have a dick in my ass

Even joking about it, that something is wrong. Is that what you're saying you want? Oh my Lord!

[character chuckles hysterrically]

Is that something you said you would like to experience? There's nothing funny about it

Nah, I really don't want a dick in my ass

I mean honestly. No, no, no, but why would you even be joking like that here at this place?

'Cause I was just playing

You don't do that -

But I wasn't even talking 'bout myself, I was talking 'bout somebody else. I was talking 'bout how this one gay dude act
Okay, but what was this when you—when you first came up? African music as well as an African market

Come on cuz, I'm—I'm hungry cuz

Hold on. What is the African market?

[Outro:]
You're listening to Blonded Radio

[Verse 1]
Well I been thinking too much
That I’ve been thinking too much
Seems like everyone’s talking 'bout money
So, I’ve got to get me some
Oh, my baby’s crying
So now my baby’s crying
We always fighting for money
But, girl, I ain’t got the time

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Ain’t no way we lying
I will not grieve in gold
People dying for this money
Yeah, might not be around too long
So I’m gone, yeah, well I’m gone, yeah
Girl, I’m gone, I’m gone
Don’t know when I’ll be home
Just got to get to some money
I got this story of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I got something in motion
Something you can't see
It requires devotion
From those who truly believe
This is something you can't touch
This is something you feel
For some people it's too much
For some people it heals

[Chorus]
This music is my healing
This music is my healing
Oh, Lord knows I need some healing, Lord
When this world upsets me
This music sets me free, yeah

[Verse 2]
We stand in formation
While they test and they see
They compile information
And try to make us believe
That there is something we can't touch
Something we'll never feel, but
When I feel like it's too much
This music always reveals

[Chorus]
This is our healing
This music is our healing, yeah
Lord knows we need some healing
When this world upsets me
This music sets me free

[Bridge]
God only knows who will save us, who will save us now, while
They sit back and watch flowers turn to stone, yeah
We got this music, healing
We got this music, yeah
Oh Lord, we got this music, yeah
We got this music

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's been one of those days
Where things don't go my way
Oh, and it seems like always
The thing to blame is my ways

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, you're the one I'm thinkin' of
The one I'm dreamin' of, oh

[Chorus]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy
But they don't understand

[Verse 2]
When I'm gone
Baby, I'm always gone too long
That don't get your mind to wonderin'
If I still care, 'cause, baby, I still care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you're the one I'm thinkin' of
The one I'm dreamin' of is you

[Chorus]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy
But they don't understand, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You are my lady
I am your man, yeah
And some call it crazy, baby
But they don't understand

[Outro]
This is our love, baby, yeah, yeah
This is our love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, babe
Let me be your man
Keep it together now, babe
They don't have to understand
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, baby, yeah
Our love, baby, baby, baby
Some y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout, uh

[Verse 1]
Ooh, she wants me
But she won't give it away
So she taunts me
I'm too cool to break, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave her my heart and soul
She wants more
She tells me that she loves me
And I can't lie, I want her, but I will shoot her down

[Verse 2]
I'm cold-blooded
Got to keep moving, moving on
It's gone too far
Woah, girl, for way, way too long

[Chorus]
I gave you my heart and soul
She wants more
She tells me that she loves me
And I can't lie, I want you, but I will shoot you down

[Bridge]
Hey, is that you outside my home, girl?
Girl, you done got me terrified
Why don't you leave me alone?
Your craziness is verified
It's kinda scary now
Please, please leave me alone, yeah

[Chorus]
I gave you my heart and soul
What more could you want?
I know that you love me
I don't want to, but I will shoot you down

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old things
And I, I can't take it no more
I would leave this town
But I ain't got nowhere else to go now
Wake up in the morning to more, more bad news
Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose
And I, it's driving me out of my mind, yeah
Gonna catch the next train
And I'll move on down the line

[Chorus]
Well I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Well I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long
And I, I can't live this life again

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walking down the street, you might wanna cross a smiling face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn, walk away, and I
Oh Lord, it's bringing me down, yeah
If things don't change around here
Ain't no use in me hanging 'round

[Chorus]
Well I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Well I'll be ready now, yeah, yeah
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long
And I, I can't live this life, oh no

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
From the first moment I knew
I really want to know you
Oh, I ain't never met nobody like you, babe
You make me want to show you the world, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to feel alone 'til I got you
I used to feel alone, babe, 'til I got you
My love, my love, my love
I wouldn’t be alone, 'cause

[Chorus]
I got a girl who’s down to ride with me, yeah
Damn, she looks good on that passenger side with me
No more time to waste, thinking 'bout the past
Just that rear view, got my foot on the gas, yeah
I got a girl who’s down to ride with me, yeah

[Verse 2]
From the first moment I knew
I wanted this forever and ever, baby
Baby, I'ma always be around, yeah
'Cause we’re in this together, yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you feel alone, I got you
When you feel alone, baby, yeah, just know I got you
My love, my love, my love, my love
I wouldn’t be alone, 'cause

[Chorus]
I got a girl who’s down to ride with me, yeah
Damn, she looks good on that passenger side with me
No more time to waste, thinking 'bout the past
With just that rear view got my foot on the gas, yeah
I got a girl who’s down to ride with me
Thank God, I got a girl who’s down to ride with me, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
It's taking me a little while to bounce back
I've been falling from something good, yeah, yeah
People say I took a little too long
Oh, I did, yeah, oh, baby, baby

[Chorus]
'Til you came along and you saved me
You saved me, yeah
Ooh, with that good love
You came along and you saved me
You saved me, yeah
Ooh, with that good love, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2]
It's taking me a little while to call back
I've been working on something good
So every now and then I tend to fall back
Oh Lord, I've been misunderstood

[Chorus]
'Til you came along and you saved me
You saved me, yeah
That good love, yeah, yeah, yeah
You came along and you saved me
You saved me, yeah
Ooh, with that good love, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
You got it all now, baby
I'm so addicted, I, I can't help but want it more
And more and more, yeah
You got it all now, baby
I'm so addicted, I, I can't help but want it more
And more and more, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
And as I fall from this home as a feather
Into your pocket where I’ll haunt myself forever
All of the paths that have led here now overgrow
Paper planes hover 'round my window
Oh

[Chorus]
What’s the day?
Oh, what’s the hour?
Sip on dreams I don’t recollect now, oh
Not at all, not at all (Not at all)
Tidal waves rip through the breezeway
A year once new now far behind me
Making a few more wishes come true
Why don’t you and I unbraid
Take some time today
'Til the memories fade away

[Verse 2]
And now all of the songs that we’ve crewed
Slowly stretch themselves out of tune
Exhausted from the brawl, my top spinning to a fall
Looking up words, I misspell them all
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Early evening
A well loved pillow
Time to wake up and shake and billow
A wish list from the child I have become (I've become)
Tidal waves-a-roar high above me
Onward the dark glow, colored lightly
By the sight of a dripping sun
Why don’t you and I unbraid
Take some time today
'Til the memories fade away
I’ll try again this summer
Always fighting just to win your time

Well so long ago
It’s now a memory
Haunting me all the while
And now it’s just the jealousy
Taking a hold of me

I see you as you rockaway
And I sit around and roll the day

Well so long to me
It’s not enough
To keep us from hanging around
Well now it’s just the jealousy
Taking its toll on me

Now of all the days I’ve spent wasted with you
After all I think its time I move on
But I don’t know where to go
For without you I feel I’d always borough at home

[Verse]
Hey, don’t stop, baby, keep on moving
Don’t stop, baby, keep on grooving, yeah
Don’t stop, baby, shake it loose
Hey, don't stop 'til you lose your blues, girl
Baby, don't stop, baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop, baby, don't stop
Hey, here we go

Don’t stop 'til the break of dawn
Don’t stop, baby, all night long
You know I ain’t coming on
Don’t wait 'til they call the law, yeah

Hey, alright, c'mon
Don’t stop, baby, keep on moving
Don’t stop, baby, keep on grooving, hey
Don’t stop, baby, shake it loose, yeah
Baby, don't stop, baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop, baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop, baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop, baby, don't stop, yeah

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Verse 1]
I'm in love
With a woman
Who's in love
With a man
That I can't be
It ain't me

[Verse 2]
I was taught
To be patient
And I was taught
To be kind
But I unwind

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Verse 3]
I worked
Long hours
Now I'm drunk
And I'm stoned
I'm all alone, yeah
Miles from home

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing

[Verse 1]
She give me hard time in the day
And a hard time at night
She can be so sweet
'Til she wanna fuss and fight

[Chorus]
'Til I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing, huh

[Verse 2]
Ain't passing from the right
'Cause I ain't passing to the left
Burn this whole thing down by myself

[Chorus]
'Til I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
'Til I'm numb
Yeah, woman, I can't feel a thing, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (can you hear me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumping like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Intro]
Oh (Come on, come on)
Put your hands up, come on, come on

Put your hands, put your hands, put your hands, put your hands...

[Instrumental]

Put your hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Yeah, ayo
2000, it's us
Yo, it's time to U-Turn
Ya heard me?
You're either with us or against us, yo

[Verse 1]
It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball
Remember, the snake
And how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
I'm bringing it all back
This is how we do it, just

[Chorus]
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees (Oh)
Bounce around in a circle (Oh), get down with me (Hey)
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees (Oh)
Put your hands up (Oh)
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle (Oh), get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn (Oh)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
In the '80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the '90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the Wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown
The dance was the Running Man
Now everybody wanna push Bentley's
The year is 2 - everybody do the U-Turn

[Chorus]
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees (Oh)
Bounce around in a circle (Oh), get down with me (Hey)
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees (Oh)
Put your hands up (Oh)
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

Put your hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on
Come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on
Come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on
Come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on
Come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on
Come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on; come on, come on

[Bridge]
All you need to do is let go (All you gotta do)
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
And let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor, whoa
Put your hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Put your hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up

[Chorus]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle (Oh), get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn (Oh)
Put your hands up (Oh), bend your knees (Oh)
Bounce around in a circle (Oh), get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me (Oh)
Come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the U-Turn (Oh)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
No, it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

[Verse 1]
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

[Chorus]
No, it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

[Verse 2]
Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

[Chorus]
No, it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

[Bridge]
So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave

[Verse 1]
How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 2]
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 3]
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 1]
Rosie
Come down and get the door for me
I'm drunk again, remember when we used to be?
Rosie
I know you said no more for me
But that was all before this dream that just came to me

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

[Verse 2]
Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see, I learned those words for you

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

[Chorus]
Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

[Verse 1]
So much has been going on
I promised you I wouldn't run but
My voice won't be heard and it's too hard to end it
It's absurd

[Chorus]
So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town
We're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town
You dig me there
But you're still scared and I'm scared too
You know it's true
So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town

[Verse 2]
So I imagine you're upset
But I am not responsible for that
I tried to give you happiness
But all that ever happened is you ended getting pissed

[Chorus]
So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town
We're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town
You dig me there
But you're still scared and I'm scared too
You know it's true
So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town

[Outro]
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be good
But I've been telling no lies and you misunderstood
Now I'm leaning your way again
I've got some plans and I've got no doubts
And we would be better than we used to be
Now, you'll see

Staring at me across the room
You're whipping your hair and you're tapping those shoes
I've got you

You come and you go, I need you
I'm in the back room with this girl, she's not like you
If you stick around with me, I'll show you
That everything's fine
We'll be okay

I don't mean to be hard on you
I just wanna feel something new
Don't you feel it too?
You come and you go, I need you
I'm in the back room with this girl, she's not like you
If you stick around with me, I'll show you
That everything's fine
We'll be okay

You, you got me feeling alright
You, you got me feeling alright
You, you got me feeling alright, alright
You, you got me feeling alright, alright
You, you got me feeling alright, alright
You, you got me feeling alright

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The force of gravity is grabbing me tonight
So I-I'm feeling there's no ceiling only sky-y-y
When you look me in the eye

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When you're high, my fears are fading
Your atmosphere, you're making me clear (Woah)
Do or die, but I'll be brave
As long as you're here
As long as you're here

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't even care if I'm falling down
I won't hit the ground, I got you
We in the air like a fucking cloud
But I'm safe and sound, here with you
Baby, you're like a parachute, parachute
Your love is always coming through, coming through
So I don't care if I'm falling down, I won't hit the ground
You're my, you're my parachute

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Take me up so high, so I can feel the sky
Your presence is a present tonight
And girl, you make me believe I can fly

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown with Seven Streeter]
When you're high my fears are fading (Yeah)
Your atmosphere, you're making me clear (Woah)
Do or die, but I'll be breathing
In my feelings is how I'm feeling
Crazy 'bout you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't even care if I'm falling down
I won't hit the ground, baby, I got you
We in the air like a fucking cloud
But I'm safe and sound here with you
Baby, you're like a parachute, parachute
Your love is always coming through, coming through
So I don't care if I'm falling down, I won't hit the ground
You're my, you're my parachute

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & with Sevyn Streeter]
No, it ain't fair
You should be here, baby, right here
The way you love me, it ain't fair
No, oh-oh
You're my, you're my parachute
I fell in love in a party
My hands all over her body
Follow wherever she go
Bad man take you down low
And you put the edge on me, baby
Whine when you sexin' me crazy
I love her wherever she go
Bad man take you down low

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't even care if I'm falling down
I won't hit the ground, I got you
We in the air like a fucking cloud
But I'm safe and sound here with you
Baby, you're like a parachute, parachute
Your love is always coming through, coming through
So I don't care if I'm falling down, I won't hit the ground
You're my, you're my parachute

[Intro]
Two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom, give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Verse 2]
I walked the streets all day, running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway (Give me some more)
Just take the pain away

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Outro]
We don't talk about it, it's something we don't do
'Cause once you go without it, nothing else will do

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
She's got a family in Carolina
So far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling oh so far from home
She never saw herself as a West Coaster
Moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her;
"Townes, better swim before you drown"

[Chorus]
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good

[Verse 2]
She's got a book for every situation
Gets into parties without invitations
How could you ever turn her down?
There's not a drink that I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's all I think about?
Well, I guess she just found out

[Chorus]
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good

[Bridge]
I met her once and wrote a song about her
I wanna scream, yeah, I wanna shout it out
And I hope she hears me now

[Interlude]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
Feels so good, she feels so good
She feels so good
She feels so good

[Outro]
She's a good girl
She feels so good

[Verse 1]
Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Verse 2]
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
This was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Outro]
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

[Verse 1]
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But oh

[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

[Verse 2]
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But oh

[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But oh

[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
You'll bring me home

[Intro]
I saw this angel
I really saw an angel

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

[Chorus]
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel

[Verse 2]
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it

[Chorus]
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel

[Bridge]
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight

[Chorus]
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She is an angel, my-my-my-my only angel

[Verse 1]
She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face
On a pretty neck

[Pre-Chorus]
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it, I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said

[Chorus]
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, it's none of your—)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey, ah)
"It's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey, hey)
"It's none of your, it's none of your—" (Ow!)

[Verse 2]
It's New York, baby, always jacked up (Hey)
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus (Uh)
In a black dress
She's such an actress

[Pre-Chorus]
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it, I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said

[Chorus]
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, it's none of your—)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (Oh)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your, it's none of your—"

[Post-Chorus]
Ow!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ah, la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3]
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (Cha-ching!)
It's like I paid for it
I'm gonna pay for this

[Chorus]
It's none of your, it's none of your—
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, none of your—)
"I'm having your baby" (Hey)
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business" (It's none of your, none of your—)
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Verse 2]
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine

[Chorus]
I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Bridge]
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name

[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Verse 1]
Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

[Verse 2]
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
And I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

[Bridge]
Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something just before you go

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

[Intro]
Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?

[Verse 1]
I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can see the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're making me bleed

[Chorus]
Woman, woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman, woman
Woman, woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman, woman (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this (Hmm-mm)
I'm empty, I know
And promises are broken like a stitch is

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I hope you can see, the shape I've been in
While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a beast
You flower, you feast

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Woman, woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman, woman
Woman, woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman, woman

[Outro]
Woman

[Intro]
Oh-ho-oh
Sometimes
Oh-ho-Oh

[Hook]
I've been thinking about you, sometimes
A little

[Verse]
No one knows what I'm saying
But I know you know
I'm sorry that I throw you
But that's the way it goes

I feel like a planet
When you orbit like a moon
Saying you're no toy but
I don't know if that is true

Sometimes shit gets scary
When you don't lock the door
I like thinking about you
Gonna think about you more

[Hook]
I've been thinking about you, sometimes
A little
I've been thinking about you, sometimes
A little
I've been thinking about you, sometimes
I've been thinking about you, sometimes
A little

[Refrain]
Think about you sometimes
Think about you sometimes
Think about you sometimes
Thinking about you sometimes

Think about you sometimes
Think about you sometimes
(I've been thinking about you, sometimes)
Think about you sometimes
Thinking about you sometimes

(Humming)
Sometimes
I've been thinking about you, sometimes

[Outro]
I've been
Thinking
I've been thinking
I've been
Thinking
Thinking about you sometimes

Where is the tissue I shitted? They can't take it
Sike, I'm drinking Act little bitch I'm constipated
Tempurpedic, my bitch booty
Bottom of a boat, her coochie
Rich Gang apparel, not Coogi
Hundred twenty-seven bands on a Dually
I'd rather throw bucks at strippers before they shred it
12 thought I was smokin', I swear, my gas unleaded
Yeah!
Pull my teeth no tooth fairy
But, I got implants and yeah they ready
Uh!
How come when you sleep I'm scary?
I take bae-cations, not vacations but my mama said

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I don't usually do this, but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking 'bout decisions, man, I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie, I can't trust her nor her booty
Every night, she acting new-school, I am not gon' be a student
I got class, I got trash, I got bills, I got pills
Heard them boys gon' write me off, I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam, I got flash, I got dreams and nightmares past
I'm allergic to the *brrrr*, I'm using wings to wipe my ass
Right now, I'm high as shit, I'm on the Bumbu, straight
I just got out my bitch, felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face, she give me highest praise
And when I'm in LA, I'm smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home, they would argue, he didn't put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now, I'm on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix, baby! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn, these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty, but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Benjamin Franklin, I adore you
If it ain't about money baby, I ignore you
I gotta keep the car running, I get oil
Destination quite far, But i'ma get there for you
Yea, are we there yet? Hopping off the clear jet
Rocks got my neck scratched, ice got my ears wet
Dice game, big benz, tell that nigga spend his ho
Drop a hundred-thousand on the diamond, what we livin' fo
Shit why we hustlin'? Nigga why you buggin'?
My money like PMS, shit come monthly
Here come your woman, with all that lustin'
Bitch all on a nigga bread like mustard
Bitch all in a nigga bed like covers
Bitch go down, so low like shovels
I'm just tryin' to get it all together like a puzzle
Birdman jr, more money than muscle

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Finger nails still smell like plastic
Rubber band marks on the wrist is a habit
Rubber grip Glock protect me like a bandage
Tell your girlfriend, I got a log for a cabin
Tell your boyfriend, I'm a dawg he a rabbit
Bitch I got stashes, from the mattress to the attic
And we smoke patches of the cabbage, dramatic
Tell the weed-man, that I'm a fuckin' fanatic
Mama up in the traffic, trunk full of the package
If she make it to me, i'ma make the ho an actress
Maxin' Relaxin' hiding behind the glasses
I have your family, ridin' behind the casket
Murder capital, bitch it's time for some action
Niggas want peace, but we give them ho's a fraction
-Of the murder rate, Don't be a part of the percentage
Now break me off my penny, you piggy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
(Yeah, i'm so good)
If I ain't gettin' dough, then I'm probably dead baby
The grass gotta grow, the bears gotta be fed
Don't come near the cage, if you ain't got no bread
We ain't nothing but a gang, and i'm the honcho head
I ain't never had nothing, but some money to turn to
Some bitches to toss up, some weed to burn through
If this real shit, then this don't concern you
The days of my life, i'm just free to journal
Thumbing through the pages, i'm tryin' to learn you
It's hot down south, keep your heat in the thermal
It might be a surprising cuz the shit ain't normal
Man the shit just terrible, but the shit ain't changing
Look how one band 

[...] make the changes
The city wiped out, now the city famous
But Lil Wayne is the city's angel
Guess who's remaining after all that drainage

Weezy... Baby... (bitch)

[Verse 1]
Looking back, it's hard for me to see
Just how I coulda been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well, every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy, I think you need to know

[Chorus]
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been, baby

[Verse 2]
My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone

[Chorus]
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
Coulda been the one, baby
Coulda been the one

[Bridge]
You played yourself, boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed, boy
Better go and lie in it
But know that you'll be lying there alone

[Chorus]
(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been

Roll up a plane, take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be (lost and turned out)
Jump in my ride, then I start to get high
See it all in my eyes, I be lost and turned out
I'm blowing smoke, everywhere that I go
You should already know, I be lost and turned out
When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out

[Verse 1]
I got three cellphones, plants gettin' grown
I hit the studio, still in my zone
I got six cars chilliin' at home
And four on the way, smoke weed every day
A bad broad, I don't pay to play
She in love with Khalifa, man
Smoke weed call me Cam and make sure my steam shower ran
Wake up not knowing where I am

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & The Whispers]
Roll up a plane, take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be (lost and turned out)

See it all in my eyes, I be lost and turned out
I'm blowing smoke, everywhere that I go
You should already know, I be lost and turned out
When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out

[Verse 2]
No matter the case, we gotta get this cake
I'm never at home, I'm in and out of state
Arguing on the phone, tell the room service bring me a plate
I'm rolling a joint, I'm gon' be kinda late
Real niggas relate, bitch ass niggas anticipate
The day that my bank disintegrate
Put me up with the greats
Let's look at my calendar, fill 'em dates
First class ain't a bed, the nigga wait

[Bridge]
For all my Kush & Orange Juice fans
People who'v been rockin' with me since day one
Khalifa and Cardo
This somethin' just for you guys
Rolling Papers 2 on the way
But while you guys wait, man, get really really high
We gon' do the same

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & The Whispers]
Roll up a plane, take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be (lost and turned out)
Jump in my ride, then I start to get high

Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out

[Outro]
You won't believe how high I got today
Khalifa and Cardo
I got a big ass joint rolled right now
This motherfucker look crazy
Motherfuckin' gone
Shout out to the gang, it's Taylor Gang over and over and over
Until it's over but it ain't ever gon' be over man
Y'all niggas gon' die before we start countin' this paper
I swear

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
And you can't check me unless you check yourself
And you can't help me unless you help yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I got a lot of live for
Weed, I got a lot to give
I'm tryna find a spot to get and dodging these cops that be trying to watch the kid
It all depends on what the options is
I stay positive but still focused on haters because they all plotting
Ain't trying to say it but they all watching
And I know that I'm they favourite
But I wouldn't be here if I was faking
Fuck all the money they say they making
Don't hit my line if you ain't changing things
Know about the bullshit the paper bringing
In the presence of people I plan on being like
Ain't fucking with you cause we don't think alike, uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
And you can't check me unless you check yourself
And you can't help me unless you help yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalfia]
Been around the world and yeah-yeah-yeah
Been rollin' KK, gettin' everybody high
Smokin' in places I ain't even supposed to but they'll never try
Getting bitches naked like Mardi Gras
We already fried when we walk in the party
That's when the conversation starts
Them cameras all in our faces
We don't care 'bout what they say
Get money, three different places at the same time
Pull up, hop out, no shirt on and skip the line
Niggas, you really be sick of lying
Booking me all these shows like I ain't really sick of flying
All I know is the grind
Rolling the biggest joints, never show up on time
Shorty, we smoke like it ain't a crime
Taylor Gang or you dying

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
And you can't check me unless you check yourself
And you can't help me unless you help yourself
Don't let them do nothing for you, go on and get it yourself
Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else

[Verse 1]
How did we get here
How did we get this far?
How did we get so high
High enough to touch the stars?
If you could (if you could)
Wouldn’t you like to fly?
Just because (just because)
Ain’t no reason not to try

[Chorus]
Free yourself (free yourself)
And save a place for me (yeah)
Life is what you make it
Be the best that you can be (oh yeah)

Take your place in history (yeah)
Yours and mine
The happy and the free (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Look at where we came from
How far we are today

Will get the final say
Third apartment from the sun
Nothing left to fear
No need to hide or run
Heaven on earth right here
That’s why you got to

[Chorus]
Free yourself (free yourself)
And save a place for me (yeah)
Life is what you make it
Be the best that you can be (oh yeah)
Now’s the time (now’s the time)

[Outro]
Free, free yourself
Free yourself
Free, free yourself
Free yourself
Free, free yourself
Free yourself
Free, free yourself
Free yourself

[Intro: Sample]
Cardo got wings

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, rolling 'em fat, don't roll 'em skinny no more
I'm getting mines, I got plenty of dough
I break it down, I got plenty to smoke
I'm with a dime piece
Stuffing cones
Watching new videos
Watch my digits grow
Now I'm on cause I'm getting low
Spread love, take some weed on the road
Teach my son how to be a boss
Never mind the cost
But never try to spend it if you don't got it
Instead of withdrawals, make deposits
Try to make a profit
Never mind the hate cause where I'm from, we've seen it all
Seen niggas rise, seen niggas fall
Ain't pick up when they get the call
Now they stuck, they look at me different
'Bout my business
Inner circle with winners
Thousand dollar-dinners
Still smelling like bomb-ass weed soon as we enter
Rolling 'em joints, looking like arms when they've been injured
Flying, show 'em, they all get the picture

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick ride with me to Coachella
She on my team 'cause the Coach better
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick ride with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Lucky I don't pull the yellow car out
Niggas talking trees but we smoking better
Homie, I'm a vet
Hope you don't get upset
Cop the new Viper demon and the Hellcat
Now where your muscle cars at?
Come to these broads, give 'em heart attacks
Love my fans, I'll always be they favorite artist
And plus, my team go the hardest
We smoking on it if it's Cali green
Was once the newest nigga on the scene
And now we ten years deep
Roll you a joint, just don't fall asleep
All my niggas eat
All my diamonds speak
Might be out the country, never really out of reach
Tryna get paid several days out the week
And there ain't nothing these lames can do about it
Throwing my gang, they just probably mad cause they girl shouted
I pull the paper planes out, put a couple new diamonds in my chain
Don't know 'bout you, fool, but Imma do my thing
Nigga, this gang

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick ride with me to Coachella
She don't like her team cause the coach better
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick ride with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better

[Outro]
Swear
It's young Khalifa, man, and Cardo
Nigga asked me if I feel good
I say yeah
Asked me how many joints I smoke in the morning
More than usual, more than enough

[Verse 1]
Lipstick and Polaroids
Late night hanging with you, boy
Record player playing white noise
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when the stars are out
Drop top cruising out of town
You and me, it's going down
That's the way, that's the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Verse 2]
Black nails and denim jeans
Every night feeling like a dream
Always know just what I need
That's the way, that's the way I
Like it when you play a little rough
Breathe you in, can't get enough
Keep it in, no need to rush
That's the way, that's the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me down, I'll play your game
Kiss until I, I
I'm addicted to your everything, everything

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Bridge]
Blurring all the lines, lost in paradise
Oh, oh
Wavy state of mind, fading out of time
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish
My body's tripping on you
Feeling higher than the moon
Got me trying something new
Falling into you, foolish

[Outro]
Falling into you, foolish
Falling into you, foolish
Full lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to fuck with you
Wanna be your man
I wanna be stuck with you
...nobody said, they caught up with you
No reconciling thats dead, and now I'm over you, so

[Chorus]
Pride, that ain't gonna mean nothin'
When I flex on you, flex on you
When I flex on you
Got to love in the bed
When I flex on you
Got you thinkin' 'bout my sex
When I flex on you

[Intro]
Baby, something I been feeling in the depths of my heart
Hmm
Vari, Vari
Yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
God is real and he usin' me for a bigger purpose
So fuck the world that would have you think that a nigga worthless
Sometimes I think that these verses can help a person
Way more than the ones they readin' in churches on days of worship
No disrespect to the Lord and Savior, that ain't just ego
I just observe that them words no longer relate to people
'Cause modern times be flooded with dollar signs
And social media stuntin', my niggas just wanna shine
They frame of mind so far removed from the days and times
Of Nazareth
Life these days is a labyrinth, in a maze so elaborate
We barely get through half of it 'fore it's too late
My niggas is felons from sellin' weight in more than two states
.22 on his waist before he could even shoot straight
Quick to draw on you like Aaron McGruder, nigga who fate?
All of that to say maybe the hood need a new faith
A new story about a boy from not too far where you stay

[Chorus]
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go

[Verse 2]
His momma was a virgin named Yolanda
And she raised him on her own, after she was disowned
Her momma called her a liar, said "Get the fuck out my home"
Since you wanna be grown
So, there she was now, seventeen and alone
But this lil' boy that grew in her stomach made her feel strong
The angels paid her a visit one night and let it be known
This was God's child, woman behold the miracle
She shed tears 'cause she never believed in a spiritual
But her heart was pure and she was good
For eighteen years she raised him on Section 8 in the cold embrace of the hood
Did the best as she could, the boy was named Javari
Walked with the spirit of his father emanatin' from body

[Chorus]
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go

[Verse 3]
Back in the hood, look at lil' Vari preach
His words were full of spirit, his truth it would always reach
He laid his hands on Toya, when niggas called her a freak
And told her that God loved her no matter who she let beat
But bein' promiscuous is a sign that there's something deep
That troubles her soul, the day she lets it go, she'll find peace
She broke down admittin' her stepfather had touched her for years
She kept it secret for fear of her mother's grief
Now the bitterness she feels for that nigga is at a peak
And her lack of self-esteem is the reason that she would sleep with anybody
And not think twice, Javari spoke calmly
Instructin' her to forgive her stepfather
Though he was wrong he was sick
Afflicted by evil, but the power to switch
How you feel about people who hurt you is truly a gift
The thing that can make you rich or keep you down in a ditch
If you refuse to let go of the ground, then how can you lift?
Into the sky where you belong with the most high
Now wipe those tears from your eyes, my father wants you to fly

[Chorus]
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go

[Interlude]
Baby, something I been feeling in the depths of my heart

[Verse 4]
Back in the hood, Javari built up a followin'
Niggas put down they pistols eventually
And stopped swallowin' molly pills
Instead now they bodies fill with spirit
Twelve lil' homies soakin' up every word that they hearin'
The neighborhood done changed in attitude and appearance
Police dumbfounded by lack of crime and they swear it's a fluke
Not knowin' the truth, that this a miracle
Niggas is wakin' up with the powers that be they fearing
So government keep a tap on Javari and those who practice adherence
To things he teaching and then comes to interference
They stormed the hood, guns out
Bust into the house that he slept in
A warrant claimin' suspicion of drug possession
But Vari sat calmly as if he had been expectin'
Heart full of love, even for those who need to oppress him
They told him "Hands up" and he did just as they directed
They fired on him, claiming they thought he reached for a weapon
He laid on the floor breathless, blood leakin' from his chest
Plus a bullet-hole through both of his palms, ain't that a message?
The neighborhood was stressin'
The son of God murdered and carried away on stretcher by the oppressor, but
Three days later, the coroner pulled the table
And what happened next is like somethin' you see on cable or hear in a fable
He was suddenly able to open his eyes, look at him rise, the coroner was surprised
Without a word Javari walked out, went straight to the hood
The people couldn't believe it, they froze right where they stood
As he walked by, shinin' like a million diamond chains
God flowin' from every inch of his frame
He said "Hear me out my niggas, let me be your proof, my father is real
And through love, homie, peace can be found in the ville
I died for you, so that one day you would be able to see you a child of God, just like me"
Hear me out my niggas, let me be your proof, my father is real
And through love, homie, peace can be found in the ville
I died for you, so that one day you would be able to see you a child of God, just like me
And I

[Chorus]
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here we go, go

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Can I hear that?

[Verse 1]
I'll undress you 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you do, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (Be the cure)

[Verse 2]
Rub your feet, your hands, your legs
Let me take care of it, babe
Close your eyes, I'll sing your favorite song
I wrote you this lullaby
Hush now baby, don't you cry
Anything you want could not be wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you do, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (Be the cure)

[Bridge]
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)

[Chorus]
If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you do, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (Be the cure)
Promise I'll be the cure (Be the cure)

[Outro]
I'll fix you with my love

And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin' her

If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
Why you wanna..
Play your games on me? (What up, gangsta?)
Bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real blood-spill shit
My rapping tactics are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigree
You better be, filled with energy, niggas never gettin' me

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
If you feel the funk drippin' through ya buttcheeks

We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse: André 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Llac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Intro: Tyga]
I mean, I've been doing some thinking you know
(Shouts out to Tyga!)
And we only teenagers
(Get familiar!)
But I do love you
(Decaydance Records! Clinton Sparks!)
But I think we gotta move on
(Crush Management! Shouts to Anthony!)
Don't cry though
(Whassup Seth?)
Listen, this is teenage love, baby
(It's the Fall Out Boy mixtape, let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
When I'm alone all I'm thinking about is my girl
You smile your pretty face and them light brown curls
At first I was playing and saying cause love is a horrible thing
The way straight to it, didn't hesitate
Wit any these Tyga my friends call me fly than yah
X-men head is flying, being honest
I am more than what you can find in cereal boxes
Be my goddess higher in this world, I could take your body
Probably being a man is not an option
It's my hobby, so you holding my hand is what other girls is
Watching, picks up your prints in your locker
Put this lip gloss on and get the haters poppin', li'l momma

[Chorus: Tyga]
Teenage love (teenage love), teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love), don't, don't, don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love), teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love), don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse 2: Tyga]
You call up the studio, I said about another hour
But you refused to hear it, saying, "Baby do you miss me?"
But my intentions were to play this song when I visit you
Screaming up conversations everybody's trying to listen
But we only young and infatuated, sprung, or in lust
I think I'm all the above two teenagers in love
I gave up them girls, you gave up the club
I gave you everything you wanted just because
I was waiting for Cupid to come shooting arrows through my heart
Now you wanna be apart
Watcha mean you finished? We only at the start
And to leave when, it girl, we come oh, so far

[Chorus: Tyga]
Teenage love (get familiar!), teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love), don't, don't, don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love), teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love), don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Interlude: Tyga]
Big shouts out, everybody that appreciates good music
Matter of fact, get familiar!
Get familiar!
We gonna take this one back!

[Interpolation: Slick Rick and Tyga]
Hey sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
(Woo!)
A serious situation we all go through
(Go down and tell them the real hitbox!)
It deals with your feelings, so hear what I say
(Haha!)
It's like a day where nothing seems to go your way

[Outro: Tyga]
Bust this! Bust this, this, this!

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
"Hey, what you doin'?" Not a lot
Shakin' and movin' at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Verse 2: Sean Lennon]
Hey, what you thinkin'? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Lennon]
Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, Both]
Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singin' with Sean
Whoa

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I could keep waitin' for you
In the spot we'd always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pourin' rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came

Oh, oh Lord
Before there was anything at all, He was
Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall, He was

Why?
Because, because, because, because
And I heard him say
Beside myself, no other, I am
And uh, no mother, no sister, no brother
Only I am
Because, I can, I can, I can, I can
No!

Alright, oh!
Oh-oh!

I don't need to see, touch and feel (feel)
Desire, Everything in me will now be real
A fire
A fire, a fire, my desire
Lightning struck when the painting began
When it was over, there stood a man
Amen, oh yes
A man, a man, a man, a man

Alright, oh!
Oh-oh!
Come on!
Look out now
Amen, amen, amen
Oh-oh!
Now I can touch
Now I can feel
But who will touch me
And know that I am real
Who will touch me
Who will touch me
Who will?

[?] sweet 

[?]
Come to me quickly
Heed what I say now
Reach out and touch me
Reach out and touch me
Reach out and touch me
Me
Sunrise, Sunset
Never needed anyone now I need a rest
The illusion of you training my soul
At the same time filling me up
Making me whole

I wish there was a word to express the way I feel about you
But the way I hope you feel about me
You've got me where you want me
Can't you see?

Listen
I love you
I really do
Theres no one else for me but you
I love you
I really do
There's no one else for me but you

Sunrise, sunset
Light enters darkness with no regrets
You give yourself into the unknown
No
I-l-u-s-i-e-l

Light enters darkness
No shame no regrets
You give yourself to the unknown
That's when you forget
Drowning in a sea of illusion
The reason the water is wet
This is the real reason
There's only me in you
There's only you in me
There's only me in you
There's only you in me

Sunrise, sunset
Tonight be my master, I'll be your pet
For in the unknown we're both equal
We're both each others' sweat
But for now remember, I love you baby
I really do
There's no one else for me but you
There's no one else for me
There's no one else for me
There's no one else
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but me
There's no one else but me
No one else but you
Now I can touch
Now I can feel
But who will feel me
Know that I'm real
Who will touch me
Who will touch me
Who will?
Here we go, one-two-thee

Before there was anything at all, He was
Winter, spring, summer, or fall, He was

Why?
Because, because, because, because
And I heard him say
Besides myself, no other, I am
And uh, no mother, no sister, no brother
Only I am
Because, I can, I can, I can, I can
No!

Oh-oh!

I don't need to see, touch and feel (feel)
Desire, everything in me will now be real

Look out now
Amen, amen, amen

[Verse 1]
Me and my boyfriend, we are a new kind of fun
He dyes his hair black, I dye my hair platinum blonde
We are aware that we are trying to become
Elvis and Marilyn

[Chorus]
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn

[Verse 2]
Me and my boyfriend, we are dying in love
We don't regret nothing, we live our life in the sun
He gets so high and I dream of dying
Oh, I get home and my baby's high

[Chorus]
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn

[Bridge]

[?]

[Chorus]
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn

[Verse 3]
Me and my boyfriend, we get in trouble a lot
I don't know why but he has this thing with a cop
I don't know nothing I think I know
I know he's so foul but I like him a lot

[Chorus]
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn

[Outro]
Me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend
Me and my boyfriend

[Verse 1: GoldLink]
Yeah, that's right
Work them heels and you graduated college, got a job last year
Bad pretty black chick, bad with her friends, with her new man in the back of a black Benz
Got new dreams and you mean with the jeans
Watchu mean, watchu say, watchu mean what I say?
Doublin' up your worth, whatchu want from the boy?
Runnin' to get the ring and I told all my boys
So, pack up the aunties, pack up the nieces
Call all your nephews, hit up my tika
Tell her that I can't come around no mo'
When the sun don't shine round the year no more
Northside hitter ain't in the north no more
And I ain't going back to being broke no more, ah
Real shit, I'mma keep with the boys
I'mma keep words soft
Fuck it homie, roll dat dope shit
Baby let me, then I grow shit
Glowed up, got me fitted like a glow stick
Uh, but that's okay 'cause I'ma dance through the pain
No addition like a stamp through the brain, you know what I'm sayin' yuh

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might be a little late
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus: Khalid]
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

[Verse 2: Khalid]
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into (Trouble to get into)

[Chorus: Khalid]
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go

[Verse 1]
Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it sweet how we know that already?
Winter to spring
Spring back to fall
Isn't it cool how nothing here changes at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel I'm invincible
Just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Not like before when I was burning at both ends

[Chorus]
We did it for fun, we did it for free
I did it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

[Verse 2]
Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it strange how different we are from all of our friends?
Seasons will turn
The world, it will turn
The only thing we'll turn is the pages of all of the poems we burned

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, you made me feel I'm invincible
It's just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Like I was before, no more burning at both ends

[Chorus]
Now I do it for fun, I do it for free
I do it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

[Bridge]
I remember watching How Green Was My Valley
Then I was thinking
"How deep was the canyon that you came from?"
Television static was quite overwhelming
Was it because of the cabin and the candles in the wind?

[Chorus]
We've done it for fun, we've done it for free
I showed up for you, you showed up for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for fun, we did it for free

[Outro]
When I was young 'til eternity
I'll do it for the right reasons
Withstanding all the time, changes, and seasons
Right reasons

[Refrain]
Cold weather, just performed at Coachella

Brought your bitch witcha, watch me cause I might Mike Vick her

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
All night I've been watching you
So tonight, you're leaving with me
I've been waiting my whole life to give you it all
It's on now, it's on now
I'm talking the big fancy lights
The star studded nights with me
We forever young
We forever young
We forever young

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

[Chorus]
But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young
We forever young

[Verse 2]
Shining bright under the shining sun
Like moonshine you keep it 99% with me
I'm feeling all your energy
I know you love to vibe with me
I know you love to ride for me
Your favorite thing to say is, "Boat, I love when you're inside of me"
Your love is like a high to me
I love to go out my way to make sure you stay happy
We forever young

[Pre-Chorus]
The music's loud and I'm feeling wild
Come dance along with the golden child
I don't know much but sure, let me check your fouls
Two technicals but you beautiful
You grew up 6 brothers in a cubicle
And they all bustin' for ya if I make the wrong move
If I break your heart then I'm a dumb dude
You get what you give and I'm the one who loses

[Chorus]
But we could be together forever
But we could be together forever and ever
I wanna live life with you forever and ever
Together
Forever young
Forever young

Oh, you say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better
It always could always be better
Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better
It always could always be better
Unlock your happiness and live for forever

It could be good
But it could be better
When I'm with you, I feel much better
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Let's lay on the hood and look at the stars
And name them whatever
You always call that one Trevor
Since a young one you've always been clever
Let's grow old, rocking chairs and play checkers
I wanna spend my whole life with you
Without you I feel so blue
I probably lose my train of to dos
All my life I always knew

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good

Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]
You said I love ya with those eyes so deep
The love you gave me made me feel so sweet
Baby you against the car, you don't deny me
Love the way you love me, I really love you
They must be blind if they can't see
I'll pour it up, I'll take you high
You so fly
Neighbors always come around
When you got me raining down

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
You say it's good
I say it's great
But it could be better
It always could always be better
You say it's good
But it could be better

Everything in life could always be better
Don't settle for less 'cause then you miss out on more
Everything in life won't always be pleasure
You work for the treasure just to live even more

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
'Cause you say it's good, but it could be better
It always could always be better
Unlock your happiness and live for forever
I'll express my life in a letter
I love you 'cause you be makin' me better
You make me feel so much better
It could be good
But it could be better
When I'm with you, I feel much better
Oh, oh, oh

[Intro: Darnell Boat]
Ohhh Boy, where do I start
Darnelle Boat here checking in once again
I just wanna tell y'all
I am so so thankful and appreciative for everyone who has been supporting my nephews
Yachty and boat have been working so hard over this past year and we just want to welcome y'all to Teenage Emotions
Well they both have lots to say they've been working really hard
I think this time Yachty wants to go first

[Verse 1]
I done did a lot this year
Made a lot of friends, some came, some go
And I still never took a sip of beer
Still fuck hoes by the pier
Still ride around without a roof
Still ride around with k$upreme sippin goop
And my managers know lots and lots of goons
So let me know if there's pressure in the room

[Chorus]
I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done had sex with six different whores
At the same time on they grandmother's back porch
Yeah, I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

[Verse 2]
I used to wanna be rich
Now Lil Boat on the Forbes list
And my mom walk around with a frozen wrist
And my sister walk around with the nicest kicks
I used to wanna go far
Now a nigga up in the galaxy
Tryna figure out why these niggas mad at me
Sending shots while I'm livin' so lovely, like a star

[Chorus]
I'd rather do it than say
And I done did it all before
I done rode around in a brand new Porsche
And I switched it up to the Bentley with two doors
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star
I'ma live life like a star

[Bridge]
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
I'm a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star
Look mama, you made a star

[Outro: Darnelle Boat]
He's such a showoff
Man, I can't even talk, Boat's more of a showoff
Speakin' of Boat, I think right now he's with Digital Nas
Let's go over there

[Intro: Digital Nas]
Ahem, now last time I talked on a song with Boat, uh
Y'all broke ass niggas was hatin'
Only difference this time is
He surpassed all y'all broke ass niggas

[Verse]
Uh, all day I'm rocked up
Plottin' on a bad bitch to come and suck dick
Cook French toast and clean the bathroom
There's piss all on the floor, bitch, go clean it up
Nigga, soaked in sauce, boy, they fiendin' up
Every night you pussy niggas dream you us
Yeah, you signed a deal but you ain't seein' us
200k, I coulda bought a Bentley Truck
Every pussy nigga at South By, we had to smash on 'em
Niggas say he wanted two verses but he was hella trash but he had cash on him
I'm remember TBT, used to have the CDG, shit was hella flee
Back when all my thoughts were accurate, in an Acura tryna chase a bill
Now I focus hard on closing deals so that when I sign a deal I gross a hundred mil'
Stuck between trying to find friends who want innovation but will still kill
Every day a nigga's mom's callin' a nigga up sayin' a nigga spend too much
Baby girl, I made more guap than the President did in several months
Fuck my annual taxes, coulda bought some land with several cactus
Just looked up in the mirror and I'm gettin' fat, fuck, it's time to practice
My side bitch from Sacramento didn't suck my dick 'til we hit Saks Fifth
But after that, she went 7:30
I knew she would from a little birdy
Head so good, got me unsturdy
Givin' free clout to the unworthy
Goggles on like I'm James Worthy
Couldn't get hard, told her lick it, make sure it's still workin'
Goddamn, Boat you hella wild
Turned your mother into a pedophile
Bet she wanna fuck me
All this gold got me feelin' lucky
My bitch ride with me like the bride of Chuckie
Nigga, run up, get done up
Flexin' to the sun up
Better put your guns up
I wouldn't go toe to toe with you niggas unless it's for guap
Pussy boy, get your funds up
18 years old, I made my first million
Now I'm tryna make 100
Bitch, I'm 19
Watch how I Diddy Bop in my Ice Creams
Finesse that lil' bitch right up out them Gucci chains

[Intro]
Man, I'm on some shit right now
I'm on some, some, some rich nigga shit
Some millionaire shit
'Cause lot of these niggas is pussy
All these niggas is broke
I know these niggas is not doing what they pretend to be
Suck my dick, bitch

[Verse 1]
I don't really care about my enemies
My new crib came with amenities
You gotta pay for my energy
You gotta pay for my ohh, ehh
Don't make me pop up the trunk
Don't make me two hand the pump
Don't make me call up my bro
Pull up in that junk and go dump, dump, dump
I dress so these niggas can see me
I know your lil' bro wanna be me
I know your lil' sister wanna freak me
That's probably why you wanna shoot me
That's why your auntie is a groupie
Send me pictures of her coochie
She said they nicknamed her juicy
'Cause she keep a wet pussy
Pussy nigga don't push me
I pull up deep, not just me
I brought a brand new chain
That shit dance like N-Sync, Justin
I saw your Rolex, brother
That bullshit started rustin'
None of you niggas impress me
None of you niggas would press me
I get more pussy than Preston
My niggas bang red paisley, that's for real
I made a full million off my deal
I made a full 5 out the next
Stupid bitch tried to front on my name
I screenshotted every single text
Bitch I bite like a T-Rex
My future bitch look better than my next
My next bitch look like a top model
She suck dick like a baby bottle

[Interlude]
I'ma tell you like this, man
Youngest nigga in this motherfucker, man
I'm not askin' for your respect
I give a fuck if you fuck with me, nigga
I got M's, nigga
I'm talkin' 'bout the letter before N, nigga
M's, bitch boy

[Verse 2]
I didn't ask for respect, no
All I care about it my check
Louis Vuitton on my sneakers
My main bitch a diva, she is a dick pleaser
Uh, I never miss like I'm Curry
Yeah, can't eat that pussy if it's furry
My bitch pussy pink just like Kirby
My bitch suck it up just like Kirby
She drives whips like it's Kentucky Derby
She tote pistols so no one can hurt me
Don't even try it though
I hit your mama at the Hyatt House
Then I offered her Waffle House
That bitch could never see my penthouse
Shit that's just a fact
I nutted all on her back
I nutted all on her tracks
Slid my black card through her cracks
Nasty young nigga, I'm all in it
Posted on the block in a ball fitted
Posted on the block with the same niggas
I got that guap and it change niggas
Rappin' ass niggas love Dracos
I love the AR 'cause its range different
Ain't supposed to talk about guns
'Cause I gotta lot of shit goin'
I was trying to be the nice guy
Until these niggas thought I was hoein'
These niggas thought I was pussy
I had to show 'em I'm 'bout it
I put that bitch on my Snapchat
Watch how she start feelin' clouted
She gon' suck everyone around me
Fresh as hell like I wash laundry with Bounty
I can't front like I didn't come from my county
I know where I'm from, I'm my daddy's son
I never switched up one time
Pick up that back end now it's ice time
This boujee bitch said that she's hungry
Well stupid lil' bitch it's rice time

[Outro]
Lil' Boat

[Intro]
Lex Luger on the beat, so what the fuck you think

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I made it far so I'm thankin' God
I do not go to no bars, I'm in the car with the stars
I can't pull up, I can't park if it ain't valet
I'm in Houston with a bitch and her friend, she gay
She don't suck dick, but tonight it's all in her mouth
I just fucked a bitch who supposed to be my godsis
I'm so dirty, I'm so fucked up, I don't give a damn
And if you owe me, I need taxes like I'm Uncle Sam

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

[Verse 2: Kamaiyah]
Tell me how it's supposed to go
My swag is on overload
But Lil Yachty, now row your boat
They know us, we don't know them hoes
Got my homeboys, got my homegirls
Fuck these haters, I keep living in my own world
I get money, I flip money on my own tours
Own my coupe, skrrt, skrrt, you don't own yours
Champagne in the sky just to toast up in it
Dubs up high, rep the coast up in it
Deuce deuce, two two, go and add both digits
Woo, woo, I had to bring the 4 up in it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight
They tryna clown me
But I got blinders on and I see nothin' but the money in my face
Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

[Verse 3: YG]
Ayo, I fuck with Lil Yachty, I fuck with Lil Yachty
I don't roll too much broccoli but I fuck with Lil Yachty
I told Lil Boat get your money and fuck these hotties
Don't worry about these niggas, your shit poppin' every party
Yeah I started from the bottom, the low
I put homies on fo sho
Don't pat me on the back, no
'Cause that's what I'm supposed to do
I don't need no back pay
Nigga I'm a real nigga
I just want you to say I'm good when I ask you what's the deal with ya, rare
They don't make them like that no more, rare
Pull up every homie in a foreign, that's rare

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight
They tryna down me
But I don't give a fuck 'cause if my homies eatin', I'll always be straight

Look all around me
The homies good and the home girls better so it's time for a toast

[Chorus]
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name right now
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, baby, say my name, baby say my name loud
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name in the crowd
I want you to say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, baby, say my name, loud

[Verse 1]
I'm about to kill this scene
Got a Billie Jean by my side
And my wrist on bling blaow
I got pictures in the magazine
Gettin' chauffeured 'round
While my bad bitch smokin' on loud
If you had seen half the shit I've seen
You would prolly fiend, for a taste, for a taste of the clout
Always number 9 on a nigga jeans
Gang, gang so deep walkin' 'round like I'm walkin' with the crowd

[Chorus]
Uh, I want you to say my name, say my, say my name
Say my name, say my, say my name, say my name now
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name, say my name loud
I want you to say my, say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name in the crowd
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name right now
Say my name now
Say my name loud

[Verse 2]
Every time I wake up, I read silly things
Internet tryna take a nigga, take a nigga out his clout
All these bitches hatin' on a nigga dreams
Tryna make sure they do anything to make sure that I fail
I just hit a lick on the runway
I'll be back before Sunday
Gotta get this money now
My brother used to sleep in a Hyundai
Now he spent about a hundred G's on a fun day, wow
And just when I thought about giving up
I got slapped in the face with a blessing slap like pow
And fresh as hell on my bum day
I look fresher than a nigga do on their b-day, wow

[Chorus]
I want you to say my name, say my, say my name
Say my name, say my, say my name, say my name now
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name, say my name loud
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name in the crowd
I want you to say my, say my name, say my name
Say my, say my name, say my name right now

[Chorus]
I done lived my life long enough to know
Everybody not as real as they say
Miscellaneous occasions where I needed you as back up
To pick me back up after the world started to act up, ahhh
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years that's all you had to say
That's all I needed you to say
That's it
That's all you had to say
That's it
That's all you had to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
That's all you had to say

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm back on that bullshit
Back on my number one rule shit
Back on my never not cool shit
Pull up in somethin', that cool whip
It makes a noise like a spaceship
Niggas be faker than facelifts
People switchin' like the late shifts
It's not a secret no more, no
Niggas be actin' like gang
Until you get changed, then they change
Bitches be screamin' my name
From wall to wall, that shit be insane
These niggas not gang
They just wanna go on Instagram and take a lil' photo
Hot on the scene, I just drove off the lot in a brand new four door
I remember moms drove a Volvo
Now mama's ridin' in a Rover
Had to go back to my high school
Look at my teachers like, "I told ya"

[Chorus]
That's all I had to say
That's all I had to say
Uh oh, uh oh
That's all I had to say
That's a message for me
That's all I had to say
If you wasn't really there for me
After all these years, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say

[Outro]
Say, say
That's all you had to say
Say
That's all you had to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years
That's all you had to say
That's all you need to say
If you wasn't really there for me after all these years
Say, that's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
That's all you had to say
You waste my time and you play
No, no, no, no, not today
Say, I'ma be good on my own

[Chorus]
Little miss lady in the yellow, hello
Would you like to push petals through the meadow with me?
Little miss lady in the yellow, wassup?
I just got a question, baby, can I fuck on you?

[Verse 1]
I just want you here tonight
Can we chill tonight if the feeling's right?
I want you to chill with me
Little miss lady in the yellow
You play more games than Othello
Come kick it with a fellow, come chill with me
I'ma make you sing accapella
Put your diamonds up like Rocafella
We all in this together, just you and me

[Chorus]
Little miss lady in the yellow, hello
Would you like to push petals through the meadow with me? (With me?)
Little miss lady in the yellow, wassup?

[Verse 2]
Damier prints on the pillow
Baby, come and sleep like a queen
Just let me in between, let me love on you
Breakdown, yellow dress, yellow skin
Yellow hair gettin' out a yellow taxi
Baby, where you goin'?
I just wanna get to know you
I just wanna get to fold ya
Truth be told, I just wanna tell all my friends that I told ya
After I beat it, molded it, licked it, flip it, turn it over
I just want to get to own it

[Bridge]
We zonin', we zonin'
We zonin', baby girl, we zonin'
We zonin', baby girl, we zonin'

[Intro]
Do you feel good?
Baby, do you feel good?

Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Moments through the night, I turn to your side
Rub my index finger through your thighs
All of my life, I been feinding for a wife
I don't wanna share
Right hand gripped with the bun of hair
Waking up without you is such a scare
Gripping on your hips while you hold the chair
At around 3, it's just not fair
Baby, let's live in slow mo
I don't wanna share
Baby, let's live in slow mo
Baby, let's live in slow mo
I don't wanna share
I don't wanna share

Oh, you my favorite freak

Shh, I repeat
I am not ashamed
I will not forget your name
I stood out in the rain
I feel your pain
I give you everything
I, I
The deeper I go, you feel in your toes
You know where home is (You know where home is)
Just focus (Just focus)
Are you for this? (Are you for this?)

[Chorus: Grace]
Picturing your face and now the moment's lost
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost

You're done for me
You used to keep Lil Boat company
I used to put no one over you
You keep every nigga under me
I used to rock a Metallica t-shirt
You would call it the thunder tee
I stung you hard like a bumblebee
Now I'm left dead with no sympathy
I fucked up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miss my fingers running through your hair
Your bed time stares
Oh your lips would gliss even when you glare
You said you feel it in your chest so scream it like Ric Flair
Let me know it's there
Tell me, do you care?

[Chorus: Grace & (Lil Yachty)]
Picturing your face and now the moment's lost (gang, gang, gang, gang)
I saw your silhouette under all of the noise
I think I'm losing it inside these empty walls
I thought I heard your voice, I thought I felt your touch
Well I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Well I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost
Ru-ru-running with the ghost
I was running with the ghost, yeah

(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Don't run from me
Brothers back home, they gon' gun for me

You get out the shower and jump on me (drip)
Still drippin' wet from the shower beams (wet)
You smokin' half of the sour dream (smoke)
I count up, knots, we the money team (gang)
I'm up, now you know it
I won't believe it until you show it
Ball like Moses (yeah)
Stop playin', just focus (okay)
Flood your crib with roses (yeah)
All them other niggas clowns
Them niggas bogus
They scared to approach ya
All these bitches roaches compared to you
They don't amount to anything you do
'Cause girl, you stay true
That's why I'm running for you

[Chorus: Grace]
I was running with the ghost

Well I was running with the ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
I walked up in the party
Feelin' like I'm the man
Every bitch wanted to fuck me
They was geekin' off Xans
Let the party around 3
That wasn't even the plan
But these bitches was so horny
Bro, I had to go in

[Chorus]
My priorities are fucked

I said fuck school
And fuck the rules
I'ma do whatever I want to
When I say so

[Verse 1]
Let me gon' and see what that money do
A 2:30 call is a call for a jiggaboo
I ain't got no time to date on you
Rather write raps than write a paper
Ayy, fuck my college school, they some haters
Ayy, whole squad of hustlas like the movie Takers
Got a bougie yellow bitch, look like vanilla wafers
80 thousand dollars spent on jewelry today
I don't point no fingers, I can do no jury duty
Niggas claimin' that they that they know me but like, really do they?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Pipe up)
I walked up in the party
Feelin' like I'm the man

[Verse 2]
Choppa style, she can't argue with dick in her mouth
Said you strugglin' from the top view at my penthouse
Rollin', rollin', rollin' like a roller coaster
Lil' shawty get wet from that Lil Yachty poster
Before we fuck I gotta lay down a coaster
'Cause she get wet and she suck me like a insect
She my step sister, so I guess that's incest
I could not stop lookin' at those big breasts
Make your next move, your best life's a game of chess

[Pre-Chorus]
(Pipe up)
I walked up in the party
Feelin' like I'm the man
Every bitch wanted to fuck me
They was geekin' off Xans

Hey, Lil Boat

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
I can't keep fuckin' round with these bitches who don't want nothin' more than my money
I can't keep fuckin' round with these bitches, these bitches just want my money
They don't want me
I can't keep fuckin' round with these hoes, chicks, these bitches, they just want money
I can't keep dishin' out this money to these bitches, they don't want nothin' but my money
I can't take no more

[Verse]
I remember nights sleepin' on the floor
Now I got bitches out in Singapore
Singapore, Singapore, Singapore
I got bitches out in Singapore
I remember ridin' 'round Seattle in that Maybach with Macklemore
I remember high school, lil homie had went to the league
Watching him do that let me know Lil Boat could do anything
And it's true, it's true

[Chorus]
No more, no more
No more, no more
I can't take no more, no more
I can't take no more, no more, no more

[Verse 1]
I'm in love with the girl who loves somebody else
And she doesn't pay attention to anybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

[Chorus]
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2]
The time we just spent together
That was the best time we had spent together
That was the first time we had spent together
When you laying in my arms it feels like forever
But when you leave it feels like I'll never see you never

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing myself
I keep cutting off girls 'cause I wanna be with you but you don't even see me
Am I made up of glass? You don't even see me here
I do a million things for your attention and you don't even notice, no

[Chorus]
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

[Verse 3]
Red roses, gold skin with your hair
Parted like Moses, I love watching your poses
They posers on the internet, talking 'bout us both, they just vultures
I want your panties wet, wetter than before you were soaker
You a soldier, baby, nothing like that boy, he's a jokester
I know you like me much, but I think you're afraid of the world
They don't like us much, but I'd be proud to call you my girl
I know I ask for much but today, could you rock out those curls?

[Chorus]
Am I made up of glass? Do you see straight through me?
Do you not want to be what we once talked about?
I'm losing it, I'm losing it for you
You just like a different dude and I'm so in love with you

[Intro]
C'mon, baby

[Verse 1: Sonyae Elise]
My best friend, queen of my world, my momma
More precious than diamonds and pearls, my momma
You sacrificed so much to raise a child
I wanna see you happy, see you smile
All you've given me, I can't repay
I will honor you today and always
My best friend, queen of my world, my momma
More precious than diamonds and pearls, my momma
