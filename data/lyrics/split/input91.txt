Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you ever gonna see him give 'em Kanye's best
Uh, They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)

But he can’t just seem to get Kanye fresh

Money, money, money, money, money

[Verse 1]
Niggas don’t move like the gang (Rama)
I know hood niggas, who be countin' big change
I know broke niggas, who plot on the rich (Rich)
Always talkin' bout a lick, but never hit because they bitch
Momma, I know niggas think that I'm a stain (Ha-ha)

But I know nobody stolе it, they ain't stupid (But)
Slide up on an AR pistol, it go stupid (Pee, pew, pеw)

[Chorus]
Money stacked tall, like Mutombo (Gula)
Get it in the morning like Alanzo

[Chorus]
Money stacked tall, like Mutombo (Gula)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Let me know, ohh, ohh

It’s Lil Boat

[Intro]
(EarlOnTheBeat)
It’s been a minute since I goddamn opened up
I had to get back in this bitch, broke it down, ya feel me

[Verse]
My bitch is a brand new Jem
I promise I'm nun' like them
I bang with the 5”9' Brims (Frrd)
I travel through darkness for wins
I used to survive off Benz
I just had to cut off some twins (Slatt)
They pretty, but constantly sin (Yeah)
He talkin' too much on the net
But I don't want him dead
Put a hole through his shin (Boom)
My bro let me sleep in his den
Kicked me out, said I couldn’t depend
On him as much as I shoulda been
But aye to who, imma be faithful to?
I'ma pimp 'til I turn eighty-two
It’s some things that I can’t say to you
Major move, I been puttin’ in double
Got Azu out lookin’ for troublе (Yeah)
Not Aronda, I live in the bubblе
Can't come home, take that bitch to the W (Frrd)
Baby girl, honestly I’m gettin’ over you
Got the nerve to talk while Yachty hoein’ you (Uh)
Baby girl everything I was showing you
That shit priceless, one touch it's the Midas
Hepatitis, I let her be ridin’
She drink liquor like she come from Ireland
Bitch I'm black, I get nervous from sirens
My bitch steady talkin' 'bout dietin'
But I promise she already thin
Guess it's women, I don't wanna ask
Please don’t bring up the things from my past
I shutdown, I lose interest fast (Slatt)
Ain’t too much I won’t do for the cash (Cash)
Yeah the mullah, Lil Boat be the ruler (Who)
No, I never listen to my tutor
I rather listen to my shoota (Frrd)
My bitch in New York, just opened a juice bar, she in love with Buddha’s
And the lil' bitch a lil' older
Damn, I’m in love with the cougars (Go)
Paint the whip red like a rash (Yes)
So many 0s on the dash (Yes)
Triple M’s in the seat (Yes)
Money seats go to cash (Yes)
More love to your innocence
Ignorance won't last (Yes)
More power, more venomous
Weak hearted won’t last

[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

[Outro]
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu

[Verse 1]
I've been duckin' my friends, I've been stuck on my ends
Memories about people all in my head
First come to mind is my mama buyin' me Jordans
Are we really made equal? 'Cause everybody got plans
I can't go ghost, I face demons
Don't let it defeat you, all in my hands
I know it's hard for you to come out that trance
I look myself in the mirror when I can
Let's speak the truth, tell me in pieces
I know it's you, I know just what you do
I knew since we first got evicted out our roof
My new since rehab, I was six, tryna see you

[Chorus]
How could I resent you? Demons, they test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we been through
Don't let the wolves come get you, ooh-ooh
Please don't let them come get you, ooh-ooh
How could I resent you? Demons, they test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we been through
Don't let the wolves come get you, ooh-ooh
Please don't let them come get you, ooh-ooh

[Interlude]
Beep
What it beep-bop
What it beep-bop (Bop)
What it beep-bop (It)
What it beep-bop (It)
What it, bop
What it, bop
What it, bop
What it, bop
What it, bop
What it, bop
What it, beep-bop
What it, beep-bop
What it, beep-bop

[Bridge]
Run away from home, run away from home
When the night's gone, when the night's gone
Run away from home, run away from home-home-home-home-home
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why all seem to be convinced?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all question my exit?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all livin' on the fence?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why I'm sleepin' on it?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all get me so upset?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all want me dead?
Why y'all listen to the demons in your head?
Why do we play victim? Good times are ahead

[Verse 2]
Attention, this is my life sentence, huh, huh
You're committed, huh, defensive 'bout your vision, huh, huh
Don't you get offended, huh
When the darkness hits, I'll show you all that I'm not kiddin', huh
Grow a tree, plant the seed, let it breathe
My sister Ree-Ree only see me on the screen
I know she needs me, I can't help but feel T

[Chorus]
How could I resent you? Demons, they test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we been through
Don't let the wolves come get you, ooh-ooh
Please don't let them come get you, ooh-ooh
How could I resent you? Demons, they test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we been through
Don't let the wolves come get you, ooh-ooh
Please don't let them come get you, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

I'm Drawing to the ragged hole
I'm frightened by the total goal
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the vipеr's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in thе quicksand of my thoughts
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!

[Verse 3]
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
Tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thoughts
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!

[Crowd cheering]

Thank you! Good evening, welcome to Phoenix!

[Intro: Gail Ann Dorsey]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Gail Ann Dorsey]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba bе
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
Peoplе on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3: Gail Ann Dorsey]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro: David Bowie]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Intro: Cx - vocals echoing]
Yo KRS it's time to make a statement up in here
Let everybody know what's really goin on in America
Behind closed doors of this Bush Administration
There's a war goin on
Which side you on?
Which side you represent, huh?
Yeah!

[KRS-One]
YEAH~! To all the families
That got somebody overseas
In that bullshit war
That's what we tellin

Yeah what'chu know about real war when it's happening?
Who you care for, who your heart, think about your friend
Fightin with Iraq and them, rebel forces trackin him
Bombs in the front, underneath, and in back of thеm
While we chillin in that Escalade, thеy dodgin rocket propelled grenades
So what you ace of spades
What about the promises that were made?
No one in America feels any safer, in fact we feel betrayed
Over 200 families played
With an American flag and a letter that says your child got sprayed
In the sands of Iraq, forget the economy
Mr. President, when my kid comin back?
When my spouse comin back? Four million people out of work
Sayin right now when my house comin back?
Now we can see that to be all you can be
Man invadin Iraq and dodgin RPG's!

[Chorus 2X: Cx]
Rest in peace to them soldiers on a two-year tour
Frontline of the political war
Troops flyin out to Iraq, sent home in a black bag
Global terrorism droppin bombs over Baghdad

[KRS-One]
What's the cause, what's the point, what's the agenda?
WMD's, Iraqi freedom, I don't remember
Politics is one thing, lives are another
People seperated from they wives and they mothers
Fathers and brothers, leavin their families and others
Safe under the cover they're position first gunner
Hard times, demand even harder rhymes
You can't be stallin pimpin and ballin all the time!!
I speak about MORE than crime
I rhyme to the spirit, to them people with "Spiritual Minds"
But I hope you get the lyric in time
You just went to get a degree, now you behind enemy lines
But yo, everything is gonna be fine
You'll be home in no time and you'll remember this rhyme
Most of them soldiers in Iraq my friends
I ain't checkin for the war, but I'm checkin for them

[Chorus 2X: Cx]
Rest in peace to them soldiers on a two-year tour
Frontline of the political war
Troops flyin out to Iraq, sent home in a black bag
Global terrorism droppin bombs over Baghdad

[KRS-One]
You ain't gotta feel, when you pop that steel
Return fire comin in and things gettin real
From Desert Shield, to Operation Iron Grip
Americans will not forget that {ish}
While I spit another hit, over them news clips, every day
Yo Bush, how you become President anyway?!
Buyin off judges, exposin Clinton's lovers
Riggin elections, underminin all these others
It's time to uncover, the real plot
We need to build our own nation, and call it hip-hop
Yeah! Release the fear
The real hip-hop is over HERE!

("Speak the truth to 'em" *3X*)

[Intro: KRS-One]
Civil rights, abolitionist movement
Civil rights movement... anti-war

[Chorus 2X: Keith Stewart]
Comin straight off the block, we dem teachas
Always makin that dough, on the hustle
This is the scholar anthem, throw yo' hands up
If you a soldier, throw yo’ hands up

[KRS-One]
I'll never stop talkin 'bout Malcolm X
And I’ll never stop talkin 'bout havin safe sex
I'll never stop shoutin out Marcus Garvey or
Kwame Toure or Robert Marley
I'll never ease up on red, black and green
Or teachin what Martin Luther King's dream mean
Self-esteem, self-creation
Make yourself man, you in a wealthy nation!
Forgеt inflation, you are your own mason
Build yourself, set your foundation
Knowlеdge Reigns Supreme
That's why when you hear KRS, you know what it means
Stand up~!

[Chorus 2X: Keith Stewart]
Comin straight off the block, we dem teachas
Always makin that dough, on the hustle
This is the scholar anthem, throw yo' hands up
If you a soldier, throw yo' hands up

[KRS-One]
Check it; I’ll never stop showin the love man
I’ll never stop hangin up pictures of Harriet Tubman
I'll always be a learner, like Nat Turner
Spittin out words to take your mind further
Any time you see my face
You seein peace love unity all in this place
When enrollment’s down, crime is up
And if you can't hold your ground your time is up
But if you don't know your ground you holdin WHAT?!
Assumptions, when the storm hits you (hits you...)
Straight out of luck, feelin like you crashed your truck
That's when the teacher shows up
Stand up!

[Chorus 2X: Keith Stewart]
Comin straight off the block, we dem teachas
Always makin that dough, on the hustle
This is the scholar anthem, throw yo’ hands up
If you a soldier, throw yo' hands up

[KRS-One]
C'mon! Where my scholars at? Y'all can holla back
Knowledge and overstanding, we on top of that
We show you right where the commas and them dollars at
We hangin out where them educated mommas at
Follow that, where my educated poppas at?
We in the street too, movin when it's time to act
We dem teachas, tell me where your mind is at
Fear, doubt, no we do not follow that!
There, courage man, we need to bottle that
Cause all these kids nowadays hear a lot of crap
And they feelin like they gotta follow that
That's why the teacher is bringin the scholar back

[Chorus 2X: Keith Stewart]
Comin straight off the block, we dem teachas
Always makin that dough, on the hustle
This is the scholar anthem, throw yo' hands up
If you a soldier, throw yo' hands up

[Nas]
Aiyyo man, this is the end
And let me tell you somethin man
My man KRS, when I heard Spit-tacular was comin out
The greatest emcee of all time
I said I couldn't wait, I couldn't believe it
I couldn't wait to witness it
The greatest emcee of all time, KRS
And I'm from Queensbridge, you heard?

[KRS-One]
Let's go~!
I pray for my people that the light do reach you
Ignorance is lethal, this is why I teach you
Every boy and girl the wolf wanna eat you
But the wolf is part of thе same world that deceivеs you
Once you realize that there is no separation
You'll control the wolf from the center of your creation!
This that new rap language, or slanguage
Somethin to bang with man, we call it Edutainment man!
In 1994 DeSean Burke said it
Do you remember there we laid out the plan?
To overstand hip-hop you gotta overstand hip-hoppers
Afrika Bambaataa, they made this man!
And yeah there were others, undocumented sisters and brothers
That fell to crimes and drugs, it was crazy man!
But the secret to Edutainment
Is to take hip-hop beyond entertainment, leave baby land!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It seems we all forgot about that real hip-hop
KRS-One, bringin you that real hip-hop
That real music you've been waitin for to reach your spot
That main ingredient believable to keep this hot

[S-Five]
I manifest it from this hip-hop, adolescent
Now add the essence of S, now you got a weapon
Now pay attention if you listenin and you listen close
We're in position to lyrically hit you where it hurts the most
My proposition of philosophy spittin was written
The contradiction of the system's that I can not spit this
I can not budge to be a gimmick, I shoved you with lyrics
Then did it consecutive grippin, 'til I figured you'd gain
They like S come, huh? Meet KRS-One
Father of hip-hop, you're sorta like his step-son
The way, I get some, I done been it and had some
Rhymes, out of my mind so haters be vexin
I bless them, with a message like a scripture, paintin a picture
The fame insane, screamin my name
Picture the game changed, from that music that we all adventured
But all is not lost, hip-hop, I won't forget ya

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It seems we all forgot about that real hip-hop
KRS-One, bringin you that real hip-hop
That real music you've been waitin for to reach your spot
That main ingredient believable to keep this hot

[KRS-One]
KRS is after you crash the truck
And your jewels get plucked
And your so-called friends begin lyin again
What? When your life is thin
That's when I come in, KRS
Yeah! Big shout out to my man
M-I-C, Track Dons you did it again
Temple of Hiphop, stand up
Let's go to work

[Chorus]
It seems we all forgot about that real hip-hop
KRS-One, bringin you that real hip-hop
That real music you've been waitin for to reach your spot
That main ingredient believable to keep this hot
It seems we all forgot about that real hip-hop

[Intro: KRS-One]
YEAH, YEAH!! FEEL THAT~!
I'd like to thank everyone for comin out to the tour
Enjoyin us all throughout Europe
This is exclusive, we don't stop
This is real hip-hop, watch this now!

[KRS-One]
Straight from the under, the One is my number - watch this
All these newcomers are basically runners - watch this
Bitches and niggas and hoes for them others - watch this
I rhyme for mothers fathers sisters and brothers, my name Kris
The difference is realness, versus the fakeness, let's rock
I am an elder that helped to create this, hip-hop
Now that you know this regain your focus, be reminded
Straight from the +Criminal+ to +Spiritual Minded+ realignment
Movin in faster as you hearin the master, keep up
Don't worry 'bout battles, I'm 18 years past ya, speak up
The K to the R to the S to the One, ease up
I'm glowin like lava, hot as the sun, I don't freeze up
I take you backward rap and after that I'm takin the future
I hang with acrobats and breakin cats and whatever suits ya
Graffiti writers, beatboxin, just like we used ya
Deejays cuttin it up with a boomin speaker
Them days had fewer heaters, today we've got fewer teachers
Like America, hip-hop needs some newer leaders
KRS is the candidate
I understand I state, and overstand we great, rock!

[S-Five]
Yeah, it's BDP, 2006, Temple of HipHop
Yeah! We the culture, I swear
Listen, turn me up Alex

Constantly fightin Satan, watchin the moves I'm makin
Tryin to stay positive, look at the world we live
It's hard to get a job, that's why my brothers rob
In every hood same story but with different 40's
You either Blood or Crip, you sellin dubs or nicks
You gotta stand wit'cha man or you plug a chick
Now look what you get, quit tryin to play the part
You got caught up in the game now you in the dark
I'm seein people dyin, so many mothers cryin
That brother say he got your back, but that brother lyin
You need to grab a mirror, and look into it quicker
It ain't all about you man this thing is bigger
Cause everything that you do come back double fold
You ain't on the right track, take another road
Brother you gettin old, you've got to make a change
Cause this thing we call life brother it's not a game
Nah~!

Song:   What's Your Plan?

[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah
We live this
It gets kinda hard sometimes
Tryin to help those who dissin you at the same time
But this the life of the T'cha
And he's still gon' reach ya
This for the hood, rise up y'all

[KRS-One]
Why y'all keep shittin on me?
On the internet, cats think they spittin on me
But if you read they shit, they be real corny
For my downfall, they get real horny
All I'm tryin to do is educate the young ones
I got some guns, but we ain't no dum-dums, yo come son
Let me show you the way out
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, we never play out, or fade out
This a lifetime thing, you in darkness, heartless
Complainin about the light I bring?
Well stay there then, I guess you ain't my friend
But remember, hip-hop, it ain't gon' end
And there in the future, we gon' see
Who really was the slave, and who was free
Who sold out the culture, to be on TV
Nah, it won't be me

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Rappers wanna stop me pop me drop me lock me lock me top me
But they really up to no good - what's your plan?!
Critics wanna hit me get me clip me rip me strip me trip me
But they really up to no good - what's your plan?!
Players wanna slap me cap me crap me attack me, out rap me
But they really up to no good - what's your plan?!
Others wanna rush me dust me bust me lust me cuss me hush me
But they really up to no good - c'mon, man!

[KRS-One]
Now some of y'all buggin, cause I am hip-hop
But you are too, you just kyan't get dat
As a man thinketh, so is he
I am hip-hop, and so are we
And so is she, and so is he
I'm the only one teachin, and you wanna diss me
Why? Am I really that important?
Are you so desperate, any life you'll shorten?
Well nah kid - I'ma live on and on
You gonna respect me now, and not when I'm gone
I see how y'all did, JMJ
He paved your way but all you wanna get is your pay
I always be the knowledge giver
Preach you, uneasy, yo take your 30 pieces of silver
And hang yourself, by the end of this verse
But remember, the last shall be first

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Rappers wanna stop me pop me drop me lock me lock me top me
But they really up to no good - what's your plan?!
Critics wanna hit me get me clip me rip me strip me trip me
But they really up to no good - what's your plan?!
Players wanna slap me cap me crap me attack me, out rap me
But they really up to no good - what's your plan?!
Others wanna rush me dust me bust me lust me cuss me hush me
But they really up to no good - c'mon, man

[KRS-One]
Kris loves hip-hop, everybody knows that!
We came out of poverty and we ain't goin back
A 60 cent royalty, don't settle for that
Yo do what you gotta but don't remain in the trap
We all cryin out for leadership
But if the leader steps up and you diss him, what we gon' get?
YOU~?! You ain't even got a better plan
You can't even take hip-hop to a better land
You yourself ain't even a better man
Look who follows you - KRS even got better fans
Sure you get grands, and that's all good
But your video shows that you sold your manhood
So are you really eligible to challenge me?
Especially you writers that never made a CD?
Especially you deejays that get shit for free
You can't play Kane or P.E. - what's your plan?!

[Verse 1]
I think we're thinking too hard
So put on your shoes and get in your car
Put it in drive and point it this way
We don't have to talk, you don't have to stay

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Verse 2]
We've tried being apart
But the truth is we are who we are
We're so much alike, it ain't a good thing
Too dumb to give up, too stubborn to change

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Bridge]
'Til something better comes along
'Til whatever we have is gone

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Dude
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse]
Life's wicked for the mighty ranger nigga (I like)
When the girls are looking, please don't ask for pictures (It's up)
Mission everyday, just living on some scriptures (We here)
We forever (Know that), I won't miss you (Uh, uh)
Turn it loud, it don't matter when and how (It's cool)
I feel I graduated, time I take a bow (Salute)
Newer bitches, we escaping with the crew (As we do)
Get all in it (Aha), no more slackin' (He a beast)

[Intro]
Ohhhh, baby, ohhh

[Chorus]
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

[Verse 1]
From the first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you
I was rappin' 'till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?

[Chorus]
That's why
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

[Verse 2]
When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride--
Well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, can compare
To your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
I'm just tryin' to say

[Chorus]
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
You own my heart, you own my mind
I truly adore you
I truly adore you, darlin'
Adore you
You don't know what you mean to me, baby
Baby, baby
Until the end of time
I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
Adore you

[Breakdown]
Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
Run run, with her
Run run, with her
Run run, with her
Run run, with her
Run run, with her
Run run, with her
Run run, with her

Run run, with her top down, baby, she flies
Run run, with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run run, ha-cha cha cha, bcby, she goes

Out on this lonely run, on the road to love!
We can be strong, we can be strong!
Follow that unicorn on the road to love!
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on thе road, I'm on the road to love
Get your hot rods rеady to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna fall in love tonight !
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause' we're gonna drink until we die !

[Intro]
See, I'm not a freestyler but I'ma try a lil' something 'cause champagne got me feeling right
Champagne got me feeling right
You know what I'm saying?
Check it out, check it out, check it out

[Verse]
There's all kinds of MCs, short ones, black ones
Dope ones, wack ones
But only one fat, black one that's platinum
Check it out, as I flow on and on and on until the break of days, straight off the dome
Who roam the streets? Who rule the beats?
Big Poppa, show stopper, who smacked ya?
Smacked you up against the wall
Put the gun to your head - bow, bow, bow! Now ya fall

[Intro]
Ooh
Too long

[Verse 1]
A taste of chilled anisette, babe
Looking good in pink lunette, babe
I see her in pink lunette
I see her in pink lunette
I see her through pink lunette, baby
Woo
It was like
It was like, ah

[Verse 2]
A taste of chilled anisette
Looking good in pink lunette
Flashing billboards, sick regret, babe
Flaming stupor superjet
I see her in pink lunette, babe
Yeah
Well, Manfred climbed into my nape
Wrapped up in magnetic tape
All my lifе, magnetic tape
Falling
Man

[Verse 3]
And it chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop
Chopped up likе Richter's Atlas
I'm fading away
My position in space
Away
A Chekhovian smile
A Chekhovian smile
A Chekhovian smile of last orchards
A Chekhovian smile of last orchards
Softened mother's face
Ooh

[Verse 4]
Softened mother's face
Softened mother's face
Softened mother's face as she looked up from the Star
Coney Island, Richter's Atlas
Never, never, never, never know who you are
A taste of chilled anisette, babe
Looking good in pink lunette, maybe
Billboards flashing, sick regret
A flaming superjet
Looking good in pink lunettes
Ooh

[Verse 5]
A Chekhovian smile
A Chekhovian smile
A Chekhovian smile of last orchards, yeah
Softened mother's face
Softened mother's face
Softened mother's face as she looked up from the Star
My position in space
Fading, fading, fading
Fading, fading, fading
A taste of chilled anisette, baby
Looking good in pink lunette, maybe
Billboards flashing, sick regret, baby
A flaming superjet, wild pink lunettes
Manfred climbed into my nape, whoa
Wrapped up in magnetic tape
In my life, magnetic tape
Falling in magnetic tape
Maybe, maybe
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of those pink lunettes
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
Screaming and dreaming
Screaming
Those pink lunettes

[Verse 6]
Softened mother's face
Softened mother's face
Softened mother's face as she looked up from the Star
Coney Island, Richter's Atlas
Never, never, never, never know who you are
A taste of chilled anisette, baby
Looking good in pink lunette, maybe
Billboards flashing, sick regret
A flaming superjet
But I see her in pink lunettes

[Verse 7]
I should run and hide
Or die in the generational divide
It's getting wild
We'll fall in the generational divide
Was I born too late
For the golden days of my nanny state?
We never cried
On my side of the generational divide
Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a judgment for defendant city, entered in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), in their suits for a refund of taxes they paid pursuant to Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance §§ 21.168.1, 21.190.

Plaintiff taxpayers manufactured and delivered military weapons, equipment, and supplies for the federal government. Some of their shipments were made on government bills of lading; others were made on commercial bills of lading. Plaintiffs reported the gross receipts from their government contracts to defendant city, but excluded the receipts attributable to property shipped outside the state by bills of lading. Defendant assessed tax deficiencies, Riverside employment lawyers plaintiffs paid. Plaintiffs then brought complaints for refunds. The court reversed the trial court's order in favor of defendant. Plaintiffs were taxable on their gross receipts under Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance §§ 21.166, 21.167, not under Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance § 21.190, as defendant asserted; plaintiffs' processes of sale and service were commercially inseparable and could not be assessed separately. Plaintiffs were taxable on gross receipts for shipments on government bills of lading. These were not exempted by Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance § 21.168.1, as were those shipments made on commercial bills of lading.

The court reversed the judgment for defendant city, holding that plaintiff taxpayers could be taxed on their gross receipts from government contracts but that they were not taxable under the higher rate of a catch-all ordinance provision. The court also held plaintiffs liable for gross receipts attributable to shipments to points outside the state on government bills of lading, but not on commercial bills of lading.

Plaintiff brought an action charging defendant and others with violating the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), Civ. Code, § 3426, et seq., by misappropriating certain trade secrets belonging to plaintiff. The Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California, dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff petitioned for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order of dismissal and to permit the matter to proceed to trial.

Not long after filing suit, plaintiff went through bankruptcy proceedings, selling its rights in the alleged trade secrets, while reserving its rights of action for misappropriation commencing before the date of the transfer. Despite the efforts by defendant's counsel to conjure up a "current ownership rule," the court found no support for such a rule in the text of the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civ. Code, § 3426, et seq., cases applying it, or legislative history. Nor did the court find any evidence of such a rule in patent or copyright law, which defendants cited by analogy. Defendants offered no persuasive argument from policy for the court's adoption of such a rule. Although there might be situations where a suit by a former owner raised concerns about the rights of absent parties, or a risk of multiple or inconsistent liabilities on the part of parties before the court, the remedy for such concerns rested in California's liberal and highly flexible procedures for the permissive or compulsory joinder of parties. Because plaintiff's sale of the trade secrets was not an impediment to its maintenance of its action, the trial court erred by dismissing the complaint.

The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order dismissing plaintiff's claims, and to proceed with their adjudication in a manner consistent with the court's opinion.

Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I looked in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree"
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know, they got thirty seconds; Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy, it's Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Can't a nigga get some fucking chaos in hurr?
I'm the truth and the dare
And you can get your ass beat just like the kick and the snare
ScHoolboy's my niggy, you know I'm good in the 50s
That boy not that bad, eh, it's no Biggie
It's the G-O, and the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We blackout, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy man
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some Vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to a Dodger
Solve 'em (Oh no!) You can't bitch, I'm a problem
And you'll get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo
Brent Lowe, mind motherfuckin' been gone
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Don't get offended, love being darkskinned-ed
23 with a crib, and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis
Is that diamonds on your neck? Stay the fuck out my business
See, that's that Cherry Bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron
Motors Flog Gnaw, Vans on, fuck your Jordans
Went from throwing up to throwing carnivals (Yeah nigga!)
Boy, I'm a sicko, Flaco nigga, but kinda macho
Boy, I got some vatos and shout out to ScHooly, he kinda loco
Pack a de la pistol, we splitting nachos, then for that cheese
Boy, he was using some shells just like a taco, so grab your goggles
Nigga, Taco Tuesday, you don't want none of that
Have you heard of Fairfax? Boy, we was running that
Nigga took the store from us, yeah, fuck all of that
(Man, he really took the store)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
Crack a cracker with a barrel, uh (yeah)
Gang bang tattoos, this ain't a Louis rag (rag)
Orange Paisley got me crip crazy (uh, sup cuz?)
Pants heavy, sag to the left with the belt strapped
No face mask, nigga, just toe tags
Still, the blunts getting passed, yeah
Ain't worried 'bout no niggas (nigga)
I don't grieve over suckers (sucker)
Gunpowder on my knuckles (knuckle)
Call the ambulances (ambulances)
I'm from the era of crip walking
You was clown-dancing, you wanna be me, huh?
Cuz is wack in his raps and what he rap, he ain't done
It's Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussyboy, you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel, you want to smoke that kill
Well, who am I?

[Intro]
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker
Anything that'll piss you muthafuckas off
I don't even smoke and I'm a level above of y'all
Bitch, you couldn't reach me with a ladder and a calling card

[Hook]
I'm special, nigga
Who the fuck are you?!
I'm special, nigga

[Verse]
They used to tell me to calm down, said I have a problem
Now I'm runnin' shit, that's why you never see me wearin' joggers
Lead by example, how?
All y'all is my son and I ain't never had a fuckin' father
Boy, I'ma bring the noise
I got my own beat and we all got drums
What these weapons about? We're just flexin' about
You on your grind but who the one that got the wep at their house?
Bitch, I do this on purpose, you niggas don't got a purpose
This nigga call me a clown, nigga I own the circus
Stack is sittin' in my pocket folded like a papaya
You know I golf bitch like I been sleepin' with Tiger
Woody woody, my mob, mob is goodie we Oddkast
We O-K-K-K just like the clan hoodie
Golf shit packet, rip it out the fuckin' package
In that all pink fit lookin' like a fuckin' faggot
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, nigga!?
I'm a bad case of I don't even know
I gotta to tear the shit out of this goddamn house
I think that I'mma blow my muthafuckin' brains out
Tyler, take a chill pill, nigga

[Lyrics revealed]
I usually kind of hide it
But you make me want to open up...

[From the snippet]
I'll let you see my peach fuzz
I'll let you see what no one else does
You got me spinning like a (?)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well
Got me analyzing everything that ain't worth thinking 'bout
Just 'cause I ain't lived through
The same hand that was dealt to you
Doesn't make me any less or make any more of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't trade my best day
So you could validate
All your fears
And if I've only got one shot
Won't waste it on a shadow box
I'll stand right here

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

[Verse 2]
First mile is always harder
Whеn you're leaving what you know
Won't blame mе if you stay here waving to me as I go
I always wish the best for you
Hoped that you would see me through
My wildest dreams
Yeah, the ones you thought I'd never make

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, you would trade your best day
Just to have your way
All these years
But if you only had one shot
Maybe all this talk
Would disappear

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

[Post-Chorus]
It's a whole lot harder to shine
It's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

[Ending]
Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well

[Verse 1]
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

[Verse 2]
I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

[Chorus]
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

[Chorus]
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go?
So why don't we go?
Ooh, aah

[Outro]
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know

[Verse 1]
We pile into the backseat
Fixin' our makeup and hair
When we get out of the taxi
There’s glitter everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't pay cover 'cause we’re looking so pretty
Slide up to the bar like "Sex and the City"

[Chorus]
Tonight
We'll break your heart in a blink
Boys line up to buy us a drink
But all they're gonna get is a wink
Clink, clink
Lipstick on the sink
Sometimes you gotta paint
Paint the town pink

[Verse 2]
Cotton Candy Martini
Yeah, we're ready to dancе
Wish my ex-boyfriend could see me
I wouldn't givе him a second glance

[Pre-Chorus]
Room keeps spinnin' like a cyclone
Takin' lots of pictures all on my phone

[Chorus]
Tonight
We'll break your heart in a blink
Boys line up to buy us a drink
But all they’re gonna get is a wink
Clink, clink
Don’t care what they think
Sometimes you gotta paint
Paint the town pink
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't pay cover ’cause we're looking so pretty
Slide up to the bar like "Sex and the City"

[Chorus]
Tonight
We'll break your heart in a blink
Boys line up to buy us a drink
But all they're gonna get is a wink
Yeah, tonight
We’ll break your heart in a blink
Boys line up to buy us a drink
But all they're gonna get is a wink
Clink, clink
Lipstick on the sink
Sometimes you gotta paint
Paint the town pink

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you wanna get low-down and gritty?
Do you wanna go back out again?

[Verse 1]
We stop at 7-Eleven in his White Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

[Verse 2]
I can see the sparkle in your eyes
I can see it now, as I get closer
Knew that I heard it's no surprise
You're more crazy than a roller coaster
You're more crazy than a rollеr coaster

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, Nеw York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you wanna get low-down and gritty?
Do you wanna go back out again?

[Outro]
And I am all I wanna be
I try and I believe

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends can watch me
(Today)
(Today)

[Refrain]
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited
There's a party in my head
(My head, my head, my head, my head)
(My head, my head, my head, my head)
(My head, my head, my head, my head)
(My head, my head, my head, my head)

[Chorus]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Break]

[Refrain]
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited

[Outro]
Company's okay
Solitude is bliss

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about it and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please

[Verse 2]
Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss

[Pre-Chorus]
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to, but

[Chorus]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited

[Chorus]
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Outro]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Verse 1]
Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back
Was I the one who drifted off?
Did I take advantage of good love?
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love without the trust?
Does anybody wanna...

[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

[Verse 2]
Something steady, something good
It's probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid, it's getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know, it's hard to rеad
So I'll just keep moving, hoping someone out therе's gonna

[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

[Bridge]
S.O.S., it's out of hand
Just holding out for a love again
I'm sending signals, find me fast
I know, I know there's gotta be somebody who can

[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map
'Cause I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

[Outro]
On the map
On the map

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You look so different to me
It's like you barely even, listen

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
You look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' from me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like, Field Mob song, Trill Mob boy
Keep it MIA for too long, so far
Now catch the compensation
Change the conversation, dollars all I'm chasin'
Ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
I'm non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

[Verse 2: bearface]
You tryna cop all these diamonds and pearls
Count on mе, baby, I'll get you the world
You tryna-

Wait 'till this party starts to die

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Refrain]
Something 'bout you on my mind
I've got a man but, damn, you fine
When we leave this club tonight
I'm gonna have you on my mind
It's not much like we're in love
Not tryna hide but tried to run
Shouldn't have to tell you twice
We on until this party dies

[Chorus]
Keep your hands off me (Off me)
Cannot control what’s on my mind
Thoughts’ll get naughty, yeah
Swingin' my body side to side
Look what you’re doing to me
It's just too hard to start a fight
Keep your hands off me (Off mе)
Wait 'till this party starts to die

[Verse 2]
Yeah, let me tell you this first
Boy, you're making me purr
You tryna make it want more
But baby, this hurts, when you're touching my curves
Tell me all the right words, I think I might burst
Gettin' all on my nerves, feelin' on my skirt
And then I might burst, wanna tell the whole world
If that even the way that it works, baby

[Refrain]
Something 'bout you on my mind
I've got a man but, damn, you fine
When we leave this club tonight
I'm gonna have you on my mind
It's not much like we're in love

[Verse]
I've been patient
About this situation
And don't you worry
About your heart breakin'

[Chorus]
Said, I'll never leave you alone
But this part you do on your own, your own
I said, I'll never leave you alone
But this part you do on your own, your own
Yeah, I'll never leave you alone
But this part you do on your own, by yourself, baby
I said, I'll never leave you alone
But this part you do on your own, your own

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh
Ohh-ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Ohh-ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh
Ohh-ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
She walks around the block with a silver plated cutter
On her shoulder
To chase the dogs off when they come
She'd rather fight than run
So just be aware

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Everybody thinks she's crazy
I think maybe she just needs a patient ear
To listen to her stories
Let her know somebody cares
And there's a person there

[Pre-Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
I gave her a pair of shoes for Christmas
She looked up and smiled and said, "Somebody must've listened"

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves with Travis Meadows]
I got shoes on
My feet are off the ground
Thank you Jesus
This old world won't get me down
As long as I got prayers to pray and bills to pay
I'm still breathin' air
And there's a person there

[Verse 3: Kacey Musgraves]
Last one she told me
She was all down on her luck
When the landlord wanted her to kill her ex
For a little money and a truck
Mmm, but I ain't scared

[Verse 4: Kacey Musgraves with Travis Meadows]
Layin' in my bed
I hear the water run, the ceiling creak
I don't think she ever sleeps
But I love to hear those feet upstairs
'Cause there's a person there

[Pre-Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
Who knows? Maybe I'm a little crazy too
But crazy people always seem
To pull each other through

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves with Travis Meadows]
I got shoes on
My feet are off the ground
Thank you Jesus
This old world won't get me down
As long as I got prayers to pray and bills to pay
I'm still breathin' air
And I know there's a person there

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves & Travis Meadows]
I got shoes on
My feet are off the ground
Thank you Jesus
This old world won't get me down
As long as I've got prayers to pray and bills to pay
And I'm still breathin' air
And there's a person there

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves]
Her name's Sophia
But she makes me call her mama
And I don't mind
My family's far away
It's nice sometimes
When life ain't fair
To know there's a person there

[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, I just know I couldn’t stop

[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken hеart

[Verse 3]
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Likе a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

[Verse 4]
Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
(Hey, hey)

[Bridge]
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

(ProHoeZak Music)

[Chorus: ProHoeZak & Snoop Dogg]
Every time I twist one up, you always seem to come right on by (Come right on by, yeah)
You ain't never got no money, but you always wanna get a free high (Get a free high, yeah)
So don't be fuckin' (Don't be fuckin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray
Don't be touchin' (Don't be touchin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), not my roaches in my ashtray
I be lovin' (I be lovin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), all my roaches in my ashtray
So don't be fuckin' (Don't be fuckin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Nigga slid up in my car in the passenger seat
Talking my ears off, adjusting my beat
Stashed my heat up under my sеat
Stepped out my ride, hollеred at a few freaks
Take a couple flicks, mack a bitch
Baby, what's your name? (Passionate)
Fashion Nova, fashion fit
Dogg, where the weed at? Ain't that a bitch
I'm gibbing right now, it's Thanksgiving right now
Showing baby how I'm livin' right now
Clear the crowd, back to my car, no squares in my circle
Bodyguard hard, could've swore I left a blunt in my ashtray
Little homie slid up on me, pulled a fast play, but this the last play
Don't be fuckin' with my roaches in my ashtray
Hate to see ya comin', love it when you walk away

[Chorus: ProHoeZak & Snoop Dogg]
Every time I twist one up, you always seem to come right on by (Come right on by, yeah)
You ain't never got no money, but you always wanna get a free high (Get a free high, yeah)
So don't be fuckin' (Don't be fuckin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray
Don't be touchin' (Don't be touchin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), not my roaches in my ashtray
I be lovin' (I be lovin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), all my roaches in my ashtray
So don't be fuckin' (Don't be fuckin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Seat on recliner, suede headliner
Just pulled in Mel's Diner, line of
Chevys, 'Lacs, name it, it's there
Fresh wet paint, leather interior
Players are everywhere
Nothing but love and good bud in the air (Yeah)
Guap took his camera out
Taking pictures of the homies in they cars
While they hittin' switches, some knocking bitches
Me, I'm on a mission
Fuel injected, front end suspension
Wishing the whole world roll like we ride
There's always one homie tryna get that free high
Shit never fails, yeah, this shit for sale
Skip the bail, put the shit on a scale
This the last day for your last play
Quit fucking with the roaches in my ashtray

[Chorus: ProHoeZak & Snoop Dogg]
Every time I twist one up, you always seem to come right on by (Come right on by, yeah)
You ain't never got no money, but you always wanna get a free high (Get a free high, yeah)
So don't be fuckin' (Don't be fuckin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray
Don't be touchin' (Don't be touchin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), not my roaches in my ashtray
I be lovin' (I be lovin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), all my roaches in my ashtray
So don't be fuckin' (Don't be fuckin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Say, man, you niggas think y'all crafty, huh?
Sitting in my car, adjusting my music
Telling me how sweet my car is and all of the sudden my roaches is missin'
Say, man, don't be fuckin' with the roaches in my ashtray
You hear me?

[Verse 1: Jake]
I've been on my last kick for a minute
Running out of goals, stepping over toes
Sitting on the bench, I've been in it
Losing like a chore, coming up alone, yeah
Everybody thinks they're semi-pro
Then it all comes down like a waterfall raining on you
Got clean, I guess I'd rather never know
It's played out, now I'm hanging from the rafters

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Sweating hard, all alone
To take a lap, the sweetest one

[Chorus: Jake]
Head start on quitting
Save your breath, undressed and I'm never come back for oncе
Saw that name on my jersey
Always playеd for both teams
Had big dreams, then I felt bad
Killing you was a pleasure, man
Hope you understand that the measure wasn't all so tough
Kicking rocks in the promised land
Peace out and I'm never coming back now

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
It feels like it should
I'll just let you do the talking
If you wanna stay back, you should
I can't promise you I'm anything
But it feels so damn good
You just love the way I want ya
But I'm cool with it, so knock on wood
I've been bad, but I'm only getting better
I've been bad, but I'm only getting better

[Bridge: Jake]
Not a second thought to lose, yeah, yeah
Gained something that I never thought I'd have before
Been broken and bruised, yeah, yeah
Peace out, I'm never going back now

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
It feels like it should
I'll just let you do the talking
If you wanna stay back, you should
I can't promise you I'm anything
But it feels so damn good
You just love the way I want ya
But I'm cool with it, so knock on wood
I've been bad, but I'm only getting better
I've been bad, but I'm only getting better

[Outro: Jake]
It feels so damn good (It's bad but I'm only getting better)
I've been bad but I'm only getting better
It feels so damn good (It's bad but I'm only getting better)
I've been bad but I'm only getting better
It feels so damn good (It's bad but I'm only getting better)
I've been bad but I'm only getting better
I've been bad but I'm only getting better
I've been bad but I'm only getting better

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What's it take to call your brother
Just to say you miss him and you wish you could spend time
What's so serious that you can't just pick up the phone
Let him know you love him
And that he's been on your mind
Tell him that you need your brother
Ask him how he's doing
And say you've been doing fine
If it comes a point where you just don't know what to say
While you still have him on the line
Just say

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
We'll be, brothers forever
What happens to one of us, happens to us together
And we'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever
Wе'll be, brothers forevеr
We'll be, brothers forever

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Couldn't kill me if you tried, couldn't kill me if I died
I'm gon' always be alive, you were always in denial
Heard your song, you stole my vibe, so I brought back my old vibe
Funny every time you lied, how that turned into more lies
I'm too nice to all my dawgs, stand by me when I go wrong
Please don't love me for this stuff like you never did nothing wrong
Why did you do something to me?
Man, I'm still mad at my dad, uh
I fucked that bitch, she was bad, I fucked that bitch, on the rag
Years ago (Mmm)
Might get physical
Might get something, might digital
Life do something like digital, all romance got digital
How low something? Life critical
And this conversation critical and I'm something so pitiful
Why you standing, looking so pitiful?
Don't you know that you are beautiful?
Everything 'bout you beautiful
Everything about you is beautiful
That was the without you, new to them
We can do it now, what you knew of them?
Maybe the- maybe the world will be without me
Maybe we sleep with- sleep without me
Maybe life signs off, days was cloudy
Maybe God, dun-dun, signing off 

[?]
Still ashamed
August Ames, all the same
All the pain, 

[?] and all the lames live the thing
Everything, everything
(Alien, takeoff, monster)

[Verse 3: Ant Clemons]
I'm my brother's keeper
I'm a promise keeper
I won't let you slip, let you slip
Let no one ever tell my brother to keep up, wait
You calling, I'll show up, hit
My phone and I'll answer
I won't let you slip, let you slip
Long as I'm alive, I'm my brother's keeper
I'm my brother's keeper
Made a promise to my mama
With my right hand on the Bible
I won't lie right to your honor
Blood don't make us any closer
We'll get on before it's over
'Member freestylin' on them sofas
Now we sin in California, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
We'll be, brothers forever
What happens to one of us, happens to us together
And we'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Brothers forever
Brothers forever
While you still have him on the line

[Verse 1]
Two weeks all she's had for for lunch
Is diet pills and Captain Crunch
Eyes lined like Tammy Faye Baker
Cut her hair off with a razor
She's wearin' her wedding dress
And God only knows what comes next

[Chorus]
Call the Sheriff, call the shrink
She's on quicksand, 'bout to sink
You got around and it got around
Yeah, you were on the verge of a nervous breakdown

[Verse 2]
Yards of rope up in the attic
Grandpas loaded automatic
Liquid Draino Clorox bleach
And kitchen knives all within reach
She swears she won't hurt herself
But she might hurt somebody elsе

[Chorus]
Call the Sheriff, call the shrink
Shе's on quicksand, 'bout to sink
You got around and it got around
Yeah, you were on the verge of a nervous breakdown

[Bridge]
Did your laundry, cooked your dinner
Never saw the crazy in her
We're all one heart break away
From temporarily insane

[Chorus]
Call the Sheriff, call the shrink
She's on quicksand 'bout to sink
You got around and it got around
The crazy train has come to town
You better head for higher ground
The women's on the verge of a nervous breakdown

[Intro]
Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff

[Chorus]
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy

[Verse]
Park him on the spot, park him if he say he hot
Park him while his friends watch
I am everything you not
They say shame on me, I got the underground on lock
That's what hoes say, that's what the bros say
I tell a freak bitch, "Baby, let's roleplay"
I like the kinks bitch, fuck mе 'til the OJs
I mean my chain a woo-sah, I mean my gamе a woo-sah
I want some head in my new car, bitch, I don't care who drive by
You know I could make you famous
You know life bring changes
Shit, I changed locations soon as that big bag came in
That's a mighty fine ass you got
Thought I forgot?
I can make the play and walk it out
Thought I forgot? Aye

[Chorus]
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job

Partyin' like it's your job

Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we makin' moves
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job, ayy

Partyin' like it's your job

[Verse 1]
Marble halls and chandeliers
Vestibules and souvenirs
Vanity like a treasure chest
Silverware for a hundred guests

[Pre-Chorus]
If you think it might leave you satisfied
If this is your idea of a perfect life
Take mine

[Verse 2]
Recognition and a paved driveway
Good manners and bad fruitcake
Socializing with the socialites
Wasting all my Saturday nights

[Pre-Chorus]
All the precious things money can't buy
If you wanna know what these privileges are like
Take mine

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' for highly understated, little downgraded
They don't make 'em like they used to
Rough around the edges, nothin' too impressive
Bona fide attributes
I'd rather hang around some sleepy little town
With a taste for the unrefined
So if you want the high life
Take mine

[Outro]
Groundskeeper and a maitre'd
Probably won't even ever miss me
Big parties and promenades
I never really liked to dance anyway
All these precious things don't satisfy
If you think happiness is what you're gonna find
Take mine

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We the Best Music
Another one
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Post Malone, DJ Khaled, Post Malone & DJ Khaled & Megan Thee Stallion]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Ayy), I did it, I did it, I did it

[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
Take it off then bend over, let me see it
If you're lookin' for a trill type bitch, let me be it
I'm from the South, never had a handout
'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth
These bitches so quick to switch up
I'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up
It ain't directed, so it ain't respected
Stop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch
I'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it
Why you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?
Countin' my money ain't makin' you rich
Talkin' down on me don't make you the shit
How my name in your mouth more than your spit?
I really encourage my haters to talk
Throwin' that shade only keepin' me lit, huh

[Chorus: Post Malone & DJ Khaled]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Hey, goddammit, I get it
They don't like to see when we win, but I did it
Hey, I stand by my city
Chopsticks sound like a guitar in the air
Stop and take a picture when I'm jumpin' off a Lear
I done ran it up, it only took a couple years
The money be callin', if it wasn't for my lil' partner
Then the bullshit they be talkin' 'bout, I wouldn't even hear
New sports car go, "Vroom," switch gears
Hey, how you? Goddamn, come here
Thought of goin' vegan, then again, I'm like, "For what?"
I got ten karats each in my left and right ears
'21 Tesla, I don't even gotta steer
My climax ain't even nowhere near it
I stayed down and I stayed down
And I came up, I had faith in my spirit

[Chorus: Post Malone, DJ Khaled, Post Malone & DJ Khaled & DaBaby]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Go), I did it, I did it, I did it

[Verse 3: DaBaby & DJ Khaled]
Diamonds on my neck
New contract, I ain't signin' that ho yet
Private plane flyin' somewhere, smilin' on the jet
I drop hit after hit, now that's the domino effect
These niggas out here goin' flat
Ain't no stoppin' it, pink and blue paper all day like Monopoly
Brand new Pradas, I'm proud of me
Actually came from the bottom
Ain't no need in even askin' me, ain't even seen the half of me
And ain't no passin', that's a no-go
Start them killer player niggas out here throwin' low blows
I done got good with the shit
I tell the paparazzi, "Get my angle," every time they take my photo (Another one)

[Chorus: Post Malone, DJ Khaled & Post Malone & DJ Khaled]
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

[Intro]
Last night, all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Intro]
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that’s coming your way baby
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I've got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby
Spike heels and skin tight jeans
I’ve got a fist full of love that's coming your way baby
When I'm making love to you
Oh yeah, you give me instant déjà vu
Oh yeah, don't be afraid to show it
Oh yeah, when I'm making love to you
Yeah, oh yeah
You give me instant déjà vu

Everytime I think of you
I'm blown out of my mind
Yeah, you give me instant déjà vu
Do it one more time

When it's real love
It's the best drug
This is real, don't be afraid to show it
Love the first time, love the second time
Baby, you give me instant déjà vu

Oh, yeah, when I'm making love to you
Yeah, oh, yeah
You give me instant déjà vu
Everytime I look at you
Your beauty makes me blind
You turn my crazy skies to blue
I'm getting back in line, yeah, because

When it's real love, it's the best drug
This is real, don't be afraid to show it
Love the first time, love the second time
Baby, you give me instant déjà vu

Yeah, ooh yeah, don't be afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it, show it
Instant déjà vu

[Verse 1: Jake]
I'm gonna get you a big balloon
A box of chocolates and some cheap perfume
Happy Valentine's Day to you
Hope it's better than mine
'Cause my dog's about to die, yeah
Got her back when I was 15
My parents split up so they gave her to me
My consolation prize, a real dream (Dream, dream)
But she always liked my momma better

[Chorus: Jake]
'Cause I don't even care what my best friends are doing
I'm in bed with the devil and I kinda need a drink
Let's take a shot of holy water, lay it all to waste
I'm a bad dream, baby and I'll never go away
I'm a bad dream, baby and I'll never go away (Oh!)

[Verse 2: Jake, with Nathan]
I'm worried about Britney Spears
It's pretty fucked up how her dad runs her life
I wish my dad was more involved in mine
But not like that, really not like that, yeah
My girlfriend's at Coco's house
She's basically the nicest person
Really wish I could be like that
But I'm not like that, really not like that

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
I don't even care what my best friends are doing
I'm in bed with the devil and I kinda need a drink
Let's take a shot of holy water, lay it all to waste
I'm a bad dream, baby and I'll never go away
I'm a bad dream, baby and I'll never go away

[Bridge: All]
I just smoked a whole pack of Parliaments
I wanna go back to partying
Even though I'm old
Remember hangin' out at Grumpy's?
Chillin' with some dudes in their forties
They always had my back
But never had their own

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Kinda wonder what they're doing now
If they had dogs and they had to put 'em down
Hope my girl's somewhere barkin' in the clouds
With her dead pet friends
Where their love don't end

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
I don't even care what my best friends are doing
I'm in bed with the devil and I kinda need a drink
Let's take a shot of holy water, lay it all to waste
I'm a bad dream, baby and I'll never go away
I'm a bad dream, baby and I'll never go away
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low-down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull her closе
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without bеing disrespectful (Damn, girl)

Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch (Damn, girl!)
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch (Damn, girl!)
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here in wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull her close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful (Damn, girl!)

Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch (Damn, girl!)
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch (Damn, girl!)
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch (Damn, girl!)
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, you's a sexy bitch
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I said I think it's time to kill it
Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly
Tell her make me a sandwich, no pb and jelly
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah whoa"
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me up 2 to 10, and 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on firе that's a meteor
So I'm eithеr or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR

Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gang bang major pain
D-Town I ride around, me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day to day base, then vacay for eight days, ooh
You know mutha fuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, oh no, you can't taste it
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get long

[Verse 1]
Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind

[Chorus]
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child?
You know how much I need it

[Verse 2]
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
And sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one

[Interlude]

[Verse 1]
So what's left of your imagination?
When time slows down, you lay still
Looking back, it's not always worthless
You're aware of the bed you lay in
Cling to youth, it's your own devotion
Though it's juvenile, you remain open
Oscillations that ricochet
Let the child in you slowly meditate (Oh)

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Up on the mountain
Searched through the valley
Can you hear me calling?
Won't you come find me?
Please don't forsake me
All of a sudden
My heart is breaking
I feel it coming

[Verse 1]
I've seen this place before (Searched through the valley)
A color-blinded senseless sight to see (Can you hear me calling?)
And when it rains only rains on me (Won't you come find me?)
But where were you when I was frozen? (Please don't forsakе me)
Drenched in whitе stone, it was cold (All of a sudden)
And I had been ashamed and opposed to fire (My heart is breaking)
But still I do everything you require (I feel it coming)

[Pre-Chorus]
So what can I say but I'm hoping (Searched through the valley)
The hour will still turn to golden (Can you hear me calling?)
And we will see the sun as it's supposed to be (Won't you come find me?)
Shining straight through to you and me

[Chorus]
Up on the mountain (Up on a mountain)
Searched through the valley (searched through the valley)
Can you hear me calling? (Can you hear me calling?)
Won't you come find me (Won't you come and find me?)
Please don't forsake me (Please don't forsake me)
All of a sudden (All of a sudden)
My heart is breaking (Mm-hmm)
I feel it coming (I, I)

[Verse 2]
I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be together
So tell me where you go when you know better
I love holding you and touching you
'Cause you help me deal with the pain
So how could you turn into
The demons you
Once said that you'd keep away

[Bridge]
I'm in my feelings, I'm tired, I'm bleeding
I'm nothing, I'm choking without you
I become weak from the mountains
I'll scream 'til the morning wraps me back around you
Where the colors of your mind will turn around
And so will you too
Oh, oh no, don't let it go

[Chorus]
Up on the mountain (Mountain, baby)
Searched through the valley (Searched through the valley)
Can you hear me calling? (Can you hear me calling?)
Won't you come find me? (I know, I know, I know)
Please don't forsake me (Please don't)
All of a sudden
My heart is breaking
I feel it coming
Up on the mountain
Searched through the valley
Can you hear me calling?
Won't you come find me
Please don't forsake me
All of a sudden
My heart is breaking
I feel it coming

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
We reject what we don't understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin'
Heart is hard, and can't nobody see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I can't stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous 'cause they wanna be me
Damn it man, this life ain't easy
It takes over me
My unforgiveness keeps control of mе
Damnit, I gotta get a hold of me
Gotta get a hold of mе, oh
What you want out of life? That's the question
This ain't a simulation, it's a blessing
Is it a mistake or is it destined?
We ain't got no time for second guessin'
We can't save ourselves, we need a savior
We ain't make ourselves, we need a maker
I keep failin' myself, I need somethin' new
So I lay my life down, I give it all to You

[Bridge: Chandler Moore]
All to You, give it all to You (I give it all to You)
Give it all to You, give it all (I give it all to You)
Oh, oh

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Chandler Moore]
I came to the end of me, believin' the enemy
Comin' with that "Mmm", man, you ain't a friend of me
Nothing can fix that, ooh, not even the Hennessy
I had to switch it up, yeah, switch up the remedy
God, can You use imperfect people? (Oh)
'Cause I'm broken through and through (Oh)
Just tell me where I need to go (Need to go)
'Cause that's all that I wanna do (All that I wanna do)
I'm a mess, but I'm tryna grow
I'm upset, but I still wanna know
Is there more for my life
Or is that all she wrote? (Is that all she wrote?)
Uh, is that all she wrote? (Is that all that she wrote?)
Is that all she wrote? (Is that all that she wrote?)
Is that all she wrote?

[Verse 3: Brandon Love]
Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a master's in forgiveness
I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
I'd rather pray to God, than pray for wishes
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm 'bout my Father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish
You can't undermine a mastermind
I may be out of your mind, but I ain't out of mine
I'm co-crucified, bury, resurrected
And perfected in the Son of God
Just like water turn to wine, I'm a prophetic sign
Ask your barber, I'ma headliner in New York Times
My life verses, I am His, yeah, and He is mine
The great "I Am's", the greatest Lamb of all time
Rebranded, redesigned and redefined
From Brandon to brand new
I'ma brand name in the household, brand too
Who are you to try to tell me what I can't do? We need a pull, huh?

[Outro]
You ever ask yourself "Am I gonna make it?"
Well, I don't know, of course I can fake it
But honestly, can I go wrong?
I'm so tired, I'm so broken, I'm so weary
Oh, God, oh, God

[Intro]
Yeah, it's not easy growin' up
You know, mm

[Verse 1]
Only two years old, I was playin' drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young, I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later, hehe
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah
That wasn't easy, 'cause at seventeen, I had a milli'
Women throwin' themselves at me had me goin' silly
On the surface, I felt like thе man
But deep inside I felt deprivеd just like an empty can

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had everything in life that people strive for (Strive for)
Just to ask the question: "What are we alive for?" (Alive for)
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, what would you die for? (Die for)
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?

[Chorus]
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together

[Verse 2]
I moved out when I was eighteen
I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin'
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin'
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash our sins away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question: "What are we alive for?"
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, what would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?

[Chorus]
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together

[Outro]
I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace. I pray for joy. I pray for confidence. I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters, bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, "Everything is going to be all right."
In the name of Jesus
In the name of Jesus

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Where You go, I follow (Where You go, I follow)
You're with me every step of the way
Here in the struggle (Here in the struggle)
Your love's enough to wash it all away

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
On the third day, yeah, You rose up
And You beat death once and for all (Once and for all)
Once and for all (Once and for all)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
There's nobody like You (Like You, like You)
There's nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
There'll nеver be nobody like You (Likе You, like You)
There'll never be nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)

[Verse 2: Pink Sweat$]
Sometimes this world is feeling crazy
At times my mind is feeling hazy
But, Lord, You always come and save me
God Almighty, my safety
You're my end, You're my new beginning
You're my home, the One I confide in
You're the very air I breathe
The reason that I sing

[Bridge: Chandler Moore]
Oh, I've tried it all
Nothing could fix the damage in my heart
'Til I met Your love
Oh, You gave Your life so I won't fall apart

[Pre-Chorus: Chandler Moore]
On the third day, yeah, You rose up
And You beat death once and for all (Once and for all)
Oh-oh, once and for all
Yeah-eh-eh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Chandler Moore]
There's nobody like You (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus; No-oh-oh)
There'll never be nobody like You (Oh-oh-oh)
There'll never be nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus) (Yeah, yeah, ayy-ayy, yeah)

[Outro: Judah Smith]
Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
Hasn't billions of men and women lived on this planet?
But why, why are we convinced there's nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
"Is there anyone like Jesus?
Who is this Jesus?"
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so, there is nobody like Jesus (Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus)

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Do we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, do we?)
Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, are we?)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
We can't write people off
God never writes us off
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing
God never writes us off, ever
He's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off (He never writes us off)

[Outro: Lauren Walters & Justin Bieber]
You formed the whole of me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Inward and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
I am awesomely and wonderfully created (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book
Psalms 139:13-16

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
When the day is over
And those thoughts set in
That's when I start to wonder
Where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that You're holding me tight
You say the past is behind me and it'll be alright
And You say to me, it'll be alright

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly & Justin Bieber]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
When I'm all alone and fear is all I see
Sitting in the silence with these insecurities
It's then You remind me, You're holding me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side
And You say to me, it'll be alright
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 3: Chandler Moore, Justin Bieber & Chandler Moore]
I know You're not a God out there hiding on mountains, oh no
You come right where I am, lost my way but You found me
Like a ray in the dark, on my ugliest days
You say that You'll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You're holding me tight
You said the past is behind me and it will be alright
Oh, and You say to me it'll be alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright
It will, it will be alright

[Sermon: Judah Smith]
I hear those words over and over, "It'll be alright"
Go to sleep, My child, it'll be alright
Sleep soundly, My child, it'll be alright
I'm right here, My child, it'll be alright
I won't go anywhere, it'll be alright
You're in the palm of My hand, it'll be alright
My arms are wrapped around you, it'll be alright
While you sleep, I watch over you, it'll be alright
I'll take care of your loved ones, it'll be alright
Your future's in My hands, it'll be alright
Your past is forgiven, it'll be alright
Your future is secure, it'll be alright
I forgive you, it'll be alright
I'm your friend that's closer than a brother, it'll be alright
Sleep now for when the morning comes
My mercies will be new, it'll be alright

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
This is my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
See, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Easy now

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Said the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimеs I ain't
See, the preacher man call mе a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
Well, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Outro]
Said my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I’m on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayеd for better weathеr

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What’s the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Get to the Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Oh, across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

Oh, across the Rio Grande-o

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's alright 'cause I love you
And that's not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You'd guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright 'cause I love you
And that's not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
'Cause it looks like rain
Here come the rain
Whole world's turning gray, and it looks like rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Here come the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here come the rain (Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
The people up — hello — the people up in the front are getting smashed horribly again. If everybody on the floor could sorta try to move back, it'd be helpful. Back. Move back. Move back. Move back. Move back. It's hard for us to get off seeing smashed human bodies up here, know what I mean? Give us a little mercy

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing around the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
No, no, no
Please don't murder me

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngin's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her plеading I denied
That leavеs only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Come on you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes 'round again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be onе less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you'rе doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey around
Want you to tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
There's one man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to lеave you sitting there
Composing lonеly blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play, children
And please play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
We're gonna take a short break, and you can, too

[Interlude]
This is a slow march for all you people who wanna take a step back and march in time

When I count to four, everybody take a step back
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Now give these folks a chance to rave

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And thеre follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don’t know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to mе
Let me lay 'neath thе roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don’t know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah she climbed up on Samson’s knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion’s head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
That's right

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

Come on up here if you feel it

[Verse 1]
Great North Central, would you all board
You can't find a ride like that no more
The night the chariot swung down low
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go
One long party from front to end
Tune to the whistle going 'round the bend
No great hurry, what do you say?
Might as well channel me every good way

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

[Verse 2]
Ragtime slowly for twеnty-five miles
Then switch ovеr to the cajun style
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues
Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose
Long train running from coast to coast
Bringing home a party when you need it the most
Work on the box car, beat on the bell
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

[Bridge]
Never had such a good time in my life before
I'd like to have it one time more
One good ride from start to end
I'd like to take that ride again
Again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Ran out of track and I caught the plane
Back in the county with the blues again
Great North Central is on my mind
I might like to ride it just one more time

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

Thank you. We're gonna take a short. We'll back in just a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any old day now
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way now
Time sure passing slow
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day now
Don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say now
Them voices tell me so
Been so long I felt this way now
Time surе passing slow
Still I know I lead the way now
'Cause I know whеre I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my word fills the sky with flame
And might and glory gonna be my name
And they gonna light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day now
Don't worry 'bout me, no
Been so long that felt this way now
But I'm in no hurry, no
This afternoon, streets turned gray now
And I watch the cars below
My time coming, any day now
Don't worry 'bout me, no

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, I know where I'll go

[Outro]
No, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
Ah, no, no, no (Ooh)
Ah, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stеphen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfingеr dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York has got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Now most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
And most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
I was sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
I got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street (and elsewhere)
Set up, like a bowling pin
And knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounds so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, 'cause I had to dance
Started moving my feet now, well, yes, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, oh no, 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, at twelve o'clock now, oh, the place was packed
The front doors was locked now, I said the place was packed
But whеn the police knocked now, thеm old doors they flew back

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, oh no, until the moon went down
The big ol' moon went down now

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, it sounds so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, 'cause I had to dance
Started moving my feet now, while clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Ow, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, oh no, 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around now
Woo, and reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound now
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now

[Outro]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Ooh, they never stopped rocking, no
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around now
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Reaching to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night, crazy night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, ah, Saturday night! Crazy, crazy night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Uh-huh, ow, Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on my TV, the Prеsident comes on the nеws
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, take out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey now, Saturday night! Alright
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night now
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Saturday night!

[Bridge]
Easy now

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Everybody get down (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)

One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotivе rolling down the track
He's gone, gonе
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, yeah, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, he's gone, oh oh)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Well, he's gone, well, he's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(You know)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Oh, nothing's gonna bring him back)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Well, he's gone, well, he's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
(Coming around) Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Fever rolled up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Bridge]
See herе how everything
Lead up to this day
But it's just likе any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun, it going down
Shine through my window
And my friends they come around
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people might know
But the people don't care
A man could be
As poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
You know he's lying in pain
Now let's go run and see
Oh, run and see
Oh, run, run and see
Run, run and see
Run, run and see
Run, run and see
Run, run and see
Run, run, run and see
Run, run, run and see
Run, run, run and see

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

[Chorus]
Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Now, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around now

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singing, I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window, going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singing, I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, hey, hey, yeah now
Sunshine daydream, hey hey
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, I think I wanna daydream
Sunshine daydream now, oh
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, well, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, I think I wanna daydream
Sunshine daydream
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through

Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Just a loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So exciting
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell mе a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's truе

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Liquid loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire around my heart (Lightning)
Come on, come on lazy lightning
Lazy lightning

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
They say you never start the same place
I want a double dose any my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
I thought that would do

Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
My lightning, my lightning, too

[Outro]
(My lightning, too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning, too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning, too)
My lightning, too
(My lightning, too)
Come on, come on lazy lightning
(My lightning, too)
My lightning, too
(My lightning, too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning, too)
My lightning, too
(My lightning, too)
Come on, come on lazy lightning
(My lightning, too)
My lightning, too
(My lightning, too)
My lightning, too

[Verse 1]
Woo, well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Help me, y'all
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, if this is real now
Got to tell me, girl, now
Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong with in head now
Got to help me, girl
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Bolt of lightning now
Cause me such excitation
Well, you got me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak

[Verse 1]
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
Well, I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Yeah
Uh
Check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out, check it out, y’all
Check it out, check it out, check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ayo

[Verse]
I'm a pretty nigga, gonna raw dog in dirty bitches
And if you get burnt, you givin’ that shit to 30 bitches
You say you know a nigga like me? Guess again, Pop
'Cause I might smile up in your face, but I ain't your friend, Pop
Jump out the 1500, like, "Run it"
Niggas don't want it, did it, done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrappin'
I made it bustin', bustin', I made it cappin’
And lettin’ off wasn't nothin’ new to a nigga
Somethin' to do to a nigga
'Cause you'se a fool, nigga
I know your type, you hype all up off that fakе shit
Can’t understand why your man would have to take shit
And stеal shit, and this is that real shit
Niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head, you won't feel shit
Rrr, let the dogs loose on a nigga's ass
Find out if the nigga's faster than a trigger blast
A fuckin' snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is makin' movies, but I gots to stop production
I need to block the function and maybe I'll stop destructin'
'Cause Glocks are not for frontin', just let me get that, shorty
'Cause you don't need that, shorty
You don't know what to do with that, shorty
You might as gon' hit this 40 just before you hit the floor
Another 24, what you want, money? More?

[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
One man gone and another to go
Why, oh, do do do

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
There's one man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Prettiest lady in the area-O

[Verse 3]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me? I will set your cities free
And free all the people in the area-O

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
Well, I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 5]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Outro]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby sharеd the secrets of my soul
Standing right bеside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lala, lala, lala

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Outro]
Hey now now

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounds so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, Lord, I had to dance
I started moving my feet, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Oh, no, they never stopped rocking, 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, at twelve o'clock, oh, the place was packed
The front doors was locked, I said the place was packed
But when the police knockеd, those old doors flew back

[Chorus]
Well, no, thеy never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, no, they never stopped rocking, 'til the moon went down
Down, down, down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, it sounds so sweet, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, Lord, I had to dance
I started moving my feet now, Lord, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

Thank you. We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in just a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first beliеved you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruеl sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
And round and round and round
Don't take much to get me on the ground
She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing
(Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 2]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned off all my lights

[Chorus 2]
Round and round
And round and round
And round and round and round
Don't take much to get me on the ground
Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don't want my love no more
So, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah, yеah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
"Thank you, for a rеal good time"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 3]
Round and round
And round and round
And round and round and round
Don't take much to get the word around
Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with the other guys
So, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 4]
Went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you 'til the day I die

[Chorus 3]
Round and round
And round and round
And round and round and round
Don't take much to get me on the ground
I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree when its fruit ain't ripe
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Sing it, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
And what remains? The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
Same old friends the wind and rain
Winter gray and falling rain
(Gonna happen every time)
We'll see summer come again
(Oh no, it just ain't mine)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(Just like a song that's born to soar the sky)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 2]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck

Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
And you use, them old U.S. Blues
Drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, oh, my, my, oh, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Now come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Well, come on, honey, come on home with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, come on over from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window, going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singing, I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, well, come on over, daydream
(Come on over, daydream)
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, come on over, sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, well, come on, sleep in my daydream
Sunshine daydream, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, ooh-hoo
Sunshine daydream, oh oh
Sunshine daydream, oh oh
Sunshine daydream, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
We gonna daydream
Thank you, good night

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits River Junction
At seventeen to
A quarter to ten
You know it's travelin' again

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
The Lady in Red
Take my advice
You'd be bеtter off dead
Switchman's sleepin'
Train hundred and two
Is on thе wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Drivin' that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Oh, trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Oh, across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to mе
Let me lay 'neath thе roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 1 repeated]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Outro]
Alright, folks, now it's time for America's favorite fun game, Step Back. Now, when I say the word, everybody take a step back. Okay, is everybody ready? Okay, let go. Step back, and take another step back, and take another step back, and take another step back, and take another step back. Now, doesn't everybody feel better?

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followеd her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die (Easy now)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (He's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Ain't nothin' gonna bring him back now)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
('Cause he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York has got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Now most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
And most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on (Easy now)

[Verse 4]
I was sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
I got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
And knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Hey, hey
Hey now, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken years and vanished dreams

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And there's just a song, comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street there's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
Then you hear that song, come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Reaching to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night!
Uh-huh, onе more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, thе President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, take out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night!
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Na, na, na, na, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Everybody get down (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo, yeah
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Thank you all, good night

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Hey, folks, down in front, there's this fence here and it's got some sharp wire on the top of it, and you're stupid if you climb on it, because it's gonna cut ya. Well, don't climb on the fence, idiot. Hey, folks, we came here to have a good time and listen to music, and not to trade punches or get in anybody's face

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
Rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
Well, I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
And everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Thеir walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on mе

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Outro]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on Earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God told me, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, you know I'll spend my life in jail

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Verse 1]
Said I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
You know she wished she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Say the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Thеy say the preacher man call mе a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Verse 3]
Well, a couple shots of whiskey women 'round here start looking good
A couple shots of whiskey women, these Frisco girls start looking good
A couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
"T" for Texas, yes, and it's a "T" for Timbuktu
Yeah, it's a "T" for Texas, yes, and it's a "T" for Timbuktu
Yes, and it's a "T" for San Francisco
Where the little girls know what to do

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men

[Outro]
Do it again
Said my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from other men

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child who rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down

Wait until that deal come ’round

Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

Come on you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes 'round again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
It'd be onе less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you'rе doing well
If I had me a shotgun
You know I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey around

Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way

Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
The little red rooster is on the prowl

If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
You know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down
Go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down
Go down

Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time

Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time

[Verse 1]
Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine one summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
The seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn it

[Chorus]
Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside
But a raging beast with nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music's thundering
We're restless and hot
You keep on firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like, feel like a stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show
Let's go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels
Just like running a red light
Well, there ain't no point in looking behind us, no

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like, feel like a stranger, like a stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna get stranger
If it's love then how would I know?
How would I know? How would I know?
If it's real love then how would I know?
How would I know? How would I know?
If it's real love then how would I know?

[Outro]
Feel like a stranger
(Just like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger
(Feel like, feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
(Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night)
Feel like a stranger
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
(Hey, crazy, hey, crazy, hey, crazy night)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get on, get out of the door
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to slow him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on your feet
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat
But you're hеre alone, therе's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
That thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
But then again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
Said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't closе the door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
Said, "You can't closе the door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
It's here ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama came quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Intro]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul
Good night

[Intro]
Got it on Smash

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuck all that talkin', I'm back with that 7.62 and it's spittin'
I got a bad lil' bitch fuckin' on anybody in the room, that'll get her Givenchy
Holdin' the vibe at the condo, I don't need nobody
No entry for niggas that envy
She set a threesome up, I fucked her friend
She got jelly, now she on Twitter actin' petty
Sent my other bitch a whip and got wetty
My diamonds bustin' down the wrist in baguettie
I hit his bitch and he couldn't accept it
Bitch, I got all type of sticks, I got invested
Whole lotta gateway
All my niggas in jail, I got you through the JPay
Rockefeller guap, Sky-Dweller watch
But we all started at the Day-Datе
Hit the dealer, comе back with another car
Hit the jeweler, come back with another watch
Hit that bih from the back and I let her watch
El Dorado, the cap with the yellow top
I done shopped 'til I dropped in Givenchy
Been on top since I dropped in the Bentley
When that day come around and I buss up the case
Don't you niggas come back actin' friendly
After this, I don't fuck with you rappin' niggas
Bitch, I'm good in the trap with the savages
Plus, I'm good in the board with the business niggas
Get the fuck out my face, mind your business
Different angles, I'ma watch it, colorblind
Bagged your bitch and I fucked her some other time
Make a hit, then I go make another song
I got nothin' to lose on you fuck niggas
I been in this shit here for like ten years
I got nothin' to prove, all you fuck niggas
No award in the world could define me, nigga
I got bad bitches think it's timey, nigga
Cell me, let me know if it's cool to fuck
You could pull up on me uninvited, ha
And then I smoke the pussy like a spliff
I light it, I'ma throw a party, every bitch invited
I'ma get money fasho, yeah
No, I cannot do no regular
I'm in running for trapper, trapper of the year
I'm juggin' off four different cellulars
Tell my teachers, "Fuck you, you can't tell me nothin'"
Shut the fuck up while I pull a Bentley up
I've been shinin' so bright, now they envy us
Wonder how them niggas feel that set me up
I done witnessed my nigga Kellz go to jail and come back and hop in a Urus
Different bitches gettin' bagged like 

[?] 

[1:29]
Take your bitch right back from you, I'm courteous
If a chick cheat on me, she ain't serious
She must not give a fuck 'bout her paper
She must not give a fuck 'bout her majors
Even if her other nigga major, that nigga ain't gettin'

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & EST Gee]
More paper than me
I got bad little bitches, they waitin' on me
I'm a young nigga, gettin' this paper for free
Bitch, I'm young and single, don't be waitin' on me
Tuh, tuh
Dead presidential paper on me
How you lookin' up to me but hatin' on me?
I'm a young nigga, gotta get this shit, get this shit
Tuh, tuh
Got bad little bitches, they waitin' on me
I'm a young nigga, gettin' this paper for free
Bitch, I'm young and single, don't be waitin' on me

Dead presidential paper on me
How you lookin' up to me but hatin' on me?
I'm a young nigga, gotta get this shit, get this shit
Tuh, tuh (Yeah, tell them niggas)

[Verse 2: EST Gee]
Yeah, I make 'em renew they membership
Niggas is new to this spinnin' shit
We was up one day, we gambled with it
Tripled the gravity, he had to remember it
He caught a face shot and lived with it
But when he talk, now he spittin' shit
Practice and preachin', no hypocrite, bond was a million
I'm spinnin' and can't let 'em sit, and I'm with 'em, whatever the endin' is
I'm on an island with killers, on Gilligan
I ain't no regular citizen, trippin', I'll fuck around and up the innocent
Talkin' tough, you know he been a bitch, secure the premises
Choppa and swisher when I enter in
I'm tryna finish him, whoever he post a picture with
Niggas be bitches, they sensitive, rappin' but not really livin' it
I'm in a rental, I tint it, it's spinnin'
We miss 'em and spin again, that's how we settle our differences
I still be bendin', I'm really rich
Bitch nigga, you a gentleman, in the streets, I'm goated
Niggas be hoes and I know it
Hittin' his phone, I know niggas ain't focused
All of my bitches love breakin' in local
That's why they hatin' on me
Can't say they gettin' more paper than Gee

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Not more paper than me
I got bad little bitches, they waitin' on me
I'm a young nigga, gettin' this paper for free
Bitch, I'm young and single, don't be waitin' on me
Tuh, tuh
Dead presidential paper on me
How you lookin' up to me but hatin' on me?
I'm a young nigga, gotta get this shit, get this shit
Tuh, tuh
Got bad little bitches, they waitin' on me
I'm a young nigga, gettin' this paper for free
Bitch, I'm young and single, don't be waitin' on me
Tuh, tuh
Dead presidential paper on me
How you lookin' up to me but hatin' on me?
I'm a young nigga, gotta get this shit, get this shit
Tuh, tuh

[Verse 3: VV$ Ken]
I'm on my time and I do what I wanna do
In the hood, sellin' birds with a bird in the air (Brrd)
Let me know if you want you a brick or two
Ride around with a stick or two
One of 'em dirty, it really got busy, it killed a few
Take a bullet so big, if I shoot it, I'm movin' 'cause I know it'll really kill a crew
Money set like Gorilla Glue
It came right out of the safe and them ten thousand bands
Swipin' cards and I'm trappin', I just signed a deal, I'ma go out and throw my advance
All it took was a chance and now I got paper on me, and I get it the quickest (Frrr, frrr)
Niggas know not to play with me, I'm Magic Johnson, I'm shootin', they know I'm the sickest
Call her bluff like a cricket
She wanna come over, bend while I stick it
I take my time on that cat while I lick it
I take my time on the beat when I pick it
I caught a opp and I shot him like Ricky
I like my filet with lettuce and mayo
I'm breakin' up rap like Saweetie and Quavo
Pull up on oppers like I'm playin' Halo
I nutted in shawty 'cause she looked like JLo

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Not more paper than me
I got bad little bitches, they waitin' on me
I'm a young nigga, gettin' this paper for free
Bitch, I'm young and single, don't be waitin' on me
Tuh, tuh
Dead presidential paper on me
How you lookin' up to me but hatin' on me?
I'm a young nigga, gotta get this shit, get this shit
Tuh, tuh
Got bad little bitches, they waitin' on me
I'm a young nigga, gettin' this paper for free
Bitch, I'm young and single, don't be waitin' on me
Tuh, tuh
Dead presidential paper on me
How you lookin' up to me but hatin' on me?
I'm a young nigga, gotta get this shit, get this shit
Tuh, tuh

Break out the food and the drinks, it's gonna be a party (Well)

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Although we didn't have much, we still had each other
And what we went through, we went through it together (Well)
We stick together, said through thick or thin
I thank God for family and all our day-one friends
Ah-ah, ah-ha, ah-ah (Haha)
We about to do the family and friends dance right now

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg, Ronald Isley]
I shuffle my feet and move to the left (Ooh)
I check my outfit, I'm so fresh to death
Hand my drink to wifey and sit my cup down
Now the whole fam-bam gettin' down
I mean, I mean, I just had a plate of them greens
I'm on the dance floor groovin' like a dancing machine
I got my mind on my money like I usually do
I wanna be livin' for the love of you
See, it's your thing, so do what you wanna do
'Cause you gon' have a good time when you in front of Snoop
And that's for sure though
My mama say stop the music 'cause she wanna take a photo
So we oblige and step to the side (Come on, come on)
Now the whole fam doin' the Electric Slide (Bring it in, y'all)
Like that, one, two (One, two)

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
Do you remember?

Woah-oh-oh, let's stay together
Hey, we gotta stay together
Hey, gotta stay together
Hey, stay together, hey, stay together
Hey, stay together, yeah, stay together
Hey, stay together, woah-oh

[Verse 1]
My brain feels heavy like too much TV
It's weighing on me like a pound of concrete
I know he wants me and that makes me happy
So why do I feel so weird?
It's foggy in my head, like clouds in a storm
The wind's pickin' up, I'm boltin' my shit to the floor
But when I'm with him, my shit gets ignored
Is that why I feel so weird?

[Chorus]
I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

[Verse 2]
I don't like getting attached
It makes me feel like I've done something bad
'Cause I'm not depеndent, and I know that
So why am I scared I'm reliving that part of my past?

[Chorus]
'Causе I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found
Oh, I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

[Bridge]
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

[Outro]
This boy that I've found, mmm
Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro]
Look

[Verse]
I should've listened to my friends
When they told me not to fuck with you, yeah
I was so blinded I guess, but I guess that's what love'll do, oh
Deleted our texts and our calls, I can't stand the thought of it
With somebody new, oh, told me he does the things I never do
That I never do, the problem is

[Chorus]
I always give my attention, oh, to the wrong girl
Attention, oh, to the wrong one
Attention, oh, I think the problem is
I always give my attention...

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
All babies together, everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
A nation planted, so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain
And far too many feeling the strain
Oh, when will there be a harvest for the world

[Verse 3: Ronald Isley]
Gather every man, gather every woman
Celebrate your lives, givе thanks for your children
Gather evеryone, gather all together
Overlooking none, hoping life gets better for the world
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Outro dialogue]
Ralph Johnson: That is a great song with a great message, and I love the chord changes in that song. I'm telling you, man, that's a great song
Ronald Isley: That's another one that Ernie wrote
Steve Harvey: Ernie, you wrote that, too?
Ernie Isley: I wrote that one, too
Ralph: That's a great song. That's a great song
Philip Bailey: Can you loan me about fifty dollars?
*laughter*
Steve: Come on, D-Nice

[Intro dialogue]
Steve Harvey: Okay, now, D-Nice, I want you to give me four sexy, I want four love songs in a row, uninterrupted, D-Nice
D-Nice: Uninterrupted?
Steve: Uninterrupted. I want you to go Isley, Earth, Isley, Earth
D-Nice: Oh
Steve: Four sexy ass...
D-Nice: Alright, let's start it off, Steve
Steve: Come on, boy; come on, boy

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Oh, I've been thinking of you
And you've been thinking of me
Oh, I'll give all that I have
If you'll give all that I need

[Interlude: D-Nice]
We gon' keep it sexy, let's go

[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley]
And oh, oh, oh, let's be fair
And I think it's time we cleared the air
You've been watching me, I've been watching you
You know I've been wantin' to

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
(Groove with you)
Girl, speak your mind
(Groove with you)
You been thinking all of this time
(Groove with you)
Oh baby, what I wouldn't do
(Groove with you)
Just spending my days with you

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slips away
Because your baby is so far away

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Ooh, his old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
But I, I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
These old arms of mine miss having you around
Makes these tears inside start pouring down

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
Always with half a kiss
You remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Likе a fool I start grinnin' 'cause my head starts spinnin'...

[Intro: Steve Harvey]
Hey D-Nice, let's get it real sexy in here. Come on

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
Hello, hello
Oh, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, girl
Hello, hello, oh
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, ooh

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Hello, it's me, it's me, baby
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something's here that doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
I can't help it, baby
Seeing you, yeah, seeing anyone as much as I do you
I take for grantеd that you're always there
I takе for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through, baby
You know why, ah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley]
It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
No, don't change, girl
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
Stay as sweet as you are, baby
(Don't change, don't change, girl)
But one thing I want you to do is

[Outro: Steve Harvey]
Boy, we was doing background for yo' ass on that one, Ron. Woo-hoo-hoo. Come on, D-Nice

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know, yeah
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see, yeah

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
No, no, no, no

[Intro: D-Nice]
Let's go

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
Ah-ha-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
Ah-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
No, no, no, no, it's all in my mind
No, no, no, no, it's all in my mind

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Oh, summer breeze
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind
It's all in my mind, ooh

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Lets me know every, everything's alright
Oh, summer

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
(Oh, summer breeze)
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home...

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me, woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
It's your thing (It's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing (It's your thing), do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you who to sock it to

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Alright
Ah, have mercy

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Ah, it's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to, hit me, man
It's your thing (It's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love, girl, to whoever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
It's your thing (It's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing (It's your thing), do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you who to sock it to (Woo)

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
Let me hear ya say, "It's my thing"

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Can I go on my way without you?
Woah-oh, how can I know?
If I go on my way without you
Woah-oh, where would I go?

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Set sail with me
Misty lady, set my spirit free
New love to find
And though I leave another behind

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)

She's my lady, now and ever
Woah-oh, how can I know?
Can we go all the way together?
Woah-oh, let it be so

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
So we'll say our last goodbye
And we'll make it this time
Ho-oh, oh, set sail with me
To a paradise out beyond the sea

Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)

Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see
Darlin', you're the promise everlasting
Ah, and where you are I hope to be

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes, you are, you're all, all...
You're all I need, oh yes, you are
You're all I need

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
Whatever pain's inside, you make it better
Ah, you seem to realize when I'm concerned
You are the only one who goes through the changes
Ah, giving my life directions if I am turned

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes, you are, you're all, all...

How am I worthy of love from an angel?
Princess imperial of my soul
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer
Hoping that what I've revealed you already know

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl, yeah

[Intro: Steve Harvey]
Come on, D-Nice. Uh-oh, that's "Footsteps," baby. Oh, you had to get somebody and head to the dance floor on this one right here. Soon as you hear that drum beat, that's "Footsteps in the Dark," man. I was in high school

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions going on elsewhere

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

My mind drifts now and then
Looking down dark corridors and wondеrs what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hеy, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
I, I keep hearing footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearing footsteps baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
Honey, now let's stop walking around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in going elsewhere?

And I'll make you so happy

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]

Choosey lover
Girl, I'm so proud of you
I'm so glad you chose me, baby, baby
And I'll make you so happy

[Outro dialogue]
Steve Harvey: So we was laughing during these records 'cause Ron, how did you come up with that song?
Ronald Isley: I was trying to -- I heard the record "True Devotion," and I was so in love with that song, I said, "I want a song like that." So that's when I wrote "Choosey Lover." And I was afraid that I was gonna get sued because it was so close, so close. That was before I knew Philip like I know him now and Verdine like I know him now. My brother used to call Verdine on the phone all the time
Verdine White: Right. And Marvin told me about the song, right, right. Love him
Steve: But y'all didn't care
Verdine: True compliment
Steve: True compliment?
Verdine: Absolutely, especially from them, from The Isley Brothers, are you kidding? Right. You know, if they love your stuff, you must be doing something good because we love their stuff, you know?
Steve: One more, D-Nice

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Here is a story, about a man coming in
And finding his woman in bed with...
Well, listen

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
It's 2 A.M. I'm just getting in about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her has she seen my baby
Roll my six around looking for that missing lady
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somеthings going on upstairs
And I know nobody else lives hеre
(Bump bump bump) As I get closer to the stairways all I hear
Then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screaming out....

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got
(and then a man said)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(And I just can't believe this shit)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
I ran downstairs looked in the closet looking for that ooh
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplating not in my own damn house
Who would have thought she was creeping with another man?
The down low happening to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down
'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound, something going on upstairs
'Cause I know no one else lives here
(Bump bump bump) As I get closer to the stairways all I hear
Then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screamin'

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got
(And then a man said)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(All I can do is hear them say)
You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got
(Woah-oh-oh)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(All I can do is hear them say)

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
Well...

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley, JS]
Busted, it's 2 o'damn clock in the morning, where you been?
(Baby, didn't you get my 2-way? I was with my girlfriend)
You a liar, I called Keisha and Tanya and they were both at home

But they're the only friends I know
Girl, you better
(Wait before you get all upset, here's the truth)
Talk to me

And...?
(Her man cheated, had her upset and confused)
But baby what's that got to do with you coming in at 2?
I'm telling you
(Now shе was so upset, she asked mе to stay with her)
Well why didn't your ass just pick up the phone and call me?

Let me tell you where I've been)
Well, quit wasting my time
And say what's on your mind, tell me
(Fine, me and some girlfriends) Uh-huh
We went dancing (Who?)
(Me, Shaniqua, Shaquan, and Robin)
Well, if y'all were going shopping
Why didn't you just check in?
(I was but then I thought my cellular was off)
Now earlier (Hmm) you said dancing (Uh)
But when I just asked (Hmm) you said shopping (Uh)
Tell me which one you were doing
(Oh baby, I must be confused)
Yeah right, you real confused

[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley, JS]
Tell me where you been? (Dancing)
Dancing where? (Um...)
The name of the club? (Kisses)
What time it end? (I think one or two)
What time it end? (Three, four)
Here's one thing I gotta know
At first you say dancing
But now you say shopping

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, R. Kelly]
Go upstairs (Busted)
Pack your bags ('Cause you busted)
While you at it (Busted)
Call a cab ('Cause you busted)
It's obvious (Busted)
You played around ('Cause you busted)
Go upstairs and get your ****
And get the **** up out of here now

[Verse 3: Ronald Isley , JS]
(Baby, I'm a victim of circumstances) Oh
(Why you don't believe me? I don't understand it)
Trying to slick a can of oil who you think you fooling
Now get on out my face (Baby)
Before I catch another case (Wait)

[Chorus: Ronald Isley + JS + R. Kelly]
Go upstairs (Busted)
Pack your bags (I don't wanna)
(Cause you busted)
While you at it (Busted)
Call a cab (A cab for what?)
(Cause you busted)
Its obvious (Busted)
You played around (No, I'm not)
(Cause you busted)
Go upstairs and get your **** (No)
And get the **** up out of here now

[Outro - Ron Isley + (JS)]
(No, innocent, innocent, innocent, I'm innocent)
No, you guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty
(Oh, now wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute)
Go upstairs and get your ****
And get the **** up out of here, tell me
(Tell me, where am I suppose to go from here)
Frankly my...

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady (Who's that lady?)

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Hear me calling out to you
'Cause that's all that I can do
Your eyes tell me to pursue
But you say "Look yeah, but don't touch, baby"
Nah, nah, nah don't touch

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]
Who's that lady (Who's that lady?)
Sexy lady (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady (Who's that lady?)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley, The Isley Brothers]

Any gift she'd want I'd bring

If she would just do what I say
Come 'round my way, baby
Shine my way

Who's that lady (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady (Who's that lady?)

But her heart is made of stone
Gotta keep on keepin' on
If I don't she'll do me wrong
Do me wrong, yeah

[Ernie Isley guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
So I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
Hеy, I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Wеll, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
Hey, I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
The women got the men like a puppet show

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Little boy sit on the corner and cry
Big man come and he ask him why
He said, "I can't do what the big boys do"
The man sat down and he cried, too

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Ever since the world began
Women been imitating the ways of man
But listen here, I've got a plan
Give it up, boys, don't try and understand

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
The women got the men like a puppet show

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter

That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right

[Outro]
That's right, the women are smarter

That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
That's right

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle
Or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now
I can feel it my feet now
Listen, here it comes again

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
So come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun wеnt down in honey
And the moon came up in winе
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us too busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on

[Bridge]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You know you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winnеr take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sorе
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it just couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to me
Let me lay 'neath the roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see what you done done
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see what you done done
Girl, now you made me love you, woman
And now your man done gone

[Verse 2]
So I'm goin' away, baby, and I won't be back 'til fall
Well, I'm goin' away, baby, and I won't be back 'til fall
If I could find me that good girl, I might not be coming back at all
Maybe not at all

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well now C, C.C. Rider, see how the moon is shining bright
Way above the clouds tonight, C.C. Rider
See now the moon is shining bright
Just might find me that good girl, and everything would be alright
Alright

[Verse 3]
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done

Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Well, now you made me love you, woman
And now your man has come

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Leave nothin' for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up and one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settlе down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundrеd verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change
Try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
Well, I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'll be waiting at thе station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I'm going back where I bеlong
Baby, I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Hey, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Well, and, that's where I think I belong
Hey now, got a sweet woman, Lord, oh yeah, she's waiting there for me
Hey, and that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy, I said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, hey hey (Happy home)
Happy home, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
My back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me, "Now, cool down, boy
Settle back easy, Jim"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extremе

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are gеtting most concerned
Loose with the truth, maybe it's your fire
But baby I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
I told Althea I'm a roving sign
I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
You know, now I'm out trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Talking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, widе and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in thе furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We'll be right back

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
It ain't no luck, I learned to duck

Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
I've been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, old Charlie Chan
Light your fuse, shine your shoes
And you usе, them old U.S. Blues
Share your wеalth, drink your health
Run your life, I'll steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, oh, my, oh, my, my, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Thank y'all

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
Well, the sun will shine in my back door someday, hey, hey
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Gotta get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a littlе more ground
Bound to cover just a little morе ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry this today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Reaching to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, 'cause it's Saturday night now
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, ah, Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, onе more Saturday night now
One more Saturday night now
Right now, right now, right now

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on my TV, thе President comes on the news
Said, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, take out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
One more Saturday night now

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night now
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Right now, right now, right now

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Everybody get right now (One more Saturday night)
Right now, right now (One more Saturday night)
Uh-huh, one more Saturday now, hey

Vanilla Saturday night
Hey, hey (One more Saturday night)

One more Saturday, one more Saturday
Right now, right now

Thank you
Yeah
I've been tryin' to call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge mе (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gonе
And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
(Hey, hey, hey)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

[Verse 1]

[...] fades away
I'd trade the gold for you any day
What does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need the pretty lights
No recognition for tonight
I, I just wanna live my life, oh
Calling out my fuckin’ name
I’m a human yes, I say
I’m the same way as I came, oh

[Chorus]
I want you to love me, I want you to love me
If I had no-nothing no more
Would you say that you love me?
Say that you love me?
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more

[Verse 2]
Oh, I, I wanna go in deep
Show you what’s underneath
What does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah
So I’m giving you all of me
What you get now is what you see
That’s what I mean, that’s what I mean
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need the pretty lights
No recognition for tonight
I, I just wanna live my life, oh
Calling out my fuckin’ name
I’m a human yes, I say
I’m the same way as I came, oh

[Chorus]
I want you to love me, I want you to love me
If I had no-nothing no more
Would you say that you love me?
Say that you love me?
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more
If I had no-nothing no more

[Verse 1]
Let me see your passport
Please take off your glasses
Got to get through customs, taxi, baggage
You know you still love me
Sicily to the UK
Keep them hands up everywhere, follow me
I'm about to take you abroad

[Pre-Chorus]
Show up in your town
Second that I'm touching down
Go someplace we’ve been
Every time I'm with my friends
Sexy men whisper foreign in my ear
"She’s so hot"
You so naughty come on show me what you got
What you got

[Chorus]
Looked in the mirror today
Thought I had so much to say
But now that I'm face to face
I feel like running away
(I need a)
Think I just I need a getaway
Time for a break, a holiday
Timе that I make my great escapе
I need it now
I need it today
I need it today

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know where I'm going but I know I'm outta here
Don't know where I'm going but I know I'm outta here
I-I know where I'm going, yes I know I'm outta here
I'm going abroad, I'm going abroad

[Verse 2]
I don’t speak the language
But they know my name here
Frequent flier mileage
Platinum next year
"Bonjour" in France
Keep my head wrapped up in Hermes
Tropical destination
Get my rest and my relaxation abroad

[Pre-Chorus]
Show up in your town
Second that I'm touching down
Go someplace we’ve been
Every time I'm with my friends
Sexy men whisper foreign in my ear
"She’s so hot"
You so naughty come on show me what you got
What you got

[Chorus]
Looked in the mirror today
Thought I had so much to say
But now that I'm face to face
I feel like running away
(I need a)
Think I just I need a getaway
Time for a break, a holiday
Time that I make my great escape
I need it now

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know where I'm going but I know I'm outta here
Don't know where I'm going but I know I'm outta here
I-I know where I'm going, yes I know I'm outta here
I'm going abroad, I'm going abroad (Abroad)

[Bridge]
Today
I need a change of pace
To see some different faces
I need to get away
I need a break from you
(I need a break for me)
I need a break from you
(I need a break for me)
Give me a break from here
(Give me a break, I need a break)
Somewhere that I can clear my head
I need it (I'm going abroad, I'm going abroad)
I need it (I'm going abroad, I'm going abroad)

[Chorus]
Looked in the mirror today
Thought I had so much to say
But now that I'm face to face
I feel like running away
(I need a)
Think I just I need a getaway
Time for a break, a holiday
Time that I make my great escape
I need it now
I need it today
I need it today

[Outro]
Don't know where I'm going but I know I'm outta here
There was a time when you were mine
There was a time when you held me tight
But now you aren't around me
Boy I wish you could find me, oh

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Wants you again
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Loves you, my friend

Now you're gone, you left me
What's a girl do, so pressed, you see
And right when I saw the door
You walked in and I fell to the floor, yeah

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Wants you again
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Loves you, my friend

Every day I wake up and you're not there, no, no
It takes too much of me, I just can't spare
So why, tell me why, why did you go away, away
This girls gonna be all alone, so come back to me, come back to me
Oh, why did you go
I feel so alone

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Wants you again
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Loves you, my friend

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Wants you again
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Loves you, my friend

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Wants you again
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss just
Loves you, my friend

Lyrics from snippet:
Leon Thomas III:

My darling angel
Won't you spread your wings oh-oh

Post Malone:

I ain't the one you need
I ain't the one you need

???

[Intro: Ludacris]
Yeah, yeah, haha
Luda!
DTP, oh
Classic shit
I'm in here sippin’ on this Conjure
I'mma tell you like this, look

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I met this chick in Motor City
And her name was Lexus
Ass out of control and her chest was wreckless
So we exchanged numbers
Plenty calls and texts about gaining
New friends and X-ing our exes
In the back of my mind
I just wanted to sex this
Gotta give her the D
And some pearls as her necklace
So, I had her for dinner
Woke her up for breakfast
Around seven thirteen like Houston, Texas
She's everything I hoped for, in the bedroom
And like Tyra Banks, I need some headroom
Because she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose
I never sat her on the bench, she my starting hose
I’m on point at Game time
Y'all be guardin' hoes
Yeah, she never plays games like the Parker bros
And we be drinking Conjure by the cases
Meanwhile your girl's been exchanging fuck faces

[Hook: Trey Songz & Lil Wayne]
You must be used to all the finer things (yeah)
Infatuated by what money brings (Young Money, Cash Money, Rap-A-Lot 25th anniversary)
It seems to me, you hoes'll never change (ya dig)
(No, hoes won't ever change..) (ya dig)
So all that's left is for us to exchange.. (alright, listen)
Fuck faces

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I met her at a restaurant
She was a waitress
One day I went in and sat at her table
She asked me what will I be having?
I said "the basics, well-done steak, vegetables and potatoes”
She asked if I will be having a drink, I said "later"
Bring me a glass of vodka and a chaser
As me and my homie sat and discussed paper
I could feel a fire burning me like a laser
I could see her thighs
Through uniform pants, so I didn't leave a tip
I left her an advance
Along with my number saying "give me a call"
And you know I didn’t have to leave my name at all!
She called me when she got off
So I invited her to my loft
And she flew over like a moth thing
You know she came straight up outta all of that cloth
We had a couple blunts and some champagne
Then she massaged all of my back pains
Then it became time for her to pack things
I said hit me up again, we do the same thing
Jumped in the shower, got out and saw a text message
It had a smiley face and said “you the best sexy XOXO!”
I replied I love your fuck face

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
(No, hoes won’t ever change)
So all that's left is for us to exchange, fuck faces

[Verse 3: The Gator Main]

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
(No, hoes won’t ever change)
So all that's left is for us to exchange, fuck faces

[Outro]
Woo, woo, woo
Bitch get in, just sit 'n spin, she's listening
Cause I'm about to make a motherfucker go!

[Verse 1]
Don't know how to spin
But it can feel good just to
Move my limbs with the flow
I'll be your guy or I'll be your girl
If you wanna get down on the floor

[Hook]
Something's inside me
I feel like a god
Everything shaking in my eyes I see spots

[Verse 2]
I hear it again
Spinning through my head
Let the notes just sway out of tune
I could jump high
Or crawl to the floor
But I'm always just between the two
Maleena told me that the fruit will go bad
Live in this moment
Cus it could be your last

[Hook]
Lee Lee go round ring around the rose
In a dark lit club late at night
She cannot stop spin out of control
And her head just flies out of sight

[Outro]
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover
Dance with me I'll be your lover

[Verse 1]
Hey
Can you see
Black and red
Over me?
Can you believe
This whole thing?
What a dream

[Chorus]
Black and red
Black and red
Black and red...
My disease
My disease
My disease

[Verse 2]
Runs down my cheek
What I breathe what I eat
Strawberry seeds
Like the shoes on my feet
Like the shoes on my feet
Like the shoes on my feet

[Outro]
My disease...
Black and red...
Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the Marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke
Gun smoke guns smoke
Biggie smalls for mayor
The rap slayer
The hooker layer
Motherfucker say your prayers
Hail mary full of grace
Smack the bitch in the face
Take her guccci bag and the north face
Off her back
Jab her if she act
Funny with the money
Oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape Ya, I just want the paper
The visa, capeesha
I'm out like, like thе vapors
Who's the one you call Mr macho
The hеad hancho
Swift fist like Camacho I got so
Much style I should
Be down with the stylistics
Make up to breakup
Niggas need to wake up
Smell the indonesia
Beat you to seizure
Then fuck your moms
Hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit
Just the two hits
Her hitting the floor
And me hitting the clit
Suckin on the tits
Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your mom's ain't ugly love
My dick got Rock quick
I guess I was
A combination
Of house of pain and Bobby brown
I was humping around and jump In around
Jacked her
Then I asked her who's the man
She said B.i.G
Then I bust in her E.Y.E
(you big, your dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it Goin on
Youre dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it Goin on
When I get dusted
I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it my hardcore rainleaves you rusted
Move over lucifer I'm more ruthless huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbutz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me
I hit em with the tec
Gs disrespect me
My potency is deadly
I'm shooting babies
No ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy
If the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from da back
But smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin in a room
Fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealing with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it
Hardcore I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab Ya till you're gushy
So please don't push me
I'm using rubbers
So they won't trace the semen
The black demon
GOT the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young
Fresh of green
With no hair in between
Know what I mean?
The weak or the strong
Who got it Goin on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it Goin on
Your dead wrong

[Intro]
Ahh, ooh
(Aaaah, oooh)

[Verse 1]
We can live underwater
It ain't hard
When you never been a part
Of the country on dry land
We used to be smarter
We taught 'em what they know
And now we got to show 'em
What it means to be American

Good life, liberty
Innovation (Innovation)
Every child
No matter what color
Gettin' an education (An education)
Now life in the hood
Is nothin' but fear
One thousand light years away from here

[Chorus]
One thousand light years from here
Oh
I'm talkin' about a peaceful resolution
One thousand light yеars away from here
One thousand light yеars from here
Come on
One thousand light years from here
We need a spiritual resolution
One thousand light years from here

[Verse 2]
You can dream in color
When you let go
Of the proverbial
"You got to crawl before you walk"
Mmm (I told you so, oh)
Listen to me now, brother
(Listen to me)
Like the motion of the stars we are
(We are)
So you might as well come on
Let's go (Let's slide)
Hey (Stop talkin')

Baby dreamin' about...
A new world order
Ahh
But it's just a nightmare
If you still got borders, oh
Wouldn't you rather have me near?
Or one thousand light years away from here

[Chorus]
One thousand light years from here
Come on
One thousand light years from here
And a peaceful resolution
One thousand light years from here

[Bridge]
Why would God make heaven so far away? (So far away)
A whole world of His children
Cryin' to Him everyday
Maybe it's time we all stop the rain
I'm just saying
Ahh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If you're sick of cryin'
And tired of tears
Then close your eyes
And open your ears
Listen to the music, listen to the song
Listen to your heart, is that so wrong?
Stop lookin' in the mirror, there's nothin' to fear
Your salvation is near
One thousand light years away from here

[Chorus]
One thousand light years from here
(One thousand light years away from here)
It's here
If you want to be
C'mon,hey
So what you need to do, y'all
Is start lookin' outside urself
Just clap your hands
Don't understand
But they keep sellin' lies
To keep people buyin'
You can live forever!
Without even tryin'
No more dyin'
No more
Whoo
Ooh
One thousand light years from here
(One thousand light years away from here)
(One thousand light years away from here)
(One thousand light years away from here)
(One thousand light years away from here)
(One thousand light years away from here)
One thousand light years away from here
(One thousand light years away from here)
(One thousand light years away from here)
One thousand light years away from here
One thousand light years away from here
One thousand light years away from here
(So far)
(So far away)
One thousand light years away from here
(So far away)
(Take me there)

[Verse 1]
When she comes
She never closes her eyes
No
No, no
She can see (See) stars (Stars) shoot (Shoot)
All over her sky
Over and over and over
Over and over

[Verse 2]
When she comes
She never, ever holds her sighs
No, no
(No)
She can be so free
(She can be so free)
Occasionally
She cries
Over
Please don't ask me why
Oooh
I wanna turn you 'round
I want to hear those sounds
You know which sounds
Like a tornado
(Round and round like a tornado)
A tornado
(Up and down, up and down)
Touching down, oh
Over and over
When she comes
She comes

[Interlude]
Where am I?
Alone, all alone
Around and around
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Aaah

[Verse 3]
When she comes
She walks around like she's all this and all that
Like her ish don't stank
Y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I think you do
Some people might think it's rude
But she's more comfortable in the nude
At first I thought she was a prude
(At first I thought she was a prude)
But now she's the first and last thing I ever wanna do
Shootin' stars every day and night
'Cause when my woman comes
She comes
She comes
She comes

[Intro]
Call to all the women
Call to the men
What could be stranger than the times we're in?
Earthquake, flood, y'all better hurry, kin
Ask the Lone Ranger
Rin Tin Tin

[Verse 1]
Flowin' just like water through the sands of time
To the marrow of the bone and the eye of the mind
Like drink if you're thirsty and sight if you're blind
We got to let the funk unwind
(Oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Sons of God and the daughters of men
Enmity between us since the fall began (Fall)
What about genetics do we not understand?
Maybe we should listen to the band
The band

[Refrain]
Rin Tin Tin
Earthquake, flood
Y'all better hurry, kin
Ask the Lone Ranger
Rin Tin Tin

[Verse 3]
Analog people
In a digitial world
Too much information make your hair curl
Nothing left to value
If it's all the same kind
We got to let the funk unwind
Ooh

Ooh, Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin

[Verse 4]
Whether you're a boss or a sucker
(Best to be like water)
Just lookin' for stock
(Water)
You're still a second hand
(Best to be like water)
On your master's clock
(Water)
Oh, it's best to be like water
There's no vibration in rock
Meet me in between the atoms
Beethoven and Bach

[Bridge]
Faith and the nobleman to lead you
Through the wilderness of life
That he taught you
Now has brought you
To the truth about time
There's no such thing

[Refrain]
What could be stranger in 1010?
(Rin Tin Tin)
Ask the Lone Ranger
(Rin Tin Tin)
Get' em, girl
Ah
Better better better hurry, kin
(Rin Tin Tin)
Oh
We need to let the funk unwind

[Verse 5]
Here come the jury
Talkin' about good and bad
Laughter n their eyes
From the power they had
Check, check the watches
Can somebody please
Tell me the real time
("Man, what time is it?")
They got to let the funk unwind
Oh yeah! (Wind)

[Refrain]
Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin

Ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Prince and Shelby J.]
You go to bed just to learn
It was all a dream
Day after day just a yearnin'
For something in between
Kneeling down beside your bed
Praying for a sign
And everything your mama said
Is just a waste of time

[Refrain: Prince and Shelby J.]
But one day, one day
We'll all be free

[Verse 2: Prince and Shelby J.]
You go to church just to be sold
Why you deserve to die
It's just like having your fortune told
But never asking why
Or more like having one of God's creations
Tied up on a leash (Uh-uh)
Makes you wonder who controls the nations
If we never had peace

[Refrain: Prince and Shelby J.]
One day, one day
We'll all be free

[Interlude: Shelby J., Liv Warfield, and Elisa Fiorillo]
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 3: Prince]
You go to school just to learn
About what never existed
But if your history only burns
It's better to resist it
Keepin' it Franklin, Benjamin Banneker
Was never born a slave
And-ah if George Washington never told no lie
Maybe we'd all be saved

[Refrain: Prince and Shelby J.]
One day, one day
We'll all be free

[Refrain: Prince, Shelby J., Liv Warfield, and Elisa Fiorillo]
One day, one day
We'll all be free
One day, one day
We'll all be free
One day, one day
We'll all be free

[Refrain: Prince]
One day, one day
We will all be free

[Outro: Shelby J., Liv Warfield, and Elisa Fiorillo & Prince]
One day, one day
We will all be free (Oh, yes we will, yes we will)
One day, one day (One day, one glorious day)
We will all be free
One day, one day
We will all be free (Talking about you, talking about me)
One day, one day
We will all be free (One day, one day, we will all be, all be free)
One day, one day
We will all be
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Listen, you look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' for me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like, field mob song, trill mob boy
She been MIA far too long, so far
Now catch the conversation, change the conversation
Dollars all I'm chasin', ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
Non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans, I got bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me (Bankroll)
Every time I tell you differently (Bankroll)
You and him just split, you tryna get with me (Bankroll)
Money be my interest, gotta get the green (Bankroll)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
The topic today, be the wallet
My lady be spendin', investin'
Whatever you goin', I wallop
Now I get out departments, wylin'
Why my jewelry looking like tuition to college
Whatever you do, do not stop it
If you wanna salad all up in your pocket
I must be addicted to only the process
Walk up, buy the diamond, the riches
Whenever they hear this, I wonder what this is
Stop in the field like the different to bridges
I feel like, this year we run that shit back, and I better keep hittin'
One of them rings on the finger like Rodman and Jordan and Pippen
I had epiphany, I wanna three-peat
I split the wave and they glisten like 

[?]
Back of the truck with the stack like I'm Scooby-Doo
Waggin' that tail like I'm chuggin' Don Julio
Bitch in the back and they starin' like, "Who are you?"
Bangin that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, that "Hootie Hoo"
Clutching my
Clutching my

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans of that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me (Bankroll)
Every time I tell you differently (Bankroll)
You and him just split, you tryna get with me (Bankroll)
Money be my interest, gotta get the green (Bankroll)

Nasty muhfucker

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Streetwalkin' baby
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (Never)
Be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Never)
Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'll never (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Never)
Be the same (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh

[Chorus]
And I never (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Never)
Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'll never (So you were never a saint) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Never)
(And I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain)
Be the same (Mosaic broken hearts) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(But this love is brave and wild) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

[Instrumental Break]
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

[Outro]
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a—, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I—

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a—, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were troublе when you walked in
So shame on mе now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will bе alright if
We just keep dancin' like we'rе
Twenty-two
Twenty-two

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleepin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey)
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancin' like we're
Twenty-two (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two
Twenty-two (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
Yeah, hey, yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey)
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh, oh-oh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancin' like we're (Dance like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Ooh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Twenty-two (Dancin' like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don’t
I almost do
I almost do

[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams, you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

[Outro]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, evеr, ever getting back togеther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, "I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"

[Chorus]
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Outro]
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simplе name
Everything has changed
All I know is you hеld the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, "Okay, let's talk"
And I said

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
(Ha-ha-ha, that's so fun)

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Gary Lightbody & Both]
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say, "It's been you all along"
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time I'm asking you this (This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)

[Outro: Both]
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of "I need you"
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Verse 1]
Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me

[Chorus]
'Cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

[Bridge]
Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us, we can't get back

[Chorus]
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

[Chorus]
What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 1]
New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

[Pre-Chorus]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

[Chorus]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

[Chorus]
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

[Chorus]
Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)

[Chorus]
Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Breakdown]
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

[Outro]
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

[Verse 2]
I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you nеver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Outro]
On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what wе do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)
(Follow you around)

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah-ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But therе was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knеw

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew

[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, еverybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got mе alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 2]
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn’t once been just like her

[Chorus]
So don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you’ve got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

[Chorus]
Don’t look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Outro]
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself, "Don't get attached"
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

[Pre-Chorus]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Breakdown]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Doctor, doctor, need you back home, baby
Doctor, doctor, where ya at? Give me something
I need your love, I need your love, I need your lovin'
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
My body needs a hero, come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird, oh
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, comе on and turn me on
Come on and turn me on

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Makе me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Make me come alive, come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life, come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die, come on and turn me on

[Outro]
Come on and turn me on
Maestro, guide the bass
Let's go, dance!

My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between

And I'm acting like an angel underneath
Even if I look like a fool, a devil
I am a bad boy but for my girl a soft teen
Even if I passed the point of eighteen

In the hallway, I reminisce
About the moments, you with me
Kissing you under the starlight baby
You with me, under the sheets

My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between
After the rave party, I see
Reflections of you, out in the streets
I cry baby but that's me
I love you more than you imagine

My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between

And even If I'm far, you're still in my heart
Printed forever like a pleasing scar
And at the midnight the stars. unite us
Angels of the insane real world
You're my secret Wonderland, oh oh
I need to xertz the whole sea
To save you from drowning
A striver to survive, yeah
Preventing you from falling

My baby feels so lonely
Out of the city wandering
And I'm just wondering
How to end the distance between

Oh between
How to end the space between?
You with me
Baby
I'm wondering

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Up in the sky
Up there in the sky, sky

[Verse 1: JOBA]
It's so easy living in delusion
All I see is an illusion
Lend a hand, I could use one
Skipping stars on a cloudy night
Hearing colors, seeing music
I can taste the air
Something like a love affair
Is only fair when it's pretend
In the chaos, I am still here

[Chorus: JOBA & Christian Alexander]
They'll never (They'll never) understand (understand)
They'll never (They'll never) understand (understand)
I like the way it hurts me
I like the way it hurts, god
They'll never (They'll never) understand (understand)
They'll never (They'll never) understand (understand)
I like the way it hurts me
I like the way it hurts me

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I fear for my life like the president
I'm loyal to my brothers like a, like a blood
Texas niggas where I get my genius from
Mama got some half brothers
And they from the same place where Stevie from
I be in the city, I don't let 'em come backstage
I'm afraid my family cursed
Why the fuck you think a nigga had to go and change his last name?
Yeah, I'm from the trash, it was do or die
Made it out alive, only the strong survive
Had to sell my soul to help my mama out
Never turn on your niggas for some clout
You forgetting how to take the trash out
Five hoes a night the last house
I'm throwing cash out
I made an ass out myself
Drunk as fuck in the airport
Probably kill ya if I tried to care more
Take my own life like it's a damn sport
Like it's Shakespeare
Nigga, eight years
No acres, on ay-ers
All my heroes from Chicago or Brooklyn
They a Laker

[Bridge: THE BLOSSOM]
As you sleep at night, the city's burning down to the ground
While I'm wide awake, I howl at the moon
All your dreams are never-ending circles keeping me around
But I'm just a man with nothing to lose

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
Keep the cameras rolling
I am just a man
I am just a man
Keep the cameras rolling

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
At your spot, 34 floors up
Quick with it, should've never froze up
Had your nose in things you shouldn't
Protected when I know I couldn't
Innocence stripped from the grip
Watch it slip out your tatted hands
On the phone, call and see how far they is
Man you playin' round, we was just some kids
Like ray trace 'round the TV set
I've been pretty gone, dog, you a vet
Lucky getting off with a minor offense
With the walls closing, holding up your head
Should've pulled you out, should've saw the stance
But you gonna do what you gonna do?
Sitting 'round the circle, faces turning purple
Same convo, same dead-end
Always tryna talk you out this damn lane
When you face all the things you left
Hanging over everybody
But they never show you all the pain that they carry
Out there shakin', slow fadin'
With self-hatred
Got my 

[?] my wrist up

[Outro: Matt Champion, Kevin Abstract & JOBA]
I will make it home okay
I will make it home okay

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a man
At least, I'm trying to be
But I've learned before
That other half of me
I said, I'm a man
Look across the deep blue sea
But I ain't gonna search
For nothing desperately
Hey, I'm trying, trying
Trying to keep my cool
Well, I'm trying to keep my gloom
Yea, yea, yea
Well, until I find that sweet love of mine
I'm just a rolling
Screaming, tumbling
Crying, girly loving, rolling stone

[Verse 2]
Hey, if you're a woman
At least, you say you are
You're a woman
At least, you look like you are
You're a woman
At least, you say you are
But you make it off, in bed with my guitar
And you leave the real me outside
To leave out, 'round the nighttime
You say you just want a ticket to ride
You don't give a damn about-

[Bridge]
You're just a screaming
Didn't love 'ya sometimes
But a, rolling, tumbling, stepping, stepping stone
That's all you-
Stepping stone

Yes, I find myself riding down the highways of desire

Look, never would've thought that you would be the only bitch to ever have my heart
My friends say that I'm trippin', but they never been in love
I tried wit' other bitches but you the only one
You're the only one I want, want
It's crazy that I put my trust into you, I don't usually do this

You the only one, that's for sure
Blocked all my hoes
Declinin' all of they calls, for you
May right all my wrongs
Shit, it ain't take long
But I did it all just because of you
All because of you I'm all in this position
Stuck between, "I love you" and "I'm trippin'"
Call me crazy, but that's how I'm feelin'
I think that I found what I was missin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust me girl, I'm all for you
Long as you promise to give me all of you (Uh-uh)
Trust me girl, I'm all for you
As long as you promise you got me too

And it's gonna leavе a big old nasty scar

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, "How the hell did you get there?"
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

[Verse 2]
There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age"
She said "You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

[Chorus]
Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

[Verse 3]
There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 4]
'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
In my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

[Chorus 2]
Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters grey
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin', bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

[Outro]
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint
when i think bAck on the fearless album and all that you turned it into, a completely involuntary smile creeps across my face. this was the musical era in which so many inside jokes were created between us, so many hugs exchanged and hands touched, so many unbreakable bonds formed. so before i say anything else, let me just say that it was a real honor to get to be a teenager alongside you. and for those of you i've come to know more recently than 2008, i am ecstatic that i'll get to exPerience a bit of that feeling with you in the very near future. now that i can fully appreciate it in its whimsical, effervescent, chaotic entirety.

fearless was an album full of magic and curiosity, the bliss and devastation of youth. it was the diaRy of the adventures and explorations of a teenage girl who was learning tiny lessons with every new crack in the facade of the faIrytale ending she'd been shown in the movies. i'm thrilled to tell you that my new version of fearless is done and will be with you soon it's called fearless (taylor's version) and it includes 26 songs.

i've spoken a lot about why i'm remaking my first six albums, but the way i've chosen to do this will hopefuLy help illuminate where i'm coming from. artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really *knows* that body of work. for example, only i know which songs i wrote that almost made the fearless album. songs i absolutely adored, but were held back for different reasons (don't want too many breakup songs, don't want too maNy down tempo songs, can't fit that many songs on a physical cd).

those reasons seem unnecessary now. i've decIded i want you to have the whole story, see the entire vivid picture and let you into the entire dreamscape that is my fearless album. that's why i've chosen to include 6 never before released songs on my version of this album. written when i was betweeN the ages 16 and 18, these were the ones it killed me to leave behind.

this process has been more fulfilling and emoTional than i could've imagined and has made me even more determined to re-recorded all of my music. i Hope you'll like this first outing as much as i liked traveling back in time to recreate it.
love story (taylor's version) will be out tonight.

sincerely and fearlessly,
taylor

[Verse 1]
Taxis lights pull out of sight
Around the lane and into the night
Goodbye, this time may be the last

[Verse 2]
Evening song didn't last long
Dreamed I was right, sussed I was wrong
So I make my way through an empty day

[Chorus]
Might have to cry (Might have to cry)
Might have to lie (Might have to lie)
Might have to die (Might have to die a little, this time)

[Verse 3]
Never believed she would leave
I forgot about last time
When she walked out this morning
I went out of my mind
I'll try to smile
Pretend it nevеr happened
Leavе 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
I'll try to fight down to the last

[Chorus]
Might have to cry (Might have to cry)
Might have to lie (Might have to lie)
Might have to die (Might have to die a little, this time)

[Verse 4]
Some people live and learn
Never was lucky that way
Wanted so hard to believe her
But other rains will come
And wash it all away
Other loves will come and go
You must believe me when I say
Didn't want it that way
I'll try to smile
Pretend it never happened
Leave 'em slow but leave 'em laughing
Goodbye, this time may be the last

[Chorus]
Might have to cry (Might have to cry)
Might have to lie (Might have to lie)
Might have to die (Might have to die a little)

Might have to cry (Might have to cry)
Might have to lie (Might have to lie)
Might have to die (Might have to die a little)

[Outro]
Did you ever have to lie
Did you ever have to die a little
Whoa whoa did you ever have to cry
You know you have to lie
You know you gotta die just a little... a little
You know you have to die whoa you gotta cry
Whoa you gotta die

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlor of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter"
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

[Outro: Kevin Abstract & JOBA]
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what? Y-yo

[Verse: Merlyn Wood]
Flash, camera flash, I was baptized
Never, feline, livin' nine lives
Light, my inner light, it was multiplied
By the holy fire of the campfire
When the story really real, then it hit harder
Make a mess, step back, in my head, I'm Harden
Dropped out of college, Momma found a way to stop me
Played guitar 'cause I was six strings away from startin'
It's a drought, I don't even think about the rain
When you play, man, I couldn't feel my love again
It's too late for you to ever hold me close again
Man, my reality just stayed the same

[Chorus: Jabari Manwa]
If I gave you my heart, then would you go away? (Go away)
If you love me then tell me, why would you run away? (Run away)
It's so cold man, and you know it (Know it)
Give up my house and home for you, there ain't no way
If I gave you my all, would I be wrong, mane? (Wrong)
I played the wrong game, put out the wrong frame

[?] longer than the sun is
And yet you know it, but you ain't moving, yo, it ain't no way

[Verse 1]
Hip-hoppin' is the thing that's in
It's where the stone-cold nitro parties begin
So listen party people with the ear to the street
The college professors and the social elite
To the fly young guys and the pretty girls
Ice-T is gonna tell you 'bout the hip-hop world

[Verse 2]
Hip-hoppin' is a way of life
With graffiti and rappin' on the mic
As the records scratch to the break of beat
A-hip-hop is sounds of the street
Hip-hop has been around a while
With the serious funk, the disco style
A record scratch, a simple rap
A breakеr spinnin' on his back
Hip-hop's where it's at

[Verse 3]
Now I'mma break it down for all of you
Who'vе never seen a hip-hop crew
The gangster cuts of cold DJs
Shockin' and rockin' 'til the break of day
Or the master arts of the graffiti man
Expressin' himself with his spray can
Yo people, what's it gonna be?
Hip-hop is makin' history

[Verse 4]
Now a hip-hop club is not a disco
It's a record-cuttin', cold-crushin' rappin' show
Like New York's Roxy, L.A.'s Radio
The DJs keep you at a peak and on the go
No three-piece suits allowed inside
T-shirts, tennis shoes, loosely tied
You hear scratchin' turntables across the floor
And DJs spin on two and sometimes four
Like this...
And you don't quit, like that
Hip-hop's where it's at

[Verse 5]
So when you listen to the music by your radio DJ
And listen to the rappers on the records that they play
And check out the graffiti that turns ghettos into art
Or watch the kids who dance on the street and in the park
We hope it's time you realize hip-hoppin' is the way
To find true peace in city streets in this cold world today
Let's dance, not fight, and all unite, just turn the box up loud
To the funky beat, on any street you'll find that hip-hop crowd

[Verse 6]
'Cause i'm 

[?] MC, my name's Ice-T
When the doctor spanked my butt it was on the beat
Blessed by the DJs up above
I got two deliveries 

[?]

[?] every day
Rap in my bottle when they took my mic away
I rap in my wagon, my bike, my 

[?]

[?] on any sucker that I didn't like
When i rap on the mic and get on the beat
Girls jump in front of cars rolling down the street

[?] once or twice, as a sacrifice
To the love of the player who's cold as ice
When i die, y'all, I wanna be
Pressed into a twelve-inch thirty-three
And given to a DJ who can't be lazy
Scratching cuts 'til the freaks go crazy
Every night when I lay down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If i should die before I wake
Please send me where they scratch and break
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I was not there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
Made my way back home
I searched for form and land
Years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely star
Of all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long, long time ago
Who knows, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world, yeah

(extended live instrumentals/guitar solo)

Who knows, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Oh no; not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold ...
The world
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No, I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry

Should I kiss the viper's fang?
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes in death's release
Ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh

I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of homo sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes in death's release
Ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes in death's release
Ah-oh-oh-oh
Ah-oh-oh-oh, oh
(Thank you! Good evening, welcome to the Phoenix ...)
I've been drifting, drifting
Like a ship on the old sea
I've been drifting, drifting

Won't somebody help me?
Won't somebody rescue me?

Poor little greenie
Snuck into the city
Strung out on lasers
And slash back blazers

Ate all your razors
While pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe ...

Talking 'bout Monroe
And walking on snow white
New York's a go-go
And everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Woo-hoo, yeah
The Jean Genie
Lives on his back
The Jean Genie
Loves chimney stacks and he's uh
Outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh

Sits like a man
But he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him
But just for a short while

She'll scratch in the sand
She won't let go of his hand
Says he's a beautician
Sells you nutrition
Keeps all your dead hair for
Making up underwear
Poor little Greenie. ooh, yah

The Jean Genie
Lives on his back
The Jean Genie
Loves chimney stacks and he's uh
Outrageous
He screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie
Let yourself go, oh
So simple-minded
He can't drive his module
He bites on the neon
And sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved
On, loves to be loved

Jean Genie
Jean Genie
Loves chimney stacks
And he's
Outrageous
Screams and he bawls
Jean Genie
Let yourself go-ooh-oh

Jean Genie
Jean Genie
Loves chimney stacks

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Jabari, me paddy

[Pre-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
'Bout 2K, that's a Kit Kat
I make more than your dad
I'm just like a rich Rugrat
Y'all get on my level
She in my mouth like a biscuit
She make the same face a fish at
Bob her head game vicious
Bad bitch want my spinach

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
I said split that ass, Kit Kat
Split that ass, Kit Kat
Damn! You seen that?
(Take one step back and)
Split that ass, Kit Kat
Split that ass, Kit Kat
Can you take directions?
Split that ass like a Kit Kat

[Verse: Dom McLennon]
Change clothes like Pharrell and Jay
Prolly wearing how I feel today
Bootleg Versace platters on the platter
We serving these niggas like B2K
Roll paper planes that go MIA
Bari got visa, he here to stay
I think we deserve to celebrate
Gated community on the way
I play for keeps like I'm D.O.L.L.A Dame
Might go Hoodie Melo, Stevie Caballero
Switch the tempo, shit, I'm still the same

[?]
On stilettos, we are not the same
Vision on a very different plane
I think he watching on a different game
It's a hit every time a nigga swing, god damn!

[Pre-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
'Bout 2K, that's a Kit Kat
I make more than your dad
I'm just like a rich Rugrat
Y'all get on my level
She in my mouth like a biscuit
She make the same face a fish at
Bob her head game vicious
Bad bitch want my spinach

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
I said split that ass, Kit Kat
Split that ass, Kit Kat
Damn! You seen that?
Take one step back and (Bitch!)
Split that ass, Kit Kat
Split that ass, Kit Kat
Can you take directions?
Split that ass like a Kit Kat

[Verse]
Laid back
You're finally confident
Your thoughts fade away (Oh oh oh)
This doesn't happen easily and now you're feelin' like a winner
How many times have you cried while you're thinking it through?
That if you died through the night, what would your parents do?
Looks like you tried to face your demons last week but I know tonight
This time around, this time is the night
You finally met you tonight
You can say you finally met you tonight
You can do it all your own way
Better luck next time

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bring me, bring me, bring me, bring me
Bring me my umbrella
Angels falling from the sky
I know that I can't hide forever
Keep my pockets sticky
Smelling like some mozzarella
Did you forget that I'm that bitch?
'Cause I always remember

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
It’s going down (Going down)
It’s going down (Going down)
It’s going down (Going down)
Go on and bring me my umbrella
It’s going down (Going down)
It’s going down (Going down)
It’s going down (Going down)
Go on and bring me my umbrella (Huh)

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Bitch, excuse me, who the fuck are you?
I’m tellin' South Central, this is how we do
Back that ass up for me, why you being rude?
I ain’t juvenile, but I got young money too
How a nigga roll like this? We was born to lose
Yeah, I might be rowdy, but I ain’t got shit to prove
I’m a old dog, but my tricks brand new
I went through the notebook like we watching Blue's Clues, see
Everything is smooth, catch me on the move
If you want some drama, better watch the fucking news
Sipping Jamba Juice, diamond on the tooth
I'ma let it come to me, I don't need to choose
Watch the way it blooms, I can’t be removed
Why you being dry, nigga? This a fucking cruise

[?], look like a cartoon
Free that boy Bobby, y'all got jobs, I need some too

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bring me, bring me, bring me, bring me
Bring me my umbrella
Angels falling from the sky
I know that I can't hide forever
Keep my pockets sticky
Smelling like some mozzarella
Did you forget that I'm that bitch?
'Cause I always remember

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
It’s going down (Going down) (What?)
It’s going down (Going down)
It’s going down (Going down) (What?)
Go on and bring me my umbrella
It’s going down (Going down) (What?)
It’s going down (Going down)
It’s going down (Going down) (What?)
Go on and bring me my umbrella

[Verse 2: JOBA]
What’s up (With it?)
What you (Spending?)
Purchase (Pending)
All up on my business
Sucking on kinky binkies
They put the coke in their derrière
We drink milk straight from the titty though
She called me daddy, play truth or dare
Lysergic acid on gummy bears
Sour and sweet like the Chinese chicken
If the booty bouncing, I stop and stare
Like a hippopotamus be peeking
Sweat drip down the crack, call that molly water
Wells from the nip of a baby bottle
Honeysuckles and booty bunches
Gluten-free with the glutes
Houston, we have a problem

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Well I already told you, know I'm bout to light it up (Light it up)
Voodoo chicken wings, what’s that, Louisiana Rub? (Hah)
Cut the beat, I’m tryna hear myself acapella (Shh)
Only 

[?] I get if the sheets are Margiela
Margiela don't even make sheets, but I'll sell ya (I'll sell ya)
If you love gossip, zip the lips and don’t tell us (Boy, shut up)
I don’t trust a man who eat Cinnamon Toast, I love Kellogg’s (I do)
In a black Jeep, just hit a deer, that’s dinner (Mmm)
Shit paid for, I got paperwork, ain't no renter
I’m the number one, you the other one, like them pencils (Like them pencils)
And I got plans, if the bitch smell like garlic, I'm a vampire (Vampire)
If I smell like it too, then we do it
Suck on that, feel like it's pasta
Off of that 

[?]
We driving extra kilometers
Where in the world like Carmen
If you looking for 

[?], show me
If you ball on a budget, I got it, five star Top Ramen (Huh)
Nissan and Impala (Yeah), drove one 'til I'm stallin' (Drove it)
She always want to play these games
Tell that lil’ bitch you ain’t soft (Wanna love me like 

[?])

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bring me, bring me, bring me, bring me
Bring me my umbrella
Angels falling from the sky
I know that I can't hide forever
Keep my pockets sticky
Smelling like some mozzarella
Did you forget that I'm that bitch?
'Cause I always remember

It's going--
Annie doesn't know me that well
But she knows me, better than they do

I could never write a song for jo
See the look on her face is gonna change

And i knew she'd move on by the spring
When the look on her face began to change

She could never tell the truth
Because of what they would do

Oh annie doesn't know me that well
But she knows me better than thеy do
Lyrics from Snippet

Do you not realize that it hurts me
When I see you go out, uh
'Cause you have the time of your life
Only when I’m not around
You know you really don't deserve me

[Intro]
Rio (Rio)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Every night I saw it, skeletons in my closet
Still got all these problems, I thought money would solve 'em
Blood all on the walls and tears drop down, they fallin'
I don't even wanna think about all that, but it's like I can't help it
You say you can't help me, I gotta help myself but
I need help with that 'cause I feel so helpless
I feel like I've been to Hell and back by myself and
There ain't nothin' in the way no more, only myself is

[Bridge: The Kid LAROI]
I'm in the way, I'm in the way of myself
I'm in the way, I'm in the way, I need help
Need it today, I wish I could kill this pain
I wish I could kill this pain, I wish I could kill these days

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day

[Verse 2: Riese Kendrick]
And I said please don't play with my heart and throw it away
I'm not the one who be playing these games
I'm not the one who be running in place
Running in places, I don't 

[?] wasteland
Running in places, I know the one who be playing
I'm not the one who be playing, you playing these games that you know I want
I got the remedy, life is a drug and you know I'm addicted to you
Yeah, I'm addicted to you, why you a thief for the love?
I'm getting everything, I got a wedding ring, I got it ready for us
Yeah, I wish there was a way that you could understand me
I wish there was a way that you could understand me (Rio)
I wish there was a way that you could understand me
I wish, I wish, I wish, yeah

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day

My body wants ya don't ya know

It's runnin' up around my leg
I can't stop this feeling I got

You know I can't sleep at night
I can't stop, though I love you a lot
I never want you out of my sight
I can't stop this feeling I got
I got it shaking all in my shoes
I can't stop this feeling I got
The doctor say there's nothing that he can do

[Chorus]
I can't stop (can't stop)

[Spoken Outro]
That don't work
Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah
Ow!

[Verse 1]
How'd it ever get so wrong?
Crying in the stall of a washroom floor (Yeah)
You niggas don't know where I'm from
Don't know how I got here, but I'm all alone
And I've been wakin' up feeling as lonely as I was before, but
No, I cannot stick around for long
Tell my mom, 'cause I know she wants me home now (Home now)

[Chorus]
I'm just a shame
I'm just a waste (Uh-uh)
It's the way it is
'Cause my mama said

[Verse 2]
Swear you're never gonna see me fall
Take it how I get it then I ask for more
A different town is all I'm asking for
Pack up all my things and hurry out the door
I never asked to be driven away in a foreign car (Ow)
'Cause the bus will take me just as long
And now I gotta sleep with the lights still on now

[Bridge]
I know you're tired of me doing the same
I know you're tired of me running away
I don't think you'll ever really see me the same
Life ain't so bad at all
Now I need a lot of-

[Chorus]
I'm just a shame
I'm just a waste
It's the way it is
'Cause my mama said

[Outro]
I'm just a shame
I'm just a waste (Uh-uh)
It's the way it is
'Cause my mama said
I'm just a shame
How'd it ever get so wrong? (Ha!)
Crying in the stall of a washroom floor (I'm just a waste)
(It's the way it is)
You niggas don't know where I'm from ('Cause my mama said)
Don't know how I got here, but I'm all alone
I'm just a shame (How'd it ever get so wrong?)
I'm just a waste (Crying in the stall of a washroom floor)
It's the way it is
'Cause my mama said
I know you're tired of me doing the same
I know you're tired of me running away

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody evеr showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should bе grievin' this way

[Verse]
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
And I told her, out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way


You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

[Insturmental Break]
Aaow!

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a man is out tonight

You should have told her

Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! (Hoo!)

[Intro]
I want it to be, like, messy

[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)

[Outro]
Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Verse 2]
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

[Pre-Chorus]
And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah)
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor
(Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you're still a traitor

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

[Verse 1]
I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

[Verse 2]
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

[Bridge]
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

[Outro]
Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay

[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff

[Chorus]
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse 2]
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

[Bridge]
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Intro]
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Break]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Outro]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

[Verse 1]
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

[Verse 2]
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

[Chorus]
You found someonе more exciting
The nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

[Verse 3]
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

[Chorus]
Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

[Bridge]
And don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying

[Outro]
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you
Enough for you, oh
No, nothing's enough for you

[Verse 1]
I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

[Chorus]
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)

[Verse 2]
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all

[Chorus]
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)

[Bridge]
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

[Chorus]
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me

[Verse 1]
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

[Chorus]
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Verse 2]
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Bridge]
It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became

[Chorus]
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

[Outro]
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause, baby, you were mine

[Chorus]
You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

[Verse 1]
While you still have the time you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind
Is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whisky bars
No one cares who you really are

[Verse 2]
You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard
Keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be
A part of the arrangement

[Chorus]
You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

[Outro]
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been more

[Verse 1]
It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With you father's gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be

[Verse 2]
I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be

[Verse 3]
You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gavе up all the golden factories
To see, who in thе world you might be

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Who let the dope boys out?
Thank God you let me crash on your couch
Who's my God that I'm prayin' to now?
Early two-thous, they tried to jump me in, Latino protection
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
Texan, I text him, I told him I got him
Told him I made it to Hollywood, all it took was a summer to fail
A platinum record not gon' keep my Black ass out of jail
Truth prevails, this is real, miss my brother
I love my mother, drove all the way to Cali' just to check up on me
Made her go home, felt the virus
Web of life is my weave, false dreams stripped by silence
Deals thеy had us sign; for years, it had me blind
Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shinе
Got my cousin doin' time, he was barely pushin' dimes
My whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Now, get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I (Get the fuck out)
Fuck with me, give no shit, guess my ignorance is bliss
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
So get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
If a killer say shit, then get these motherfuckers— (Get the fuck out)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
See, I ain't arrogant, I promise I just know my worth
Sometimes you gotta be the one that ends up shootin' first
Your fate could get decided as soon as you do your dirt
It's demons on the corner tryna pull you from the Earth
Them fangs and nails are really daggers the more you observe
Them games and tales don't really matter when you feeling cursed
Can't satiate your needs if you ain't sure what you deserve
I'm just a free slave running from the universe
Choose your worst, y'all don't know how the future work
Survival-horror, science-fiction, what gets you concerned
I navigate the copaganda tryna screw my nerves
My style references a standard that leaves you disturbed
Second-generation, reincarnate of Lucifer
Opp executioner, real nigga troubadour
Smoking petrol, growin' several, orbiting Jupiter
Should I put you on or you want me to make a move at ya?

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
Goddamn motherfucker, oh
I- I float (Go)
Well, I'ma see ya when I see you
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
(Yeah, nigga, we back up in this thang)
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide
(Yeah, new machine)
They said I'd never, ever see the sunlight (So tell 'em, woo, tell 'em)
I thought I'd never, ever see the sunlight (So tell 'em)
They said I'd never, ever see the sunlight

[Outro: Joba, Kevin Abstract, & Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes, it drives me crazy (Look at the sky!)
This all I got for you (Niggas!)
That sunlight, it'll drive you crazy
What is God to you niggas?
(Goddamn, motherfucker, ugh)

[Verse 1]
Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar"
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

[Verse 2]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
"Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
"Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

[Chorus]
Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 1]
Sisotowbell Lane
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbours come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue

[Verse 2]
Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view

[Verse 3]
Sisotowbell Lane
Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade through the grain
You always do
Yes we always do
Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car
We always do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you

[Verse 1]
I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

[Verse 2]
Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I'll play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good for free

[Verse 3]
Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on their TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

[Verse 1]
I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Through the buyers and the sellers
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows

[Verse 2]
The cars and buses bustled thru the bedlam of the day
I looked through window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated through chrome-plate
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon
Through the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows

[Verse 3]
He asked me for a dollar more
He cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride
And share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb
And stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand
Another hand reached out for more
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades

[Outro]
You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows
You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows

[Verse 1]
I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting-

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

[Verse 2]
I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Latеly he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He livеs in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

[Verse 3]
I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

[Verse 1]
Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns
That run down the drain
In colored arrangements
That Michael will change with a stick that he found

[Chorus]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

[Verse 2]
Michael brings you to a park
He sings and its dark when the clouds come by
Yellow slickers up on swings
Like puppets on strings hanging in the sky
They'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchens
Their mothers will scold
But Michael will hold you
To keep away cold till the sidewalks are dry-

[Chorus]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

[Chorus]
Michael leads you up the stairs
He needs you to care and you know you do
Cats come crying to the key
And dry you will be in a towel or two
There's rain in the window
There's sun in the painting that smiles on the wall
You want to know all
But his mountains have called so you never do-

[Outro]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well
Someday I will know you very well

[Verse 1]
Light up light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Takin' the town by surprise
Night time night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from and places to go

[Chorus]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

[Verse 2]
Take off take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

[Chorus 2]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time

[Verse 1]
Marcie in a coat of flowers
Steps inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye

[Verse 2]
Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidеwalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from thе river there's no one to take her
To the sea

[Verse 3]
Marcie dresses warm its snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how
He tells her
Wait for me

[Outro]
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again

[Verse 1]
Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbour wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his seadreams come to me

[Verse 2]
City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his seadreams come to me

[Verse 3]
Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his seadreams come to me
All his seadreams come to me

[Verse 1]
The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port I wonder
To see a lady so my friends say
She dances for the sailors
In a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbour town
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss
He'll steal your heart and sail away
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam
Of a broken promise in the bay
Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus
He came again to see her
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday
Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us
I was at sea then

[Verse 2]
I didn't see them
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last
The one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace
Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go"
And he would hold me close
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace
All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow
I was at sea I tell you I was
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place
Searching for sails that don't come
And I guess but I don't know

[Outro]
Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't know

[Verse 1]
Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

[Verse 2]
I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

[Verse 3]
Out of thе city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shouldеrs
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach
Out of cry

[Verse 4]
I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach
Out of cry

[Verse 1]
There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

[Verse 2]
There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles
He calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free

[Verse 3]
There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes "Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try"
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory
And she's so busy being free

[Verse 4]
There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity
And she's so busy being free

[Verse 5]
There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free

[Outro]
Like a cactus tree
Being free

[Verse 1]
He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafes
And I only say, "Hello"
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring
To wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

[Verse 2]
Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second hand
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they'rе found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know shе keeps him down
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrows endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her?

[Outro]
He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
He knows that's what he'll find

[Verse 1]
Trina wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with lines
Sewing lace on widows weeds
And filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leave are filigree
And her coat's a second hand one
Trimmed with antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon

[Verse 2]
Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying "you are welcome back"
She is another canyon lady

[Verse 3]
Estrella, circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At bevelled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and bevelled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon

[Verse 4]
Trina takes her pins and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon

[Verse 1]
Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again
Like I gave my heart too soon
He stood looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why
I love him

[Verse 2]
Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell
When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are so many reasons why I love him
Willy is my child, he is my father

[Verse 1]
Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories
Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback
Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

[Verse 2]
Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun
Still I'll take a chance and see
I found somеone to love today

[Verse 3]
Therе's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him
In a Bleecker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today

[Verse 1]
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

[Bridge]
Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And thе streets are paved with passersby
And pigеons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

[Verse 3]
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

[Outro]
When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

[Verse 1]
Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

[Verse 2]
Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

[Verse 3]
Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll takе what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know wherе I stand

[Verse 1]
I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playin' on the horses; you were playin' on the guitar strings;
You were playin' like a devil wearin' wings
Wearin' wings, you looked so grand wearin' wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing?
Can you fly? I heard you can, can you fly?
Like an eagle doin' your huntin' from the sky

[Verse 2]
I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover; you were shaking up the dice;
And I thought I saw you cheatin' once or twice
Once or twice, I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wond'rin' was the gamble worth the price?
Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?

[Verse 3]
So lately you've been hidin', it was somewhere in the news;
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues;
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine;
And I feel like I've been workin' overtime
Over time, I've lost my fire, over time

[Verse 4]
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down, I'm gettin' tired, slowin' down;
And I envy you the valley that you've found
Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down
Down, down, down

[Verse 1]
I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

[Verse 2]
She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

[Verse 3]
Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

[Verse 4]
When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

[Verse 5]
In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

[Verse 6]
You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

[Verse 7]
I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me
You studied to portray me
In ice and greens
And old blue jeans
And naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes
That all your work discloses

[Chorus 1]
"Lady, don't love me now I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you"

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in a magazine
I found a page about you
I see that now it's Josephine
Who cannot be without you
I keep your housе in fit repair
I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes hеre from everywhere
The writing looks like ladies'

[Chorus 2]
"Lady, please love me now, I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you"

[Verse 3]
I gave you all my pretty years
Then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here
While you went west for pleasure
And now you're flying back this way
Like some lost homing pigeon
They've monitored your brain, you say
And changed you with religion

[Chorus 3]
"Lady, please love me now I was dead
I am no saint, turn down your bed
Lady, have you no heart," that's what you said
Well, I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you

[Outro]
When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me
And all their eyes look shady

[Verse 1]
Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behind
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty
The shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blind
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me

[Chorus]
I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

[Verse 2]
Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but nevеr disregarding her

[Chorus]
Oh, I think I understand
Fеar is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

[Verse 3]
Sometime voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time

[Chorus]
Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

[Verse 1]
Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen

[Chorus]
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

[Verse 2]
People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies

[Chorus]
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

[Verse 3]
Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening

[Chorus]
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

[Verse 4]
Doеs the moon play only silver
When it strums thе galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

[Outro]
Songs to aging children came
This is one

[Intro]
And so once again
My dear Johnny my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

[Verse 1]
You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh, my friend
What time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist

[Verse 2]
And so oncе again
Oh, America my friend
And so once again
You arе fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

[Outro]
You say we have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you please
Can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend
We have all come
To fear the beating of your drum

[Verse 1]
Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

[Chorus]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all

[Verse 1]
When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milk trucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown
We'll rise up early, with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Verse 2]
We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown
Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning in any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Verse 3]
I'd like to buy you еverything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colorеd rings
In morning Morgantown
But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same
Morning's just the same

[Verse 1]
The priest sat in the airport bar
He was wearing his father's tie
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far
Whenever the words ran dry
Behind the lash and the circles blue
He looked as only a priest can: through
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you
And my eyes said, "Let us try"

[Verse 2]
He said, "You wouldn't like it here
No, it's no place you should share
The roof is ripped with hurricanes
And the room is always bare
I need the wind and I seek the cold"
He reached past the wine for my hand to hold
And he saw me young, and he saw me old
And he saw me sitting there

[Verse 3]
Then he took his contradictions out
And he splashed them on my brow
So which words was I then to doubt
When choosing what to vow
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines
And he asked for truth and he asked for time
And he asked for only now
Now the trials are trumpet scored
Oh will we pass the test
Or just as one loves more and more
Will one love less and less
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin
Saying let them lose, crying let them win
Oh make them both confess

[Verse 1]
Lady called the blue boy, love
She took him home
Made himself an idol, yes
So he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she travelled
To place her flowers
Before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love
To waken in his face
In his face, oh

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in the evening
He would read to her
Roll her in his arms
And give his seed to her
She would wake in thе morning
Without him
And go to the window
And look out through the pane
But thе statue in her garden
He always looked the same
He looked the same, ah

[Verse 3]
Bring her boots of leather
And she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan
She'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight
To find her again
He will come few times more
Till he finds a lady statue
Standing in a door
In her door

[Verse 1]
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 4]
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

[Verse 1]
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me

I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Verse 2]
Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

[Chorus]
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

[Bridge]
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

[Chorus]
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
(To some semblance of a garden.)

[Verse 1]
Yesterday a child came out to wander
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

[Chorus]
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

[Verse 2]
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated ovеr ten clear frozen strеams
Words like "when you're older" must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

[Chorus]
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

[Verse 3]
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

[Chorus]
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

[Verse 4]
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

[Chorus]
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

[Verse 1]
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh, I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh, I love you when I forget about me
I want to be strong, I want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you want to dance with me, baby?
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me, baby?
Well, come on

[Verse 2]
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses, my mind see-saws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me, baby?
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

[Verse 3]
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh, the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun
Want to be the one that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater
Want to write you a love letter
I want to make you feel better
I want to make you feel free
Want to make you feel free
I want to make you feel free

[Verse 1]
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

[Verse 2]
He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay, baby

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

[Bridge]
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

[Verse 3]
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man
Keeping away my blues

[Bridge]
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

[Verse 4]
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues

[Verse 1]
Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children who've made her
Little green, be a gypsy dancer

[Verse 2]
He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter and say "Her eyes are blue"
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little green, hе's a non-conformer

[Chorus]
Just a little green
Like thе color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

[Verse 3]
Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed
Little green, have a happy ending

[Chorus]
Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

[Verse 1]
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And my fancy French cologne

[Chorus]
Oh, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine

[Verse 2]
Come on down to the Mermaid Café and I will
Buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

[Chorus]
Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

[Chorus]
Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy
But I like you

[Verse 4]
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

[Chorus]
Oh, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But you're out of sight

[Verse 1]
Blue
Songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

[Verse 2]
Hey, blue
There is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

[Bridge]
Well, there's so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs
Lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you

[Verse 3]
Blue, there is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
Thеre is your song from me

[Verse 1]
Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

[Chorus]
Oh, but California
California, I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California, I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh, the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there

[Chorus]
But my heart cried out for you, California
Oh, California, I'm coming home
Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

[Bridge]
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues

[Verse 3]
So I bought me a ticket
I got on a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, "How long can you hang around?"
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown

[Chorus]
Then I'm going home to California
California, I'm coming home
Oh, will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

[Chorus]
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh, will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Will you?
Will you take me as I am?
Hmmm mmmmm
Take me as I am

[Verse 1]
Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there, that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors

[Chorus]
Oh, starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

[Verse 2]
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you, baby, I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up there's thе heavens
Down therе's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
Come on, light the candle in this poor heart of mine

[Chorus]
Oh, starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

[Verse 3]
I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing "Goodbye, baby
Baby, goodbye
Ooh ooh, love is blind"
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on, baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again, baby

[Chorus]
Starbright, starbright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
Shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 2]
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

[Verse 3]
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 4]
I'm so hard to handle
I'm sеlfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the bеst baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

[Verse 5]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 1]
The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me, "All romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
"You laugh," he said, "you think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies?
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies"

[Verse 2]
He put a quartеr in the Wurlitzer
And he pushеd three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said "Drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close."
"Richard, you haven't really changed," I said, it's just that
Now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreamy
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

[Verse 3]
Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way someday
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafés
Dark cafés, only a dark cocoon
Before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase, these dark café days

I know you're going home to your lady, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
Baby got mystery and I got history
Don't get too into me, you could get in too deep
Head past the settle down, knock 'til you're out of town
I just wan' f*** right now, scared it might get around
I like what I like, you like what you do
You see my eyes, boy, I just can't keep 'em off you
Turnin' me on, I-I just can't see through you
God bless your girl 'cause this feeling, it is voodoo

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
I know you're going home to your lady, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat & Eve]
Mm, tonight
Mm-mm, tonight
Oh, mm, tonight (Haha, yo)
Oh, mm-mm, tonight

[Verse 2: Eve]
Ayo, had a dream about you knockin' on my door
And then we end up kickin' it with you up in my arms
Every time she ringin', you not answering the phone
Said you'd bе a minute and still ain't made it home, uh
Lеt's get it on tonight
Blame it on the liquor, we 'on't know what's wrong from right
Meltin' on me, ice cream, baby, slip and slide
Are you changin' your clothes or are you changin' your mind?
'Cause we both know there's only one place you'll be goin'
Baby, down at the garden, have you eatin' them greens
Got you speakin' in tongues, mi amor, E-V-E
Long as you ready to drive, limousine, Doja Cat

[Chorus: Doja Cat & Eve]
I know you're going home to your lady, tonight (Yeah)
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy, tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Shit I mean feel so sick (Sick), I ain't talking sickle cell
Everything I drop is cold, aye, tell me how I give them hell, uh

This ain't regular degular
This ain't a regular day

This ain't regular paper
Never had a regular job
Never had a regular car
Never had a regular cock
And I ain't a regular star
Never got a regular start
Y'all blowing up overnight
They ain't gonna remember tomorrow
I ain't got a regular shake
Booty don't match my weight
Baby gonna snatch my lacefront

[?] grace
I'm too outta this world
Probably going back into space

This ain't regular dick

This is my bacon, my oink
That's your bitch on my groin
Y'all ain't getting my coin
This ain't a regular day

[Verse]
Fuck all the mosquitos on the planet
They can eat a whole dick
I don't fuck with mosquitos
What the fuck am i saying
I'm just tryna fucking eat some motherfuckin lunch
Cuz' i didn't eat nothing today
I'm just tryna eat some snacks, yuh!
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside, I knew it was real
Baby boy, I knew it was real
Telling you I knew it was real, yeah
The way you make me feel
For real, for real
I'm serious
Can you still call?
Can you come back?
Can you make sure that I still laugh?
That I don't do all that dumb shit
Just to feel

[Verse 1]
Every day I'm in a daze
Looking for that someone
And every day I sit and kneel and pray
Oh, sweet love, can I get some?

[Chorus]
So why do you dessert me, baby boy?
I need your love right now, oh
And if you dessert me, baby boy
Don't you leave me in your crowd
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Hey, baby, what time are you gonna get home?
Oh really? Alright, well I'll see you later then
Oh, wait, would you mind getting some, um...
Yeah, when you come home
Yeah, that's it
I love you too
Bye

[Verse 2]
Someday when you see my face
You will think that you have won
And someday when it's all away
I'll have just begun

[Chorus]
So why did you dessert me, baby boy?
I thought that you, you were the one
So if you preferred the other one
She won't bring you the Sun
Cold like the day
Feel your heart slip away
But it belongs to me
Only me, only me
Not even you (Girl)

We're not the same
I'm like air you're a flame
So why can't you just
Keep it together
Your mood like the weather
Go

Called you today
Felt your face hit the table
I can hear your voice
As it changes
You dread these exchanges

You're up and down
You're checked out
Or out of town
It doesn't even matter
Don't know why
I give up and goodnight
Out in the garden
I see something dark and it's coming
Yea right for me

Are you her or are you a creature from a planet far
If you push me to the edge would I slip or would I fall
In the city or on a farm you won't find what you want
Please go back to where you're from and leave me by myself
Sometimes I wish I was a seed living in the dirt
When I take for granted what I love my stomach turns it
Turns it, turns it, turns it, turns it, turns it, turns it, turns it, turns it

Take me back
Back to where this started
Holy land
Find a way back down to the seeds

Sometimes I wake up and light my candles
Breathe in deep
When I leave my body, I look down and see my feet
What's beneath
What's beneath
What's beneath
What's beneath
What's beneath
What's beneath
What's beneath
What's beneath
Take me back to the
Place it startеd
Holy land
There's no way back therе
Gone too far
Gone too far
Gone too far
Gone too far
Athena looks at me
I feel so dizzy
I grab all my things and I
Head for the city, I
Don't have a clue what it means to be in you
I don't have a clue about this world

Say my goodbye
But my head's halfway gone
There's a giant antenna
It stretches back home
When I hear something new
I grab onto her close
Let me forget feeling so alone

Where have I gone?
I've been gone so long
Where have I gone?
I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long
I've been gone

[Verse 1]
Ma rolls in the waves
She wants someone to save her
Says she used to be a beauty
Then they took her soul
So far away from here (Gone)

[Verse 2]
Counting down the days 'til
All her hairs turn gray
I know that nobody’s to blame, but
How'd she become so insane?
We'll never know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lead the way, she’ll sedate
Tell you when her body aches
How the waves oscillate
Tells me how her body achеs

[Verse 4]
She can't hear it, so how can I
Help hеr find a way?
Sun is falling, dark waves crawl in
All the birds sing out
Such a familiar sound

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Counting down the days
Counting down the days
Counting down the days
Counting down the days

[Outro]
How'd she become—
Leaving
Run far away
Be well
You'll find yourself

Retreat
Losing your speed
Return
To the place you were born

Go long
Go for the gold
Breathe in
Breathe out the smoke
Retreat
Don't miss a beat
Return
To the place you were born
Seems all my life
I lick your wounds
Does it feel nice?
Mumble and groan
It fills the silence
In your throat

Will you come with me
So I can see infinity?
Will you come with me
So I can be infinity?

Stuck on a path
Our hips conjoin so
We can't look back

Mumble and moan
It fills the silence
In my throat

You step over the curb into a gutter
Fall in a tunnel underwater
Crosses my mind, hope you recover
All that you had
But nobody can hear you
Unless you let them in
Yea nobody can hear you
Unless you let them in
You press on my temples deep
You said I whimper in my sleep
In my head there is a street
Walk on down it feels so sweet
And I sleep to let it be
And I sleep so I can breathe

Plastic bunnies metal trees
Let's make them burn before I leave
Pour the ice melt watch it steam
Is it like magic or a dream?
It all drips down into the sea
It disappears like one, two, three
This is a song about Tibet; on the "Earthling" album ...
Thank you, you too! This is called "Seven Years in Tibet"

Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone

Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
I feel nothing at all

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
Nothing

Oh the reaper man
We’ve got a lot of love to give
Better come on if you can

Here comes a women
Wrapped up in chain
You pull that

When your life in pain
If you rather be free
Come along with me
And leave a hard-hitting man
He'll never understand
I said, uh "Bring yourself first"
And spend ya time 

[?]
Work hard in your mind
Only if you come alive
Baby, prove to the land
You understand
Your eyes are gone

[Interlude]
Hey
Come on, baby
Come on with me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Everybody, live a life, live a life
Everybody, love a lot
Everybody, hear it

Of, of love

Mmm num ba de

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da, that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Eе do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
Pеople on streets

People on streets

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow takes me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn

Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love

Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

Hi. I'm not home right now
But if you'd like to leave a message
Just start talking at the sound of the tone
Ah, ah
Ha- ha- ha -ha- ha
Hello? This is your Mother. Are you there?
Are you coming home?
Ha- ha- ha -ha- ha
Hello? Is anybody home?
You don't know me
But I know you
And I've got a message
To give to you
Here come the planes

[Instrumental band & synth bridge]

So you better get ready
Ready to go
You can come as you are
Pay as you go
Pay as you go

Ah ah ah ah ah
And I said: OK. Who is this really?
And the voice said:
This is the hand, the hand that takes
This is the hand, the hand that takes
This is the hand, the hand that takes
Here come the planes
They're American planes. Made in America
Smoking or non-smoking?
Ah, ah
Ah ah ah ah
And the voice said: Neither snow nor rain nor gloom of night
Shall stay these couriers from the swift completion
Of their appointed rounds

[Bridge]
'Cause when love is gone, there's always justice
And when justice is gone, there's always force
And when force is gone, there's always Mom. Hi Mom!
Ah, ah
Ah ah ah ah

So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
In your automatic arms. Your electronic arms
In your arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
Your petrochemical arms. Your military arms
In your electronic arms
Now just stay ... just for a minute or two
Stay: just for a minute or two?  Damn

Damn!
Damn

This week came past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me

I know there's a change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
Oh if you would stay here tonight, ooh
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad
This time
'Cause you can nevеr really tell
When somеbody wants something
You want, too ...
Damn!
Heart breaker, heart wrecker
Save me tonight
Life can be vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay -
That's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too ...

Stay!
Come on stay
Stay!
Stay!

Stay why don't you, oh oh oh oh
Stay why don't you
Good night
She had an horror of rooms
She was tired, you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes
They were blue but nobody home
Well, she could've been a killer
If she didn't walk the way she do
And she do
She opened strange doors
That we'd never close again

She began to wail
Jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights
Know what I mean

Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters
Supеr creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She askеd me to stay
And I stole her room
She asked for my love
And I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
And she can't socialize
Well, I love the little girl
And I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails Jimmy's guitar sound
Jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights
Know what I mean

Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters
Super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Bye-bye Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette
So stationary
You're released but your custody calls

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I just bake up
Every single day they get my cake up
When I wake up, I just bake up
Head to the barber to get a shape-up
When I wake up, I just bake up
Every single day they get my cake up
When I wake up, I just bake up
Head to the barber to get a shape-up (Yeah)

[Verse]
Smoke an indo, gotta keep my brim low
Car fillin' with smoke, rollin' up the windows
Find a chick to give me neck like a lymph node
In the south now, ridin' in the six-four
Yeah, six-four like Nintendo
I keep it real, you got that fake-ass pretend flow
This my job, no hourly wage
Just a lifetime supply of the sour and haze
They try and tell me that I should probably stay in school
Play it cool, but I tend to just break the rules
On my way to college, nah, bitch, April Fool's
Yeah, I'm comin', better make some room

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I just bake up
Every single day they get my cake up
When I wake up, I just bake up
Head to the barber to get a shape-up
When I wake up, I just bake up
Every single day they get my cake up
When I wake up, I just bake up
Head to the barber to get a shape-up

What it feels like in this world?
What it feels like?
For a girl, for a girl, for a girl
For a girl, for a girl, for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no onе knows
When you're trying hard to be your bеst
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]

[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like
What it feels like
For a girl?
What it feels like
For a girl?

[Verse 1]
Whoever told you
I don't care about you
Is that a friend
You should keep around you?
I tried my best
To remove all the doubts now
Our business
Is open for discussion

[Chorus]
They think you can do better
All alone
A couple strangers acting clever
Oh no
They come and go it’s temperamental
I told you so I only care about forever
I wish you the best in all your future endeavours
Let's see where this goes and find out if we end up better

[Verse 2]
Had me convinced that I knеw you best
And now you're sending paragraphs of words that camе from someone else
Why’d you have to put me to the test?
The pressure leaves the impression you're wanting something else

[Bridge]
(Yeah) And why are all your friends paranoid?
Do they not know how much that we were in love?
Hope you're not stuck with this unfillable void
Gave you my everything and now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus]
Just because they think you can do better
All alone
A couple strangers acting clever
Oh no
They come and go it's temperamental
I told you so I only care about forever
I wish you the best in all your future endeavours
Let's see where this goes and find out if we end up better

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Won't you hear me pop champagne
Why you want to be a headache
Always weighing down my brain
All you ever do is complain, uh
My homie just beat that case
My lawyer had to pop that case
We just take a jet to the base
How you gonna sit and complain

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak, Ariana Grande & Tayla Parx]
Alone and available
And so unobtainable
I know you want me for more
And I'm walking in the light

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
My momma ain't raise no bi-
My daddy smoke Menthol cigs
My brother can't keep a legal gig
But I know he do whatever for the kids
It's gotta be a better way to live
There's gotta be some mеdicine for this
Can't a nigga get a second to brеathe
I need a little space for my sanity, kids

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak, Ariana Grande & Tayla Parx]
Alone and available
And so unobtainable
I know you want me for more
And I'm walking in the light

[Bridge: Ariana Grande, Tayla Parx & Anderson .Paak]
I'm walking in the light
I'm walking in the light
I'm walking in the light
And I'm- (walking in the light)
Wo-wo-won't you hear me pop champagne

Alone and available
And so unobtainable
I know you want me for more
And I'm walking in the light

Both of them bitches done came on my pants
Louis V dripping, lil' niggas
Ain't none of my niggas ain't rocking no Vans
He mad at me 'cause his bitch is a fan
Do what I want, and he do what he can
I put that bitch in the figure-four
Too many vibes, so it's hard to pick a ho
Came from the bottom, I used to be broke
I was trapping, and I used to trap out the liquor store
I bet it all on the tin and foil
Drop off the pack, that's a give and go
Now when I rap on the track, it's a ten or more
I'm in the club with a Glock, it's extended
Tint is so dark, they can't see who is in it
Niggas ain't cashing out, these niggas rented
YSL, we going overboard
Plugged everywhere like extension cord

Pussy right on your nose
This bitch on freaky shit (Freaky)
She know how to squeeze a dick (Nasty)
But after all is said and done (What you do>)
I'm just gon' leave the bitch (See ya)
Headed to the strip club, straight to the DJ booth
And made a quick dub, and I got a dick rub
Bitches on my line, they gon' keep tryin'
But if you wanna shake some ass bitch, I got time
She got slow work, on that pole work
She can stretch that ass, but it don't hurt
Lookin' like an hourglass, treat 'em the same, with no difference
Look at all the ass on them bad bitches

Now you want it, if you want it

You want me to get it, want me to get it

But now you sayin', you sayin' something

[Extended Intro]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Back, before I said goodbye
Just as the first day turned to night
Just as the concrete turned to dust
And the steel turned into rust

All I could think was a new way to dig through the damage
Couldn't think of a way to get through this
Now, I see you taking advantage
And I find another reason to do this

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm digging us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
You're gonna have to follow me under it

Let go, it's begun
Close your eyes, I'm not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Now, that I said goodbye
Just as the darkness turned to light
Just as the next light turns to day
And the world gets underway

All I can see is the anticipation
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops
And I waited patiently, taking it in
Ready for the first of the face-off's

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm digging us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
You're gonna have to follow me under it

Let go, it's begun
Close your eyes, I'm not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(I...) I'm digging us a hole to travel through

(I...) I'm digging us a hole to travel through
(I...) I wanna find a way to rattle you
(You...) You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
(You...) You're gonna have to follow me under it

(I...) I'm digging us a hole to travel through

[Extended Intro]

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this desert, in darkness
Lying with the gun across his chest
Pretending he's heartless
As the fire flashes in the sky

He was fragile and frozen
When the bullet took away his friend
And now he's somehow more broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sweating and shaking
Lying with her hands across her chest
She wakes with her cravings
As the fire flashes in her eye

She was fragile and frozen
When the needle took away her friend
But now she's somehow more broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
With every battle he's chosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind

With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
With every battle he's chosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind

With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

Soon as you walked in it was meant to be
You was in capris and some FILA sneaks
I was in my jeans with my Jesus piece
With my I love Jesus tee and my EBT
Either way I wasn’t stopping
You ever been to Six Flags girl? (No)
Next we on Colossus flossing
You would never really call me Breeze
“That ain’t what your mama named you”
“That ain’t what your mama named you baby”
You my angel flower wings
Said you hate lovе songs
Well it’s odd that you keep singing along (singing along singing along singing along)

Plenty of fishes in the sea
But some odd reason I can’t see myself leaving
Uh-uh that ain’t me
Truth hurts
Sweeter than nougat
Plus you just bought me a new shirt (Ha)
Plus you know I’m a real flirt
But I ain’t humping nobody no
No I ain’t humping nobody no
I ain’t humping nobody but you
So when you get to the crib you know exactly what we gon do
Talk about love
And won’t you slip into something more comfortable

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak & Woman]
Haaa no
New shit
I bet you won’t let me do that shit
Come here
Ha Breezy, (Woah) I’m yours
Woah
Woah
It’s yours
Woah
It’s yours
Woah (Breezy)
That’s mine (I’m yours)
I got her on lock
Hey, let’s work
I got her on lock

[Verse: Chester Bennington]

[...] recieved

[...] they made

[...] I believed

[...] break away

[...] I'm alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Thoughts that take away my pride
Trapped in places deep inside
Memories I've come to fear
And I can't make them disappear

(Thoughts like these return to me)
Thoughts that take away my pride
Trapped in places deep inside
(Memories trapped inside of me)
Memories I've come to fear
And I can't make them disappear

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All these diamonds in my chains got me dancing 'round this bitch
I'm Martin Luther King, black diamonds on my wrist (Run that back, Turbo)
Put Giuseppes on my kids, put Chanel Coco on my bitch
Put that four-four on the switch, then you cock, pop, pop, then dip
I've been in the trenches, the trap, to be specific
I fell in love with my bitches, then sold 'em for some riches
This money be my missus, drive me crazy, I need Ritalin
I told 'em, "I'm so slimy, I'm so shady, I admit it, yeah"

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Slatt like to shoot, slatt like to murk
Twenty-one gun salute (Baow), drilling, putting in work (Yeah)
Cut his tonsils out (Woo), I said it'd hurt (Ayy)
Keep a new four-four, yeah, let it burst
Pockets Honey Kettle, keep on pedal
Get my own cheddar, all my dogs better
Honeycomb bezel, we make opps jitter
Maison Margielas, cases get settled
Here, clean the cookie off, family, Travis, the Scotts
Servin' the bags, I'm cookin' the stove
Came in the spot and we servin' with soap
I was just spazzing, finding the flow
I'm with some Crips, down with some Locs
Hand in the pot, I'm with some Bloods
How many slatts? Leave it to us (Yeah)
Yeah, countin' racks, smokin' on pot
Yeah, I upgraded my thot
Yeah, I upgraded my spots
Yeah, thots chickened out
Woo, yeah, the spots upgraded, now them bitches chickened out
Hey, thirty-five burnt hundreds on my pocket watch

[Chorus: Young Thug, Young Thug & Gunna]
All these diamonds in my chains got me dancing 'round this bitch

And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your fellas say that you lost without me
All my shorties feel like I dodged the county
Cuffin' with you feel like jail, buddy (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, buddy (Exhale)
Cookie like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this cash for real (All this cash)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

[Chorus: Doja Cat, SZA & Both]
Can you kiss me more?

Please don't ask me 'bout no gang affiliation
'Cause when I hop on this mic I put and end to all the hatred

A couple haters say shit but only few can make it
Okay, it's basic, Breezy from the 

[?] Crew
We maintainin', indeed, I can beat you fools
You ain't amazin', now witness the changin'
The metamorphosis from dumb choruses to lush arrangements
Performed by orchestras, training game in my focus

[?] hangin' with Morpheus, he told me how this world wasn't what I hoped it was
So now I'm on some hocus-pocus dust
Jumpin' buildings, punchin' niggas through ceilings
Red or blue pill 

[?] I settled on the real, and
I can give a damn about how you feelin'
It's the shit I can't clear for the kids with open ears
Smokin' dope, hopeless, by the peer, yeah, I feel them
You drunk crackin' jokes with your peers
Well, throw this in your iPod, connect it to your AUX
And travel out 'til your mind's lost in the paradox
And shout out to Orchestrator from the 

[?]

[Interlude]
"Okay, look, kid, you're doing decent for yourself, you know. You got this mixtape, 'Shit, I Can't Clear,' you got "Violets Are Blue" for the ladies, you're doing a lot of shows, but we gotta do some branding, man. You gotta get your name out there."
"LoveJoy, LoveJoy
LoveJoy, LoveJoy, I can hear them scream my name
Let me hear you say"
"Okay. Not bad, not bad, but it's not the harmonies that are gonna make them remember you, Breeze. It's repetition."
"Breezy LoveJoy, Breezy LoveJoy
Breezy LoveJoy, Breezy LoveJoy, Breezy"
"I think you got it."

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley, Background Singers]
When she loved me, I was untrue to her
I did her wrong, I told her lies
I broke her heart, tore it apart
And I know, I know I hurt her deep down inside

When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking up at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore that he threw eight, oh

Stagger Lee told Billy
I said don't you go with that
You done won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat, oh
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty-four
He said "Don't nobody move
Just to I'm gonna pay that debt I owе"
Go on, Stagger Lee, get down now

"I said please don't take my life
I got me three little children
And a very sickly wife." Oh oh

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad

And it broke the bartender's glass

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

You know our lovе will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our lovе will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away

[Verse 1]
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Peals of fragile thunder, keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come
Some sing blue
Hang your heart on laughing willow
Stray down to the water
Deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea
Swift undertow

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
See how it feels in the end
May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you
Soft, strong, sweet and true

[Verse 2]
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow
Tapping at the window, touch your hair
So swift and bright
Strange figures of light, float in air
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night
You're still by my side
Shining side

[Bridge]
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go, we just ride
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone - both dream and lie

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
Feels like it might be alright
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Love still rings true

[Verse 3]
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach it
It just slips away when I try (Try)

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes, I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh)
Listen, here it comes again

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on, clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun wеnt down in honey
And the moon came up in winе
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us too busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh)
And the band keeps playing on

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on, clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Outro]
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gon' sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big rivеr
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Wеll, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
Raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he steppеd to the bar
Drank to the dregs of thе whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars though it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright 'cause I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright 'cause I love you
That’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come 'cause it looks like rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Whole world's turning gray, it looks like rain
Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, ooh
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come) Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, ooh
Ooh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Whole world's turning gray ('Cause it looks rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
Whole world's turning gray
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come) Brave the storm to come
('Cause it looks like rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come) Brave the storm to come
('Cause it looks like rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourinе
Close the gap of the dark yеars in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
I turn and walk away then I come 'round again
It looks as though tomorrow I'll do pretty much the same
I must turn down your offer, but I'd like to ask a break
You know I'm ready to give everything for anything I take
Someone called my name, you know I turned around to see
It was midnight in the Mission and the bells were not for me

[Chorus]
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain

[Verse 2]
Ten years ago, I walked this street, my dreams were riding tall
Tonight I would be thankful, Lord, for any dream at all
Some folks would be happy just to have one dream come true
But everything you gather is just more that you can lose

[Chorus]
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All the things I planned to do I only did halfway
Tomorrow will be Sunday born of rainy Saturday
There's some satisfaction in the San Francisco rain
No matter what comes down, the Mission always looks the same

[Outro]
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again, walking along in the Mission in the rain
Come again

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
Thеre's people thеre who care a thing about me
They won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Outro]
We're gonna take a short break, we'll be right back, so everybody hang loose

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, could be the last time
Delilah she sat down on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, God knows she talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
But he ripped that beast, God knows, he killed him dead
The bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stеphen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfingеr dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And thеre follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Now, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, well, coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us

Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo (Come onand daydream)

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Light your fuse, shine your shoes
Hand to you's them old U.S. Bluеs
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your lifе, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
Them old United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my my, my my my, oh)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matchеs and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So inviting
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Come on lazy lightning
You're a loop of lazy lightning, hoo

[Outro]
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of, loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Oh, come on lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of, loop of crazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, if this is real now
Got to tell me, girl
I've heard it said, baby, there's something wrong with my head now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Got to like me now
Cause me such excitation
Don't you fight me now
Cause me excitation
Don't you fight me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Got to like me now

[Verse 1]
Come on all you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Want you to tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
Some folks look for reasons
Others look for rights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
Well, I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand

I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Gotta get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a littlе more ground
Bound to cover just a little morе ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I am having a hard time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 1: Bo Diddley]
Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' all in my pockets
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now I'm a man
And I made twenty-one
You know pretty baby
You and I can have a lot of fun

[Chorus: Bo Diddley]
I'm a man
I say man
A hoochie coochie man
Evil
And nasty
Evil
And most untrustworthy
I'm a man
I say man
A hoochie coochie man

[Outro: Bo Diddley]
1958 —  1958 was a hell of a year. Yes, that was the year that rock and roll got a toehold. I'm here to tell you all about it, baby. You wasn't cool unless you had a 1957 Chevrolet, with pipes and a foxtail hanging from your radio antenna, out of sight mudflaps, have mercy. And most of all, the cats had something written on the side of the door, for all of the girls just to dig. Usually, you would see something on it like "Sweet Daddy," have mercy. What I had on mine was "Daddy Whipped Crеam." Whoa-oh-oh-oh. I've seen 'em all. I've been on thе stage with some of the greatest. Cats like Jimmy Clanton, the magnificent Bobby Darin, Fabian, Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed, and the incomparable John Lee Hooker. Whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, my, my, my, my, my, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, baby, baby, baby. I've seen 'em all. Elvis Presley, Sarah Vaughn, and the great Dinah Washington, Brook Benton, and my man, out of sight cat, Ray Charles. James Brown and the Famous Flames. Whoa-oh. Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, Chubby Checker, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah. Baby, you know I've seen 'em all. Whoa, now, baby, baby, whoa-oh. I'm here to tell you 'bout it, yeah. If you don't think I know what I'm talking about, go home and ask your big brother or your big sister, have mercy. Better and still, go home and ask mom and dad about it, they might tell you the truth, ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, I've seen 'em all. Woo, woo, woo, ooh-ooh-ooh. Before I step back, I gotta tell you about this: In 1958, going back to the Brooklyn Fox Theater, and the Paramount, have mercy, I remember the time when the kids used to come in to see the show and they'd bring their lunch, because they didn't go to school. The school officials used to send out the truant officer to get 'em — he end up bringing his lunch, too. 'Cause we was in there sockin' it to 'em. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental]

[Interlude: Bo Diddley]
Come on, y'all, clap your hands
Hey, hey, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

[Instrumental]

[Interlude: Bo Diddley]
Ooh
Ha ha ha ha
I can't believe I ate the whole thing
Yeah, you ate it, you were the only one here
Try it, you'll like it
That's what I did, tried it and that's why I'm in the doctor's office now
Ah, I want everybody to clap your hands, come on, get together

[Instrumental]

[Interlude: Bo Diddley]
Hey, come on, y'all
Let's give the piano a little bit
Go 'head, piano, take a little bit

[Interlude: Bo Diddley]
Whoa-oh, ow, ooh

[Outro: Bo Diddley]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you to have yoursеlf one hell of a good time hеre this evening
We can have a good time without any problems
Everybody do their thing because we wanna do it again in the future
Have mercy
So, get happy, but don't get nervous, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Intro: Bo Diddley]
Alright now, a little tune that I had the pleasure of recording a few years ago, recently covered by some very good friends of mine, The Rolling Stones, a little thing entitled "Mona."

[Refrain: Bo Diddley]
Oh, Mona
Ooh, Mona
Hey, hey hey hey, Mona

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna stop and thank you baby
I wanna stop and thank you baby

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I open my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything was such a bore
All the things I've done seems I'vе done them beforе
But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna stop and thank you baby
I wanna stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

But you brightened up all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna stop and thank you baby
I wanna stop and thank you baby

[Chorus]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

[Verse 2]
Oh, fare you well, I never see you no more
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh, who been your baby, sister? I've been gone
A little bitty boy, there they are, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Never seen her baby sister
I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone, so long
So long, I've been gone so long, I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long
I never got your baby sister, man, but that just ain't thе way
I've been out of town a long, long time
My, my, a year and a day
And I'vе been gone so long, I've been gone so long
So long, so long, I've been gone so long, gone so long
I've been gone so long, I've never seen your baby sister
No man, I ain't ever seen your baby sister
I've been gone
Feel like a stranger here
I've been gone so long, been gone so long, I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long, I've been gone so long, I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long

[Outro]
Donna Godchaux, our new piano player, Keith, New York City

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Oh, get back truckin' on
AH, get back truckin' on
AH, get back truckin' on
AH, get back truckin' on
AH, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
Get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
WAH, get back truckin' on
WAH, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Got a letter this morning, and all that it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around and the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Take it, you can have it
What I've got, baby, I can't hold
And if you find the secret
Tell me how to build the mold
And I can't handle your problems
So don't try to handle mine
Get yourself a shotgun, a pocketful of shells
And we can while away the time

[Chorus]
Get it right, do it nice
So if you make a mistake you're going to pay for it twice
But if you need it, got to have it
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home

[Verse 2]
Look up the wall, you know you gotta call
Before you start falling, be ready to fall
And if you fallin' my direction
Don't expect no help at all, go on

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Get it right, do it nice
And if you makе a mistake, you're gonna pay for it twice
But if you need it, got to havе it
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home

[Outro]
Look up the wall, you know you got to call
But if you start falling, be ready to fall
If you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all
Don't expect no help at all
Don't expect no help at all
If you fall in my direction, don't expect no help at all

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse 2]
I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretеnd it came to an end
'Cause you wеren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
But I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Done better by me than I've done by you

[Verse 3]
Now what's to be found, racing around
You're carrying your bag wherever you go
I'm full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, oh, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
Turn it around, that's what I'm gonna do
Going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Turn it around, that's what I'm gonna do
Going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
You've done better by me than I've done by you
I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse]
The news is out, all over town
That you've been seen out running around
I know that I should leave her there
I just can't go, you win again

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
I just can't go, you win again

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do? You win again

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do? You win again

[Verse 1]
I take a little powder, take a little salt
Put it in my shotgun, and I go walkin' out

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 2]
I won't even take your life, won't even take a limb
Just unload my shotgun, take a little skin

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you take a silver dollar, take a silver dime
Mix it up together in some alligator wine
I can hear the drums, voodoo on my lawn
Mister Charlie tellin' me, can't do nothin' wrong

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 4]
Well, Mister Charlie told me, thought you'd like to know
I'll give you a little warning, before I let you go

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), wolly bully (Wolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Outro]
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me
Mr. Charlie told me so

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands

[Outro]
Hey, uh, for all you "Alligator" fans out there, we've done — ah, ah, right, we understand there's a lot of "Alligator" fans but we done forgot it, see. And so, uh, we're gonna have to remember it sometime later, you know? Does that make any sense? Thanks, I needed that

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I'm going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Outro harmonizing]

[Verse]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got yourself to blame

Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book says, you gotta just reap what you sow

[Chorus]
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
You were wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
Well, you liеd, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
You werе wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Outro]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got yourself to blame
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book says, you gotta just reap what you sow

Thank you

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Intro]
This one kinda speaks for itself
Time for a crying song, folks

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright, I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever wakеn to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from thеir cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright, I love you
That’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Whoa, looks like rain
Turning gray, looks like rain
Whole world's turning gray and it looks like rain
Don't tell me, it sure 'nough looks like rain
Oh, oh, oh, looks like rain
Turning gray, looks like rain
Oh, oh, oh, looks like rain
Turning gray, surely looks like rain
Oh, oh, oh, looks like rain

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Now my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for thе gun that he wore
My challengе was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Outro]
Thanks, Texans

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss mе when I'm gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms, yеah

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be bettеr off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And hеaded for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in just a few minutes

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
Some folks trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Oh, just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on thе land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on thе land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We're gonna take a break, we'll be back in a few minutes. Thanks, folks. If you missed that, we're gonna take a break for a little while, come back as usual and all that, you know

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 1]
What are they feeling when they look in each other's eyes?
What are they seeing when they see each other's eyes?
Is it a love I've never known
Or an emotion that I've outgrown?
Did I take a wrong turnin' on life's winding road?
Someone please help me find the, find the right way to go
My life needs some correction, alteration in direction
Won't someone come with me for a while, for a whilе
Yes, yes, I'm lost
Yes, yеs, I'm lost

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
What is the secret of this tie that binds?
Two souls in communion, both body and mind
Is it special magic or just the nature of things?
Conceived of great spirit, not for beggars but kings
You who have found it, please help me along
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm not made out of stone
My needs they are simple, I don't want many things
But I surely do wanna fly on them wings, on them wings of love one time
Oh, yes I do

[Outro]
Won't somebody please help me
Help me take a ride on them wings
Sweet little wings of love
I'm a stranger, yeah
Help me somebody
Oh, all I need, all I need
I just need a little help, just a little help
Just a little help from my friends
Help me somebody please
I wake up early in the morning
And my pillow, and my pillow, and my pillow
And my pillow's all soaking wet
Don't go to strangers, baby
Come on home with me
Come on, come on, come on home with me
Ah, yeah
All I need

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like WIllys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Rolling over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Rolling over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Sweet flowing daydream
Sunshine daydream
Rolling over a daydream
Come on over daydream
And I sunshine daydream
Sweet flowing daydream
Ah, sweet summer daydream
Ah, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sweet flowing daydream
Hey, ah, sunshine daydream
Hey, ow, hey, ow

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love
Hurt you all the time

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
You love him a little more
When you should love him less
Why pick up behind him
And take his mess?

[Chorus]
’Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
You love another man
Now you know that I love you
But you love him regardless
Stick to him just a lot like glue

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, he better leave you
Or you best put him down
I just can't stand to see
See you pushed around

[Chorus]
’Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Outro]
Thank you

You're going to give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love's bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Love's for real, not fade away
Not fade away

Evening, folks

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing at the old academy
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the placе is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, one morе Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel 6, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, take out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Bridge]
Watch me now

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night

Another Saturday night
Hangin' on a Saturday night
Woo-hoo, hangin' on a Saturday night

Rock up, roll and get the papes
Chop them hoes and then you skate
Back to the block with the plate
Grams to O's, slabs to whole ones
A young nigga holdin', big face foldin'
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine
First nigga fuck up to get flatlined
Pack still stainless, Coupe and Verts brainless
Y'all don't wanna fuck with me
The trunk be bangin', off the chain danglin'
Y'all know that I'm from CP

OutKast with a K, yeah, them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga tryna impress God
We'll pull your whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas think it's
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pitbulls went out of style
Made a vow to myself if it's for the wealth I'll stop
Well, put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season
Hey, winter, spring, summer or fall, I dont stall
Slow drag with your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side, don't fall
All y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer
And on that 2Pac in front of them ooh-wops

Talkin' loud, talkin' 'bout that's gangsta shit

Shined up my shoes and jumped in my ride
Feelin' like a pimp, doin' fifty-five
In a five-seven, clean as a reverend
LS3, so G, keep my engine revvin'
Hella Heaven, you can't tell a legend (What?)
See, what you don't know and won't know, enjoy your beverage
Separate with severance, I'm Rich Paul and Maverick
Libra gang, so you know that I'm leveraged
I keep that black book and the black heat and seldom seen
Like I own a hundred thousand Krispy Kreme's
I'm doin' doughnuts, the homies go nuts
See when Dogg in the town, nigga, we turn up

I'm double R from the O, I mean a long time ago
He took me from the 9-8 block to the indo store
So I can make a quick purchase and run it back
I'm on my Silicon shit, spent ten, made back a hundred stacks
It's amazing how I hustle in so many ways
Count revenue streams in so many ways
We never watch the clock, so we don't know how many days
I'm the quarterback 'cause I got so many plays
Digitally bit, physically fit (Yeah)
Snoop Dogg and The Mekanix, nigga, this that shit
Bang that, bang that, bang that, slap
Make a nigga say, "Bring that back" (Bring that back)
Now, do I like her or do I love her?
I put my shit in gear and burn rubber
Spice One and Short Dogg on the zap mayne
You wouldn’t know about it, nigga, its a Bay thang
Dope era, beast mode
Candy paint, Zenus and Vogues (Yes sir)
More deals to close, more bills to fold (Uh)
Get you bread, homie, and stack that shit by the loads

Dippin' and drippin' I keep it on me I'm trippin'
Whole lot of women, they all say that I’m different (Yeah, damn)
Fitted to my toes, I like bank rolls
Bitch you need speed it up, you know the bank finna close (Numbers)
A kick in the freezer, a 40 in the stove
I cried in the trap when I lost Quinn Coleman
You don't wanna see me win, I keep my head up
I'm goin' hard everyday and never lettin' up
What's happenin'?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Niggas don't want you to keep your head up (Yeah, uh, damn)

Recognize game when it's in your face
And when I pull up, all you hear is "Everlasting Bass"
Say what up to my young life, give dap to the G's
Kiss some aunties and models that’s happy to see me
Snoopy D-O-double, where you been?
On Highway 110 doing a hundred and ten
Back in the building like I forgot something
Mekanix on the beat, you know it knock, cousin
Flow dippin' and slidin', Crippin' and ridin', sittin' on candy paint
Dressin' and finessin', lookin’ like a blessing
Making all the hoes faint, the Dogg

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Four-fifteens with thе Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is thе slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Niggas throwing up gang signs

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
Four-nick shells, somethin’ fat on my lap
Couple suckas that'll tell you how I cracked on they hat
Couple suckas that’ll tell you we ain't dishin' out passes
Couple suckas that ain't here and we’ll piss on they ashes, yeah
Twisting up my fingers, send a signal like the blinkers
Get you hit with all these blickies, Nipsey screamin' out the speakers
Hit me on my beeper if it's urgent or you tweakin'
Free my lil' bruh from Kiefer, if he snitchin', you can keep him (Yeah)
Show the pink slip if you ain't leased 'em, nigga, shut up
I just stuck my dick all in her mouth, she actin' stuck-up
Why they do the most on Instagram, but never run up?
Probably 'cause I'm ridin' with that yeeky, I got one up (Yeah)
Membership, ask about the Mozzy, niggas been the shit
Benefits, profit off they work 'cause that's what business is
The tentative, all I heard was dividends, I'm all in
On Bloods, we put in labor with kaydas, it wasn't no calling in

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Still sippin' gin and juice while I'm smoking marijuana
I bet you never blew with Obama
Crip walking with my homegirl Martha
While I'm passing joints to Madonna
Who wanna smoke with Snoop? Let's have a smoke or two
Puff, puff, pass, that's what real smokers do
You was smokin' on Gary Payton, I was smokin' with Gary Payton
We not the same, stop hatin'
Triple gold Daytons and the walls is white
Never made it to the league, but live a baller's life (Yeah)
Rest in peace Kobe and Gigi
LA ain't been the same since we lost the homie Nipsey (Neighborhood)
Pour out a little liquor for Pac
And while you at it, say a prayer for the homie Doc
When Snoop drop, I make the world go crazy
It still ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I got four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)
Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
Niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop, The Mekanix)

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
Another one of those Bay Area slappers
Bread in hand, cheese and crackers
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Big Boss Dogg, The Mekanix
Huh, what's happenin', Fab?
It's a dope era we livin' in, man
Ayy, if you don't understand that, you don't understand nothin'
You under-dig what I mean?
We just chopping game right now, man, with the Zap, man
Got the Zap board in my hand
Tuning this shit to— ayy, turn that bass up a little bit like

Turn them highs down right, yeah, right there

Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)

Four-fifteens with the Zap on my lap
Riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
Everybody throwing up gang signs (Crip)
My niggas throwing up gang signs (Suwoop)

[Intro]
(Amplified)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
From The Isley Brothers to the Jackson 5
A nigga give it to you on the Black hand side
Collide and glide 'til we amplified
And do it all together, Electric Slide
It got good to you (Good to you), now you feelin' the vibe
In the Chevy, rollin', ready to ride
Hand out the moon, heavy on the gas
Steady on the mash, now put the fetty in the bag

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's a stick-up, I get to the money with no hiccups
Give two fucks, no goof-ups
No back-ups, no swoop-ups (Nope)
Get stomped out in some motherfuckin' blue Chucks
Yeah, nigga, I'm back
In a 9-4 Cadillac, playin' Zapp with fifteens in the back
Stash thе strap strap then adjust my snapback
Salt and pepper, bеans and rice
Ebony and ivory, domino, dice
Twice as nice, never payin' the price
Bakin' a cake, have a slice
Mustard and mayonnaise, leather and wood (Ooh wee)
Take it from the rich, givin' back to the hood
You know how we do's it
Robbed his ass and rode off to some gangsta music

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
From The Isley Brothers to the Jackson 5
A nigga give it to you on the Black hand side
Collide and glide 'til we amplified
And do it all together, Electric Slide
It got good to you (Good to you), now you feelin' the vibe
In the Chevy, rollin', ready to ride
Hand out the moon, heavy on the gas
Steady on the mash, now put the fetty in the bag

[Verse 2: Goldie Loc]
Give it to 'em, Loc, you know I gotta serve 'em all the time (All the time)
And I ain't gon' quit bangin' until I get mine (Real talk)
Saggin' in my all blue deuce with the rag down
Ayo, Amplified, turn that shit up loud
Stayin' true to the game, that's in my bloodline
Long Beach Eastside, born and raised in 1-5 (1-5)
Gangsta Crip music, C raggin' to the left of me
Only a few real niggas got the recipe
And I ain't gotta say they names
You know it's real deal when you hear a little pain from the home of the braves (Braves)
And we still make it crack-a-lack
Goldie Loc and Snoop Dogg, bring that G shit back
They say they tired of that watered down (Watered down)
They wanna bang some real shit when they ridin' 'round (Ridin' 'round)
That's why I'm spittin' now, so I can never fall off
It's been twenty-plus years I've been Crippin' with the Boss, nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
From The Isley Brothers to the Jackson 5
A nigga give it to you on the Black hand side
Collide and glide 'til we amplified
And do it all together, Electric Slide
It got good to you (Good to you), now you feelin' the vibe
In the Chevy, rollin', ready to ride (Zz, zz)
Hand out the moon, heavy on the gas
Steady on the mash, now put the fetty in the bag

[Verse 3: Big Tray Deee]
Don't cough, break it off or the heat gon' spark
Hair trigger for them figures when I ride and stomp (Get 'em)
No mask, don't ask, just flash the steel
Get cash quick fast or it's caps to peel (ah)
It's the mangler, fidangler, always keep it gangster
Savage, livin' lavish, go hard to see my paper (Get it)
Straight grind, take mine, whatever to make mine
Die before I beg, instead I'd face state time (uh-uh)
All the way live, yeah, just like Lakeside
Doin' dirt, puttin' in work, no play time
Takin' flight for the finer things in life
Still loccin', been a mogul, never changed my stripes
Check the résumé, I dare to say you better lay low
When them G's called Tha Eastsidaz step in the door
All go, y'all know, we stay ready to mash
Weapons to blast, now put that fetty in a bag (Yeah)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
From The Isley Brothers to the Jackson Five
A nigga give it to you on the Black hand side
Collide and glide 'til we amplified
And do it all together, Electric Slide
It got good to you (Good to you), now you feelin' the vibe
In the Chevy, rollin', ready to ride
Hand out the moon, heavy on the gas
Steady on the mash, now put the fetty in the bag

[Intro: J Black]
Ayy bro, who got smoke?
Swisher Sweet, Backwood, fronto, sky zone
Pure hemp what I roll
And a nigga need one pronto, I'm on
High as the condo
OG seasoned cilantro, I blow
I think I left my wallet and lighter in El Segundo

[Chorus: J Black & Snoop Dogg]
I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget
What I needed, I needed (What I need)
Did one of y'all see if I, damn (Can you?)
Searchin' like CSI, yeah (Look out)
'Cause I fucked around and left my weed, damn, damn (I left my weed)
I fucked around and left my weed, oh, damn, damn (Damn, I left my weed)
I gotta go and get my weed, damn, damn (Somebody pull up, pull up)
Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, pull up to front, party goin' live
Everybody happy when the Dogg arrive
Boss in the building, party with a real one
Pocket full of racks and still number one bonafide
Show you right
Post up with a few bottles, a few models
Make a toast to the boss life, I do the honors
I make the hits to make the deals to make the dollars
And I smoke to that
Reachin' in my Louie bag
Tryna find that King Louie stash
Yeah, I'm 'bout to do em bad
Baby wanna take a flick
I'm like, "Cool make it quick 'cause I still can't find my shit"
Reach a little deeper, now I'm mad
No weed in the party, all bad
I'm in the parking lot, headed to the whip
'Cause now this party ain't shit

[Chorus: J Black & Snoop Dogg]
I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget

Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Devin The Dude]
Oh, shit, I did it again
Nigga movin' too quick, tryna get with my friends
To get fucked up, I got my coffee cups and the brewskis
But hold up, I noticed I'm missin' my ooh-weed
Like Snoop D, I need at least two Sweets to soothe me
Blunt wraps, Swishers and loose-leaf
Now I got to go back to the crib
And try to sneak in, I hope my gal don't shoot me
Thinking I'm lying, I'm trying to have a good time
Barbecue, music, the good vibes
Wonder should I make a call to come through with an ounce
When damn, I got two at the house
Now I got to make a decision
Should I hit the back door with precision?
Or maybe I should bum from my coffee brothers
They be gottin' Red Dead Redemption vision

[Chorus: J Black & Snoop Dogg]
I can't believe it, believe it (Damn)
I do this shit every time, damn (Every time)
Get so very high and (So high)
Then forget
What I needed, I needed (What I need)
Did one of y'all see if I, damn (Can you?)
Searchin' like CSI, yeah (Look out)
'Cause I fucked around and left my weed, damn, damn (I left my weed)
I fucked around and left my weed, oh, damn, damn (Damn, I left my weed)
I gotta go and get my weed, damn, damn (Somebody pull up, pull up)
Or somebody gotta pull up on me, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: J Black]
Ayy bro, who got smoke?
Swisher Sweet, Backwood, fronto, sky zone
Pure hemp what I roll
And a nigga need one pronto, I'm on

[Verse 1]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

[Verse 2]
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Bеcause your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Lovе is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

[Bridge]
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl, when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, peace of mind, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me

[Chorus]
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is a woman
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling

Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
I love you a lot
I love you a lot
(And this beat from Cash not from YouTube)
(Matthew, you know you with the ?)
I love you a lot
But if you spill my cup, it’s gon’ be problems, huh
Ride round’ with them goblins
Pour up in a Crush, residue up in the bottom
I don’t wanna rush, sip it slow, I’m tryna drown

[Verse]
Now we been goin’, you been hoein’, still gon’ fuck you
Just because you know a nigga pimpin’, don’t think I’m still gon’ front you
Know everybody got their hands up (Aye)
Same games since the sandbox (Aye)
Slatt, us, us
I wanna rock right now, yeah let’s get it up
I wasn’t tryna duck’ some of 

[?]
Tell your friends to call, now someone need to check em’ home
Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Chorus]
I love you a lot
I love you a lot, ah
I love you a lot
But if you spill my cup, it’s gon’ bе problems, huh
Ride round’ with them goblins
Pour up in a Crush, rеsidue up in the bottom
I don’t wanna rush, sip it slow, I’m tryna drown

[Verse 1]
She called me up, she had a hard night
Wanted some love to make her alright
I didn't know that in her mind
We were getting closer when really, we were over

[Pre-Chorus]
Possessive turned to passive in the middle of the night
Now in your vision, I'm the villain, you can't look me in the eyes
I watched your jealousy turn my sincerity
Into dishonesty, but I'll be the bigger person, babe

[Chorus]
I know you havе to hate me
Won't blame you if you blamе me
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal
You've got some harbored feelings
Like I left you for no reason
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal

[Verse 2]
It's for the best, the way it ended
I failed your test, rose-colored lenses
Are what you wore to hide the damage
But you can't fix glass when it's shattered in half

[Pre-Chorus]
Possessive turned to passive in the middle of the night
There's no going back to what we had, no rearranging time
'Cause all your jealousy turned my sincerity
Into dishonesty, but I'll be the bigger person, babe

[Chorus]
I know you have to hate me
Won't blame you if you blame me
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal
You've got some harbored feelings
Like I left you for no reason
I promise even though it hurts
I won't take it personal

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I wish I had known
You'd take it so personal
I wish you'd let it go
Don't take it so personal
I wish I had known
You'd take it so personal
Don't take it so personal
Let us pray
Father god I am just learning how to pray
Bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me
Why? I don't know.
I don't deserve it. And it hurts inside.
Many a nights I cried
Called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin' good. Too proud.
And still you gave me love
I wasn't used to that
Cus' most of the people that gave me love
Ended up takin' it back
It's somethin' new to me
So I'm begging you for time to adjust
Lеt me make it therе
I will be one you can trust
What I stand for
I put my life on, I do
I guess what I'm askin' is
Show me how to stand for you
And I will rap for you
Sing for you
Preach for you
Reach for you
Teach for you
I will love you like you loved me
Unconditionally
And I will always be prepared for whatever the mission will be
Give the nutrition to me
And I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back I will show you word will invest it
And whenever I go, before I go, let me give
Thanks you Lord
For my birth
For every day that I've lived
You gave me your love most of my life I didn't know was there
In the name of Jesus
I give you my life
Because you cared

[Verse 1]
I had a dream we kissed
And it was all amethyst
The underpart of your eyes was violet
You hung a cigarette between your purple lips

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been best buds since thirteen
I hold your head back when you’re too lean
I hold the Taco Bell and you cried over Eugene
He was mean
He was mean

[Chorus]
Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you’re to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been matеs since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Hey, I know I'vе been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say

[Verse 2]
Seein’ you with him burns
I feel it deep in my throat
You put your hands in his shirt
You play him records I showed you
Read him Sylvia Plath, I thought that that was our thing
You know I like you like that
I hate that son of a

[Pre-Chorus]
(We’ve been best buds) since thirteen
But that don't change the things I feel
Oh, when I see you smile with your teeth at Eugene
Yeah, I can’t deal

[Chorus]
Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we’ve been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Hey, I know I've been a little bit off and that's my mistake
I kind of fell half in love and you're to blame
I guess I just forgot that we've been mates since day
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Just yesterday
You were looking up to me
And you would ask me what I thought

But now I'm sitting here
All alone with my tears
Lookin' at my life
That I've bought

Where did I go? (yeah)
My eyes, they will show

Little me
Please forgive me
I couldn't see
You hurting inside

[Intro]
One more game, it's time to play
Play with me (One more game)
Just one more game, it's time to play
Come play my way

[Verse 1]
I'm no more Mrs. Nice Girl, no playing home ground
I'm not the same girl, you never rocked my world
You used me, tried to abuse me
The fame, the life, the fantasy, now back to reality
(You're dramatic) The truth that lies can't hide
I'm not by your side, I'll let you drown in your drama
Run to your mama, see if she can save you
When I'm not around you're so dramatic

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell, you're too dramatic
Understand it's over

[Verse 2]
Baby, fuck you
The things you did, and never thought I'd get a clue
Yeah, you wanted me to be that faithful to you
Not let nobody's body touch my body in positions that we only knew (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I'm gonna give him what he wants and more
Do all those explicit things that I told you "No"
Places you couldn't go, you know where I'm talking
You are too dramatic

[Chorus]
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell, you're too dramatic
Understand it's over

[Bridge]
Ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Come and play, you wanna play?
Come play with me

[Chorus]
You're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell, you're too dramatic
Understand it's over
You're not the one I thought you were
Now there's another ringing my bell
I'm under his spell, you're too dramatic
Understand it's over

[Verse 1]
Well now, I married me a bad girl, I'll tell you why
Bad girls will even do things on the sly
Look for your supper to be good and hot
She never even put a stew bone in the pot

[Chorus]
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
On the road again, sure as you're born

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Went to my house, my front door was locked
Went around to my window, Lord, my window was locked
Jumped right back, shook my head
Big old rounder in my folding bed
Well, I, jumped into the window, I broke the glass
Never seen that little rounder run so fast

[Chorus]
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
On the road again, sure as you're born

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, your friend come by, say he's looking for his hat
Wants to know, "Where's your husband's at?"
She said, "I don't know, he's on his way to the pen"
He said, "Come on, pretty mama, let's get on the road again"

[Chorus]
They're on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
On the road again, sure as you're born
On the road again

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Well, they're on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
On the road again, sure as you're born

[Verse 1]
I talk to my walls about you
Pretty sure they're tired of hearing it
I talk to my walls about you
Now all four know your name
I talk to my walls about you
And I think they agree the room doesn't feel the same
And there's only you to blame
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I talk to my friends about you
Pretty sure they're tired of hearing it
I say I met a guy, and he treats me real nice
Which is good for a change
I talk to my friends about you
And I think they agree my exes weren't always great
And I don't really buy into fate

[Chorus]
But you tell me I'm pretty
And you don't ask for too much
'Cause you know and I know
That promises sometimes can hurt
When it's barely begun
And I don't want this to fall through
Collapsing is what I'm used to
But we're all in agreement
This is something I should hold onto
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 3]
I talk to my mom about you
She thinks you sound wonderful
I talk to my mom about you
And I tell her you are
I talk to my mom about you
And I think we agree I found what I was looking for
And now I know for sure

[Chorus]
'Cause you tell me I'm pretty
And you don't ask for too much
'Cause you know and I know
That promises sometimes can hurt
When it's barely begun
And I don't want this to fall through
Collapsing is what I'm used to
But we're all in agreement
This is something I should hold onto

[Verse 1]
Pack up your things
Here's a bus ticket home
For your troubles
I know it's not ideal
I'll walk you down
And my mom's on the porch
She wants to say goodbye
I know it's not ideal

[Chorus]
But in what world do these things go the way we want them to?
And I know I didn't cry
But I don't think I loved you
And in what world do we exist, not separate but as two?
'Cause I know I didn't cry
And that said something to you
If that world exists, I'd believe
That love might have some chance of being true

[Verse 2]
We have moved on
And it's clear we weren't meant to be lovers
It's obvious sometimes, oh
I know some things now
But it's clear that I don't have a clue
It's obvious sometimes

[Chorus]
But in what world do these things go the way we want them to?
At nights, sometimes, I cry
But these tears are not for you
'Cause in what world do we exist, not separate but as two?
An alternate dimension
Where I love you too
If that world exists, I'd believe
That love might have some chance of being true

[Intro]
And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Verse 1]
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

[Verse 2]
Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Yeah

[Bridge]
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine
You've got to

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine
You've got to

[Chorus]
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be? (You've got to)
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be? (You've got to)

[Verse]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Drop/Build]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Fallen apart, right in front of you

[Drop]

[Slow-Down]
(I've become so numb, I can't feel you there)
(Become so tired, so much more aware)
(I'm becoming this, all I want to do)
(Is bе more like me and bе less like you)

[Verse 2]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Drop/Build]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Drop]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you
By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly and call my name out loud
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go

[Verse 1]
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave

[Verse 2]
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave

[Verse 3]
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Don't leave
Don't leave

[Spoken]
Thank you, everybody
G'night

[Verse 1]
It was early last week, you said we didn't really have that much in common (Common)
But what did you really gain from it? (From it)
We split in two, now you don't want me
Now it's the start of July
You thought that you broke my heart and now every time that you see me you vanish (Vanish)
'Cause you assumed you really mattered (Really mattered)
But I was sound, I had it patterned
Now you're a burden of mine

[Verse 2]
D-D-D-Did you notice I cried, but only just a little bit? (Yeah)
Tell you I lied, then split down in the middle
'Cause you're taking one side, not the side that I like
Because you know I can't lie when you're in my mind
Y-Y-You're too cruel to be kind and I know that from experience
I can hear your replies, but it's maybe that I'm hearin' things
And I heard all your lies, there's no lies that I like
So I'll take that as a sign, you're a burden of mine (Hey)

[Outro]
Mi-i-ine
Burden of mi-i-ine, mi-i-ine
Mi-i-ine, of mine
Mi-i-ine

[Verse]
What he say, what he say
Say impediments, and the random egotistical elephant in the room
Looking for something heaven-sent, like it's medicine in the moon
Or intelligence in the heaviness of a tomb
How much a song weigh? Thirty pounds for every entendre
So the playlist will be as heavy as a spaceship
On a spaceship even though it's weightless
A bar full of plates a waitress weight-lifts with every single entree
Contrary to what the pawns say, he's swan slay with every convey
If words are rocks, birds in flocks stop
This not the chest of the experts
That's a straight rookie move to get him close to the dose
I fed him bread first
Jaded
So denigrated and inundated with every image that I was finished
And in a status of inner stages
So I insulated it in the pages, liberated my inner sages
Ninety minutes from the meetings of my mind
When my mind look like a minister mixed with Dennis the Menace made it
Baited
Beat it, baked it, and ate it
Graciously, my engineer saved the most sacred of it in Avid
Moor
I can sell money to the poor, a pyramid to a mummy
They even have to pay attention when they ignore
My compulsive indecision made addition into a chore
Is two plus two just two twos or is it four
And if I got a calculator, what's the point of even keeping score
But that's not allowed when you tested
So I added it all up, they trying to slow us down like the instruments in Texas

[Outro]
That's all I got
I tried to do it like, in- in less than an hour
But shout out to King Los for the inspiration, you feel me?
Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah
Kore wa, nan desu ka? Hai
Uh

[Verse]
Father was a DJ, so he grew up in the clubs
Learned it from his father, plus he had it in his blood
Played a private gig for the dealers of the drugs
Daughter of the boss loved his grooves and fell in love
Wanted by another whose jealousy increases
He burns his turntables, smashed his records into pieces
Cuts his hands off before he shoots him in the head
Dropped off in the limousinе and leaves him therе for dead
Voice in the darkness said, "I'll fix this for the price
There's spirits that appear only if the music's tight
And if I get 'em all, I'll be ruler of the world
And you'll get your revenge, and your hands, and your girl"
What's up now?
Uh, yeah, what's up now?

[Outro]
Uh, uh, Tokyo Freeze all day, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've payed for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Smino]
Oh

[Chorus: Smino & A$AP Rocky]
Big, got dreams
That's really why I sleep in
Cuz' its better that I won't ever think scared
And I'm prepared for that (Oh)
It's a big world, I got big schemes
And I'm 6'5, if you count wings
And I get by, off what I need (And I get by)
And I need 

[?], and I need freedom (Don't look back)
I just
Super stoned, super high (Hey)
March, April, May, June, July
Super stoned, super high (Haha, uh)
See mushroom clouds in the sky

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]

[?] sleepy, got you pillow-biting, greedy
She gon' eat me like I'm healthy, wow
Vitamin C, C, D, D
Put her right to sleepy, night night, wow
Nightlights, my VVS bright like T.V
Likes no house life
But she housewife type like Nene, wow

[Refrain: Smino]
Do what I wanna (Wanna)
I just wanna scream when I wanna (Ay)

[?] (Bitch!)
I just wanna smoke marijuana
I just wanna drink when I wanna (Sip)
I don't really think when I wanna (Ay)
I'mma go-
Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus]
What's broken 

[?]

[?]
Nice, nice, It's alright
Life's going on
On from here
I hope that you heal

[?] It's alright
It's pretty lies, the nighttime
From here

[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good"
Six words you never understood
"I'll never get you go"
Five words you never say
I laugh along like nothing's wrong
Four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two is us
One slipped away

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is walk the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a twelve step just for you?
Our conversations all in blue
Eleven "heys" (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers pulling out my hair
Ninе times you never madе it there
I ate alone at seven
You were six minutes away

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay?
When all you do is walk the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
I’m not your type
Maybe I’m not your preferred gender orientation
I’m so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, mmh
And I can’t stand another day
I can’t stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I could be soft and sweet
I could be hard and loud
I could be anything
You'd ever need somehow
Why don't you hear me sing out from the lost and found
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Why don't you try on me
Why don't you take me home
I'll match the color scheme of your bedroom walls
Oh, take a dose of me
It doesn't hurt at all
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Oh God, I'd benefit
From your sweet tenderness
Thank God, it could have been
'cause nothing comes from it
That'd be a helpful thought
If I could remember it, but
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Buddah Bless this beat)
Yeah, uh, feel me, nah
Niggas gettin' money in this motherfucker, you feel me?
They'll never feel me, man
It's a million dollar circle, you feel me?

Million dollar niggas around me (Yeah, uh)

Slatt, go, go, go, go, go, go (Uh, uh)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]

Fuck what he sayin', you know that it's up
Fuckin' on twins, geeked and stuck
I'm in a Benz, pushin' the pedal
New FN, ain't no metal
Pray for sins, I might move wrong
Bro off them tens, head in the clouds
Fuckin' this bitch that I saw in the crowd
Told her shut up, she screamin' too loud
Bitch ass nigga, I told you so
Nigga get mad, I fold his ho
Big AKs like G.I. Joe
Niggas be fake like CGI

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Bitch west coast like TDE

Outside in the back of the crib in a tent
Slatt, huh, I got a four-pack, huh
I had to fold the MAC
Drivin' this shit off the track, huh
Yeah, move with them boys, live
Free all my niggas who bangin' the fire'
Jump in the water head first, I dive (Go)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I'm the young nigga who got it

Feelin' 'em pinks and blue in my pocket

[Verse 2: Louie Ray]
Most niggas bootleg like DVDs
They want smoke, that's CBD
Twenty a verse
Gotta get twenty a verse 'cause I blow twenty on lean
Okay, this shit in my genes
And just in my parents, that's how I was bred
I know some niggas that's dead
I'm focused on money, I'm blowin' her head
Okay, she givin' me head
Nigga, this head on the edge of the bed
Okay, I'm high off the Percs
Could've been Nicki, I left her on read
Okay, I'm keepin' it hood
Hat just sittin' on the side of my head
I got a hundred in cash
You know I got burners on side of the bed (Bah)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I'm the young nigga who got it
Pourin' a four in a two, I ain't modest
I cannot move 'til I see a deposit
Feelin' 'em pinks and blue in my pocket
Fuck what he sayin', you know that it's up

[Verse 1]
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi
'Cause you're hungover and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Verse 2]
Why are those lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Bridge]
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
Ha, and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town
No, don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me

[Chorus]
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

[Outro]
That’s what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby

Different when you sitting there alone, nobody else
Different when I think you might be with somebody else

Woah, yeah, woah yeah, yеah
You still wit’ it, when you want it, got to keep me, I am chill
Don’t trip when you see mе out, kickin’ with my new bitch I
Still hang around even though you cappin’, cappin’
I could pretend you was my main, Bet you love just how that feels
Out of my way, you out of pocket, need clear vision
Can’t trust decision when you near me
Get myself caught in your crossfire
You a wild one, and I’m wading in you like it’s cool water
Like it’s cool when you pull up boo’d up with a new and it’s not me
All that I know is mirrors inside me
They recognize
They recognize you oh
Said please don’t deny me
Different so different
Hit it different
When you’re different
It’s different when
Different when you
Different when you
Different when you
Different when i’m sitting here alone all by myself

*Good Days*

[Verse 2]
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out

Too soon I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, Can you get the heck out
I need rest now, Got me bummed out
You so

You
Baby baby babe
I’ve been on my empty mind shit
I try to keep the rest of me
I worry that I wasted
The best of me on you baby
You don’t care
Said not tryna be a nuisance its just urgent
Tryna make sense of loose change got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight can't keep what’s holding me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
All the while I’ll await my armed fate with a smile
Still wanna try still believe in
Good Days always
Always inside good day living in my mind
Sunny Insde
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 3]
Tell me I’m not my fears my limitations
I’ll disappear if you let me
Feeling like uh feelin like Jericho
Feelin like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own my cross to bear alone
Ohh paid a deal way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit gettin good with it, I lose it baby

Not tryna be a nuisance it’s just urgent
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight can’t keep what’s holding me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
All the while I’ll await my armored fate with a smile
I still wanna try still believe in good days, always
Only inside Good day living in my mind
Only inside it's good
A good day living in my mind
Lonely inside it's a good day livin

[Intro]
This is the world premiere
(Here we go) Ha ha
(Here we go) Sophisticado
(You can't stop) We're in mix
It's ka-blamo, yo (Ka-blamo!)

[Chorus]
You just won the lottery, that's ka-blamo!
You kissed Shannon Doherty, that's ka-blamo!
You joined a sorority, that's ka-blamo!
You lied about the lottery, not ka-blamo!
(This is the world premiere)

[Verse 1]
You met Fred Segal at a debutante's ball
You gave him your number, he gave you a call
He told you to meet him at the corner at eight
You met him at nine, that's right, you were late
You stupid idiot, you don't know what you missеd
Fred Segal's a star, and you cold dissed
His pimping-ass cooling-ass Mack-ass building
With diggity ivy on thе wall but not around the lettering
You dissed Fred Segal, and everybody knows
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (We're in mix) you're not ka-blamo

[Chorus]
The doc fixed your arteries, that's ka-blamo!
Your mouthwash is gargly, that's ka-blamo!
Your water is watery, that's ka-blamo!
I majored in pottery, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 2]
You're chilling with your dudes and then they stab you in the face
On the way to the hospital you're bleeding all over the place
Your leg is amputated 'cause you got gangrene
And then you get cancer and you die in your teens
But then this really pretty girl who you always really liked
Shows up to your funeral and that's a real mixed blessing

[Chorus]
Your jello is wobbly, that's ka-blamo!
You met Gilbert God-fer-y, that's ka-blamo!
You're Harlem Globetrotter-y, that's ka-blamo!
You watch the disorderlies, not ka-blamo! (Incredibad, yo)

[Verse 3]
When you're mining for coal and you forget what coal is
And you're sure to be fired, because that's your job!
When a mole's in your ass and you wonder where the mole is
You're screwed man, a mole is in your ass. Job!
The meaning of life is revealed to you
And all of the drinks are old English brew
Your whim is the word of the people on earth
But the whole "mole in the ass" thing is haunting you. Earth!

[Chorus]
When your fluids are bodily, that's ka-blammy
What happened to ka-blamo? I mean ka-blamo!
Good, that's better, that's ka-blammy!
Wait, I'm confused, we said ka-blamo!

[Bridge]
Remix (DJ Paul)
(Hard) This is the world premiere

It's the newest word, say "ka-blamo"
All the cool kids, say "ka-blamo"
It's slightly rebellious, say "ka-blamo"
Your parents will hate it, say "ka-blamo"
What are you afraid of? Say "ka-blamo"
Stop trying to be different, say "ka-blamo"
Come on, just do it, say "ka-blamo"
Come on, just do it, say "ka-blamo"
Come on, just do it, say "ka-blamo"

Burning bridges in the biz, not ka-blamo!
Back breaking labour, not ka-blamo!

Ye (DJ Paul)
Peace king, peace king
Listen, new shit
Ye, peace king, peace king, listen
Peace king, peace king, listen

[Intro]
Listen, listen!
Here we go downtown
Oh boy, oh (garbled) ... all around
You can't stop (garbled)
Ka-blamo!

[Chorus]
You just won the lottery, that's ka-blamo!
You kissed Shannon Doherty, that's ka-blamo!
You joined a sorority, that's ka-blamo!
You lied about the lottery, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 1]
You met Fred Segal at a debutante's ball
You gave him your number, he gave you a call
He told you to meet him at the corner at eight
You met him at nine, that's right, you were late
You stupid idiot, you don't know what you missed
Fred Segal's a star, and you cold dissed
His pimping-ass cooling-ass Mack-ass building
With diggity ivy on the wall but not around the lettering
You dissed Fred Segal, and everybody knows
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, you're not ka-blamo

[Chorus]
The doc fixed your arteries, that's ka-blamo!
Your mouthwash is gargly, that's ka-blamo!
Your water is watery, that's ka-blamo!
I majored in pottery, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 2]
You're chilling with your dudes and then they stab you in the face
On the way to the hospital you're bleeding all over the place
Your leg is amputated 'cause you got gangrene
And then you get cancer and you die in your teens
But then this really pretty girl who you always really liked
Shows up to your funeral and that's a real mixed blessing

[Chorus]
Your jello is wobbly, that's ka-blamo!
You met Gilbert God-fer-y, that's ka-blamo!
You're Harlem Globetrotter-y, that's ka-blamo!
You watch the disorderlies, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 3]
When you're mining for coal and you forget what coal is
And you're sure to be fired, because that's your job!
When a mole's in your ass and you wonder where the mole is
You're screwed man, a mole is in your ass. Job!
The meaning of life is revealed to you
And all of the drinks are old English brew
Your whim is the word of the people on earth
But the whole "mole in the ass" thing is haunting you. Earth!

[Chorus]
When your fluids are bodily, that's ka-blammy
What happened to ka-blamo? I mean ka-blamo!
Good, that's better, that's ka-blammy!
Wait, I'm confused, we said ka-blamo!

[Intro]
Hey, what's up, man?
Nothing?
You'll never guess what happened! Check it, last Saturday my main chicken was like, "You need to take me out for a bubble bath, oil massage and candle light dinner."
Oh, oh, hell not!
That's what I was saying! I had to tell her like this:

[Chorus]
Saturday night is not for romance
You got a whole week to get into girl's pants
Got ladies in the UK and ladies in France
But Saturday night? I'm in my b-boy stance

[Verse 1]
Ahh, Saturday night is the night after Friday
I'm thinking 'bout fly-ass girls out on the highway
I push my celerator and beep my horn
It's not a night for dancing, a night for porn
It's jerking in the bathroom 

[?] with my fellas
I'm talking these broads like rain to umbrellas
Saturday night ain't time for the chick
It's time for thе fellas to watch porno flicks
I'm poking through a hole, no one can tеll
I'm going to bathroom, ring my own bell
Ring the alarm but I'm not the douche naked
It's Saturday night and I'm darting these chickens
Wake up on Sunday, taste food in my mouth
Monday back come, the chicks in the house
Tuesday now, I'm back with my girl
Never let her know about my Saturday war

[Chorus]
Saturday night is not for romance
You got a whole week to get into girls' pants
Got ladies in the UK and ladies in France
But Saturday night? I'm in my b-boy stance

[Verse 2]
Chilling with the girls can be pretty cool
But kicking it with the fellas is a different world
A girl can never understand what it's like to be me
I stand up all day, sit to go pee
Well, it's guys' night out and I'm feeling real horny
Roll to the store for a case of forties

[?] out the window
Let's explore our bodies and smoke some indo
I'd rather watch TV and drink my Jack
I spent my whole Saturday on hitting from the back
Sure, it's all good to get you 

[?] arm
But I'm a dude for all dudes and my word is bomb
Yeah, his words is bomb like the powder for your testies
I'm slithering my boys like 

[?]
I'm there for my dudes and it's more than male bonding
I think it's in the ass and men are responding

[Chorus]
Saturday night is not for romance
You got a whole week to get into girls' pants
Got ladies in the UK and ladies in France
But Saturday night? I'm in my b-boy stance

[Verse 3]
Even though guys are better to bang
Girls stay nice like Michael Chang
Michael Chang no in a lot of Grand Slams
But his attitude is good so he's the man
When we ram about tennis you know we'll always be drunk
My man, Michael Chang's got legs like a tree trunk
Michael Chang, he's down with us
We've never hung out but we like him a lot
Even though he looks young on the tour he's a veteran
A genuine role model Asian-American
C to the H to the A-N-G
Everyone looks tall from his POV
He may not know the feeling of victory
But he's got a lot of H-E-A-R-T
We've never met Chang and that's alright
He can still sleep over on a Saturday night

[Chorus]
Saturday night is not for romance
It's a day for us to get into dudes' pants
Whether it'd be Kurt, Michael Chang or Lance
Saturday night I'm in my b-boy stance

[Intro]
Sandals and socks

[Verse 1]
I knew this cat named Ardy, he wore sandals and socks
When he came to the party, he would make sure it rocks
He would flail his arms around and do the Ardy Dance
Leavin' every motherfucker with funk in they pants

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy that rocks the party

[Verse 2]
Hey yo, it's Friday, you're at the jam of the year
But somethin's missin' there, man, Ardy ain't here
People standin' on the wall, not freakin' at all!
Check it, what you need to do is give Ardy a call
And then 60 seconds later there's a knock on the door (Who is it?)
My man Ardy with Bacardi, saying, "Get on the floor!"
And I been getting' down ever since he said that shit
At the dance club, havin' a conniption fit
Now, who rocks the party more than Ardy? (No one!)
And who smokes base back of the alley? (Ardy!)
When we found him on the street he was homeless and shit
So we addicted him to coke so he'd be dependent
Now, if he wants more drugs, he's gotta rock the rugs
Go down the ho stroll and pick up cock for us
Hey yo, Ardy's got the steps that'll move your body
That's why we like the Ardy that rocks the party

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy who rocks the party

[Verse 3]
Yo, Ardy stinks like a motherfucker drowning in shit
But the crazy part is how much I love that kid
He's intelligent and charming, ugly and disgusting
For a hit of yay he'll do just about anything
"Like suck my dick?" Hell yeah, he'll suck your dick, nerd
You're holding weight, he'll do anything (Word?)
He wears glasses and has a haircut like a clown
And if you got a girl over, you don't want him around
"'Cause he smells bad?" Nah, dawg, 'cause he'll snatch her up
Straight player for real, sporting sandals and socks
Picture the most disgusting fucking man on the planet
Then multiply that by eight, goddamn Ardy's great
Do anything for my ace, even clean his face
When the schmutz starts to dry, plus he always stays placed
In the brand new Tevas, bust the wool socks
You came here to party, he came to smoke rocks

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy who rocks the party

[Verse 4]
Ardy, smoothest cat you've ever seen
The chicks know what I mean (He's so fresh and so clean)
He'll rub up on your leg without warning, start humping it
Oh lord, what's that smell in his pants? He's been dumping it
True game, making all the girls pause
(Ardy you look good with that dump in your drawers)
If Ardy ever stopped rocking you know we would kill him
Roll him up in a carpet and throw him off of a building
So I slip him PCP whenever he's not looking
So he keeps the party jumping from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, he looks good when he's smoking on rocks
And don't forget, y'all, he's wearing sandals and socks

[Chorus]
We like the Ardy who rocks the party
We like the Ardy who rocks the party

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, I knew this cat named Ardy, he wore sandals and socks

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
A little bit acid rain
A little bit celebration
A little bit anarchy
A lack of motivation
It’s painted upon your face
Beautiful hallucination
You can’t get enough
You shake and shake and shake and never say

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No! You gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
Go! You say you got every right!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

[Chorus: Chеster] Bennington
No! You gotta get it insidе!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
Go! You say you got every right!
Push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
Go! You say you got every right!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Blackout, blood in your eye!
You push it back down! Push it back down!
You push it back down, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!
Blackout, blood in your eye!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Floating down, as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So, come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh

[Chorus]
Ain’t nobody finna fuck up my day
I said, oh, skrt up out my way
I said, oh, now today, save that bullshit for another day
Good vibes over here, I said it’s good vibes over here
Good vibes over here, hey my dear, it’s good vibes over here

[Verse]
Aye, all that bullshit is turning me off (Tune in’ me off)
So fun, but everything she say be makin’ me soft
I mean damn, why you be so bland
You better be thankful God made you for who you am, who you are, what you could be
Always talkin’ bout what you should be, then do that
You could be like me if you want to, I mean that
Bein’ broke, trust me I done seen that
Push it to the limit, be a doctor, or a senate (Let’s go)

[Chorus]
Ain’t nobody finna fuck up my day
I said, oh, skrt up out my way
I said, oh, now today, save that bullshit for another day

(30, you a fool for this one)

[Verse 1]
Copy, copy, do you read me
Do you really even need me
You act like you don’t really wanna see me
You just wanna be with him
And that lil nigga wanna be me
So tell me what does that make you?
Tell me what you finna do?
I just wanna be with you
I did my time now and I’m done with you, done with you
I wanted to raise a son with you
I thought I wanted a son by you
I tried to give my light to you
I never lied to you
Like who would ever knew?

[Bridge]
Done, oh girl I’m done, I used to watch you sip rum
You used to ride with my gun
But girl that shit done, oh trust me I’m done
This is no longer fun
You just wanna take my funds
But trust me baby girl I’m done with you

[Chorus]
I thought I wanted a life with you
I shoulda wanted one night with you
But I wanted a whole life with you
Now I’m trippin’, I’m fucked up heavy
Cause you already moved on already
And now I’m lookin’ here sittin’ super blue
Like who would ever knew, done

[Verse 2]
Eight missed calls, from me to you
I’m rushing over, to be with you
I’m calling your phone, you’re just not picking up for me
I met your brother, who met my mother
We’re distant lovers, but I’m there for you
Or at least I was, you like niggas with a buzz
You like rappers just because
I think I done had enough

[Chorus]
Done with you
I  thought I wanted a life with you
I shoulda wanted one night with you
But I wanted a whole life with you
Now I’m trippin’, I’m fucked up heavy
Cause you already moved on already
And now I’m lookin’ here sittin’ super blue
Like who would ever knew, done

[Bridge]
Done, oh girl I’m done, I used to watch you sip rum
You used to ride with my gun
But girl that shit done, oh trust me I’m done
This is no longer fun
You just wanna take my funds
But trust me baby girl I’m done with you

[Bridge 2]
I thought I wanted a life with you
I tried to make a wife out of you
I give a hoe one night, not two
I only had one night with you
I thought I wanted more than just one
But baby girl that shit wasn’t fun
When I started chasing after you, that’s chasin’ after nun’

[Verse 3]
I’m happy on a bad day
And I’m blessed on a sad day
I get guap on a Saturday, a Sunday, a Monday
We were fuckin’ round on Tuesday
I take you back by Saturday
But you don’t learn your lesson, cause’ by Sunday I’m done

[Bridge]
Oh girl I’m done, I used to watch you sip rum
You used to ride with my gun
But girl that shit done, oh trust me I’m done
This is no longer fun
You just wanna take my funds
But trust me baby girl I’m done with you

[Bridge 2]
I thought I wanted a life with you
I tried to make a wife out of you
I give a hoe one night, not two
I only had one night with you
I thought I wanted more than just one
But baby girl that shit wasn’t fun
When I started chasing after you, that’s chasin’ after nun’

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, make some mistakes and you don’t care
Always take me back, you always there
I, I, I, I, I, finally figured out that you was the one
When we settle down, you can have my son
Or daughter, won’t look farther
Gift me the chance, I can be the best father
Lookin’ in your face, same genes as your mother
I see why you love her

[Verse]
Baby, baby, you my baby, don’t be cryin’
In a river, would you save me
Won’t you save me, won’t you save me, ah
I just had to let you know
Late night tryna’ connеct all my X and O’s
I know in the past, we go toe for toе
I put this on my soul I won’t let you go, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, make some mistakes and you don’t care
Always take me back, you always there
I, I, I, I, I, finally figured out that you was the one
When we settle down, you can have my son
Or daughter, won’t look farther
Gift me the chance, I can be the best father
Lookin’ in your face, same genes as your mother
I see why you love her

[Outro]
I, I, I, I, I, make some mistakes and you don’t care
Always take me back, you always there

(EarlOnTheBeat)

[Verse]
I’m with a lesbian, fuckin’ her sister
She got a vibrator that beep like a beeper
She clinch ya boy toes and scream like a Rether
My Bentley coupe that I bought it’s a two seater
I’m finna fuck hoes, then we drive to the Kurey
They sip on the Hennything, get touchy, feely
Feel like V.I.C. because I’m finna get silly
She told me get Lolly, but my name Milly
Deep in the drank, she want to chase her, but I’m not from Philly
Want me to sеarch through my history? Icky, ya feel me?
I done been lied to, finеsse on, backstabbed, flaked on
That’s why I don’t save non my dogs with a cape on
I pop out the clan, Wu-tang, call me Raekwon
Used to big bro, hit his pockets, no mask on
I had the numbers from city to city
I was a bad lil boy like Diddy
Kicked out of school, kicked out the community
Mama felt petty, she thought I was shitty
Now I got a lil money, and by a lil, I mean a lot

Young nigga, who will pop up quick
Got a pocket knife in my left pocket
If you run up on me, that’s an open wound
Niggas actin’ like they on the scene
But they in the house, like a honeycomb
I just took a trip out to Cancun with my main bitch
That’s your dream hoe
Imma fuck the bitch
While you make the bitch, your background
Nigga tryna’ cop? He gettin’ taxed
Joke niggas, get clowned
Talkin’ down, you gon’ catch me round’

FN gon’ rip and leave no anatomy
Got the same gang, same gang since Academy
He don’t want smoke, then apologize nationally

You could fuck on my nigga and I still wouldn’t be stuntin’
If you fuck up my nigga, then he wasn’t mine to begin with
Plus I needed me a reason to end it
He’ll be sorry so he gon’ have to spend it
Imma take that and still won’t be interested

[Intro: RMC Mike]
Yeah
(Who the hell is Carlo?)
Bitch
Ghetto Boyz shit, nigga
Hey

[Verse 1: RMC Mike]
I just pulled off from the 6, pulled up on your bitch, hey
I just pulled up with a stick, put one in your shit, hey
I just started off with shit, now I'm feelin' rich
Unky want a whole brick, meet me at 906
Low-key bro mad as hell, he couldn't find no Tris
He tryna stunt with thirty-six, he need to hide his wrists
Bored with the lean, I grabbed the Vernors, drop a pint in it
I just rolled up a 'Wood with my opp's life in it
Unc' stabbin' niggas in the feds 'cause he got life in it
White bitch got some good head, but she got lice in it
Bitch ain't tryna fuck the squad for free, what's the price for it?
Bustdown Cartier wires with the lightest tint

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
When I die, burn my money, I ain't sharin' shit (Go)
Carbon fiber ARs with trigger hairs on it
My bitch booty so damn big, I could sit a chair on it
Not sittin' in a chair, sit a chair on her (Damn)
Told her I'ma shut her ass up, she keep saying, "Purr" (Damn)
Twelve Wock' lines in a two, think shit a cure (Yeah)
Fucked her raw and didn't catch shit, I am too pure (Yeah)
Almost put a bullet in the wrong nigga, we was not sure
Niggas shouldn't've even returned to our opps, that's your dad fault (Go)
Pulled up in a coupe, it was all black, look like asphalt (Damn, damn)
I let my cash talk (Damn)
This bitch could lay on her back and let her ass walk (Walk, go)
I know you miss your mans
He's never coming back, shit had hit the fan
Knew that I would always be rich, It was in the plans (Yes)
I am in a million-dollar club, I don't flex grams

[Verse 3: RMC Mike]
Eighty monster fangs in my teeth, bitch, I'm X-Man
Unc whip this shit up with perfection, got the best grams
Nigga pulled up with an S10, I let the 'Vette spin
This shit right here'll cave your vest in, it's a FN
I'm just tryna fuck my best friend watchin' Netflix
Draco flash when I send a shot, I take the best pics
Let a nigga touch one of my brothers, equal death wish
Lot of fuck niggas ran out of bound when I step in
Ten thousand blues, shipped 'em outta town just for a necklace
Ghetto Boyz signed Lil Boat, we some legends
Don't come around actin' all weird, that shit depressin'
Ain't nothin' but some killers and some hustlers in my section
PLR with a hundred rounds on it, lethal weapon
Yachty said he like that shit talkin' too, so we connected

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
If RMC stand for Rich Man Clique, then I'm in it too
First car I got was a G-Wagen, it was baby blue
Used to drive my mom's BM-dub, it was a different hue
Ridin' 'round in the whip with a logo the letter after Q
Twenty thousand in cash for a photo, I am not like you
Used to ride around in a stolo, we was different dudes
(We known), known for breaking rules
Dog got out of jail, he doin' right, they tryna call him clone
Say they was gon' rob me, I said, "Who?" like I'm Michael Jones
Niggas be bitchin' too much, they cycle too long

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
It's us

[Verse 1]
I ain't never got the respect that I truly deserved
That's why I park them double M's and R's on the curb (Helluva made this beat, baby)
F8 do two hundred, I'm destined to swerve
All my life, these niggas hated, they really some birds
So when my brother got them birds, we stunted on nerds
They ain't fucking, then it's up, we punting them nerds
We pull up and set the tone, we movе in a herd
Asking, "How I pull in them Ms?", from rhyming my words
How this bitch just lose hеr spot? From irking my nerves
I don't wanna be your friend, you niggas is poor
I don't wanna be your man, you don't know your credit score
Know you burnt your shit out trying to impress the core
Might've burnt myself twice chasing dirty whores
I done slapped this bitch out, we just made a s'more
Gave this bitch a thousand knowing that she want more
And I'm ruthless
I refuse to take that bitch to Ruth's Chris
I refuse to do what he do, you ain't my bitch
I ain't buying you no watch, that ain't my wrist

[Bridge]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I done broke my bank a hundred times to help these niggas
Wouldn't nobody gave a fuck if I wasn't wealthy, nigga
If I get jammed, how many bitches finna write me, nigga?
If I get shot, who at my wake standing beside me, nigga?
Who finna take care of my moms and my sister
When they crying to my picture and they the only ones who really miss me?
Everybody else gon' go on with they damn life
And my bitch'll probably go and be somebody wife
That’s why my back against the wall and I be thinking twice
'Cause would these niggas pay my bills if I couldn't keep on lights?
Bitch say I'm too distant from her, I got every right
I think about my brother Black Gwaluh every night
The lobby trying to hold him down, give ‘em every strike
I really think his lawyer sweet, we might black his eyes
I'm really standing on my toes, half you niggas fried
I ain't breaking shit down ever, I'm gon' sell the pie

[Outro]
Yeah,  I ain't breaking shit down, I'm gon' sit up high
From the D to the A, I might let it fly
Boat
Michigan Boy Boat, yeah
In my final form, nigga
Let's get it
Slatt

[Intro]

It's crazy but it's true, the diamonds look blue (It's a big difference)
Lately, I been thinkin' 'bout puttin' my dick inside Kali Uchis (Bitch)

She tried to tax too much, almost faded the bitch (What?)

Had the ski-mask on the keyboard, act like I’m Gent
Had the ski-mask on yo' lil' ho, everytime I went
Had the ski-mask, nigga, ah
Rack 'em up everytime I pull up (Yeah)
My godson grown as hell, don’t wear no pull-ups (Yeah)
Ride around with

The only reason I know you over there cause y’all don’t do nun (Yeah)
Y'all don't never leave, niggas don’t never eat

She gon' have sex with me, everytime you let her leave
Put the purse up on em, show em how that weather be (Yeah)
It be extra heat, nigga better not mess with me (Yeah)
Only be with gang, don’t like nobody where I'm from
Ain’t got no friends in my bity, bitch quit actin' dumb, huh
Be with my brothers not no others, I ain’t got no love, huh
We do numbers every summer, that's why we got guns
I'm 'bout to make a ton
Serve that rocky cold, Tum-Tum
I can't hit the trap unless I'm 'bout to get a lump sum
Brazilian bitch gon' eat the dick like feijoada
Huh, I'ma pop a Perc' so she can get the best Sada
Freaky bitch gon' eat the dick like cassava
Look her in her eye, like bitch don’t call me Casada
Swing that bitch like Oosthuizen, if you playin’ with my guala
Pull up in some Prada, smoke a nigga like some grabba
Go cucaracha on yo' momma, I could sauce about them dollas
Shoot a nigga if he holla, give a fuck about no problems
When Lil Yachty pulled up in Detroit
They asked me where the choppa was
You know I
Would give it to him if he ain't have no drums

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Ain't nobody solidare, bitch we solitaires
I'm in Detroit, on my face it's some Cartiers
Makin' Ms writin' for these bitches, like I’m Tyler Perry
Praying to my Jesus piece, like I’m Bloody Mary
I (Uh, uh, uh)
My way in her pussy
These niggas too sensitive 'round me, I think these niggas pussy
I rolled up, on a nigga bitch like my name was Tootsie
Might could blow you up, but I need a chunk just like a chocolate cookie
I really am that nigga
I really pull up seven figures, that's one call and they flip niggas
It’s us
Gotta flex everyday, I don't wanna rust, uh
Big shit, sit up in my garage collectin' dust
Respect for being on my jewelry, if I must say
You ain’t suckin' dick, so you better go catch that bus babe
My earrings could protect the whole ice age

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Pussy

[Intro: Lil Yachty]

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]

My bitch pussy so damn bald, thought it was make-a-wish (Wish)
Pullin' up to link my Philly bitch at seven, six (Who?)
Fuck, I mean seven o' six

Free all my niggas down that road staring at them bricks (Bricks)
Shoutout to every real nigga who ain't never switch (Yeah, slatt)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & Veeze]

Throw that work in the water, it get hard when you twist it (Sheesh)
Lil' bro asked for my gun, told him bring it back empty
I ain't never had a pit, I be doggin' these bitches (Yeah)
Where I'm from, niggas killing over Cartier lenses (Hmm-mm)
My doctor still prescribing when I don't got the symptoms
It's enough to feed a village in the stash of the rental (Brr, ooh)
I got enough to buy a house, you see I poke out my dental (Brr, ooh)
The Lord done blessed me with a lot, but every night I be sinnin' (Thank God)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I pray all of my niggas get to millions of dollars (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Baby Smoove]
I'm doing eighty in the twenty-five, I'm just having fun
I seen the police, hit a U-turn, you know I'ma run
I'ma fuck her once and I promise she gon' buy me guns
Nigga, I looked up to Blade Icewood, not Tommy Buns
Twelve hundred dollars for Amiris with the colors in them
I told her, if her friends just like her, then we fucking with them
You the type of nigga pay for friends, I don't fuck with niggas
I'm the type to take a trip to Paris for the shopping district

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I pray all of my niggas get to millions of dollars (Yeah)
Chrome Hearts jeans, Moncler coat cost an Impala (Slatt)
How dare this rap nigga talk tough? He know I'm his father

It's us
Damn, damn
Damn

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Me and Vezzo don't do double cups, yeah, we triple stackin' it
Lucky I came in with my bitch, them hoes, I would've cracked 'em
Last nigga speak on my name (What?), a random person jacked him (Yeah)
If I die, I'll be on CNN like Michael Jackson
Not 'cause I died, but who I brought with me
Don't let my bitch drink at all in case I need a kidney
Double R parked right outside like a raisin in the sun
Sheriff pulled me over skeptical 'cause all my legal guns
I'm backwards, I got rich off of music and got illegal funds
Why this stripper, she ain't let me fuck? Still kept all the ones (Damn)
Damn (Damn), and I ain't no sucker (Damn)
House by the lake with the views opposite from Tucker (Damn)
This nigga pussy, goin' out bad just like no other
My shooter ain't got no sense, he stole from his mother
How you know I fuck your bitch, you still call me brother? (Damn)
You niggas, niggas different (Damn, damn)
Why I'm so specific (Go)
Backyard look Pacific (Go)
Heavy on my pivot, uh (Go)
Hit the frog sweat, now my cup look like a midget, huh (Damn, damn)
Geeked up off the medics
Said it, then I meant it
Cops ask me questions, I'm Cole Bennett, I ain't in it (Woo)
The way that Vezzo drive his Wraith, could tell he ain't rent it

[Verse 2: Icewear Veezo]
We gon' hit them boys
Hundred hangin' out the chop, look like a mixin' board (Like I'm mixin')
All my opps be broke as fuck, they need to fix them boys (Niggas fucked up)
Knock the power out that F&N, I need to switch the cord (I need to switch the cord)
Bitch, I love to switch my fashion
Lit the Patek, I got sixty glasses in my kitchen cabinet (That Hi-Tech)
I just bought another Rollie up at Golden Sun (Gold)
Poured a four in a one-liter, that's a forty-one (Drank God)
We just upped the score again, them niggas oh-and-one (Niggas losers)
They think cuddy marchin' for a band, the way he blow that drum
Mix the Louis with the Fendi, I be mix-matchin' (Yeah)
The clip look longer than the Glock, they think the stick backwards
I drop dirty at probation, I just piss Actavis (No cap)
Used to trap right on the Horn, now I got six mansions
Shoot the Chrome Heart off his hoodie, that's how he drip fashion (Leave him leakin')
This bitch asked me was I broke? Oh, that's a trick question (Stupid ho)
Put the Karo with the water, bitch, I mix classics (Skrrt)

[Verse 3: Rio Da Yung OG]
Gen5 Glock 19, thirty clip saggin'
Amiri joggin' fit, dumb bitch, I hit licks in fashion
Last nigga I popped up, I had on Big Bastard
Oversized Virgil Abloh hoodie, this a big jacket
Damn near three racks for the varsity with the big patches
Jumped out with thirty clip, hawked him down, he kept zig-zaggin'
Ran up on him, when he hit the ground, pushed his shit backwards
Real lean plug, nigga, I could still get Acty
Rubber band AP on thirty racks if a bitch askin'
If you ever seen me run from a nigga, I shot the stick backwards
Made dog shit off spittin' fire out my mouth, call me big dragon
Oh, we was talkin' 'bout white buffs? Lou got six glasses
Plug got five seals, eight quarter pints, and six glasses
Ho tried to leave me, shot her car up and broke the bitch chassis
Eight lines of Wock' in one cup, we sip molasses
Drive the bitch car and get some head, damn, I'm finna crash it
That gold 'Dweller fifty-six plain, think I'm finna grab it
Thirty racks hangin' out my pocket, got me feelin' chatty
My city small, nigga think he gettin' away, I can get the addy
I don't really be fuckin' with the Percs, but I can get the Xannies
My shooter got ADHD, he'll kill you for a script of Addys
I was finna fuck my bitch mom, but I can hit the granny
You ain't never had a glass pint of red, it came in a casket
My fiend call me for a twenty stone, I came with a basket
I'm takin' niggas' guns in the club, I came with a magnet

[Intro]
What? Yeah. You done fucked up this time, baby

[Verse 1]
DMX, sliding my son to the left
And you cats ain't ready for what's next (What?)
A lot of brothers out there, they sound like X
But don't look like X and don't get down like X
It's going down
'Cause the word around town is lil' man straight act like a clown
But that's my boy
And just seeing him be born and then blow up will give a nigga joy
See, I'm the type of father that'll give a kid a toy
Then put my foot up his ass 'cause he's a little boy
'Cause that's how you gots to do 'em
First you talk to 'em, give your heart to 'em
Then give a bark to 'em
Still don't listen? Then give a spark to 'еm
Come up missin', had to give the dark to him
Feel my pain
It's gon' hurt mе more than it's gon' hurt you to stop the rain
C'mon

[Chorus]
Bust Money in his head
And lay the fool out
Bust Money, leave him dead
He shouldn't have pulled out
What the fuck Money said?
Make him shut his fool mouth
I get the tools out
Y'all niggas is ruled out
Bust Money in his head
And lay the fool out
Bust Money, leave him dead
He shouldn't have pulled out
What the fuck Money said?
Make him shut his fool mouth
I get the tools out
Y'all niggas is ruled out

[Verse 2]
No the fuck he didn't
Start over here, took it over there, man you gots to be kiddin'
But that's the type of bullshit that cats be on
And cats stay on, 'til one day cats is gone
Rats stay on cats like glue to come through
On some happy shit, the rat flip and split your crew
On some "Get at Me" shit, I'll back flip and hit you too
"X is my man!" Fuck that, bitch, you knew, nigga
Don't walk the same
It's motherfuckers like you that cheat the fans and short the game
It's your fault some niggas think New York is lame
Ain't been caught doing nothing but walking strange
Nigga, back to the streets
Stalk and aim, you know how I'm gettin' down, what's my name?
It's 'bout to be a wrap for all you dick riding niggas
And what, pussy? Yeah, it's like that

[Chorus]
Bust Money in his head
And lay the fool out
Bust Money, leave him dead
He shouldn't have pulled out
What the fuck Money said?
Make him shut his fool mouth
I get the tools out
Y'all niggas is ruled out
Bust Money in his head
And lay the fool out
Bust Money, leave him dead
He shouldn't have pulled out
What the fuck Money said?
Make him shut his fool mouth
I get the tools out
Y'all niggas is ruled out

[Outro]
How many times I gots to tell you (if you didn't know, you know now)
This shit is mine and it's not a fucking game
Man, listen
What the fuck man?
Y'all niggas can't be fucking serious
Just 'cause you sound like me
Don't mean that you get down like me, faggot

[Intro: Apple Martin]
Three, two, one

Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright

And I think my shoe's untied (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
You've got a higher power
You've got me singin' every second, dancin' any hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
You're once in any lifetime
I'm going a million miles an hour

[Outro]
When for so long, I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long, I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on
Ee-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'm A-okay, because my eyes can see horizons far away
Where a life can be a light and not be vain
Stand up and say what you wanna say
You dream of the day, when the ones who call the shots don't stop the wait
See the ocean in every drop and in every grain
See the love and the love for 

[?] to gain
The one they'll say

[Chorus]
And then we'll run into the sun
Find our way up
And we'll run into the sun

[Intro: Sample]
I don’t know what you have got girl, no baby
Or just what keeps you on my mind, I…

[Verse]
I used to be broke boy, no lying, oh, oh, oh
Now a nigga just flyin’
When I come through the hood they say you shinin’
I did everything a real nigga would
Got my dad up out the hood
Bought my momma G’ wagon with the wood
Took my niggas round’ the world, it’s understood
I’m the man, got good, amen
Had to walk through the rain just to get where I am
Self made, I might be President
It ain’t hard there is plenty evidence

[Outro: Sample]
I don’t know what you have got girl, no baby
Or just what keeps you on my mind, I…
I don’t know what you have got girl, no baby
Or just what keeps you on my mind, I…

[Verse 1]
It's complicated
It's how you laid it out
Everything is changing
You say we're fadin'
You say we're weighted down
Oh baby, you should know by now

[Pre-Chorus]
That you can't stop me

[Chorus]
So do what you gotta do
Say what you gotta say
Go if you gotta go
But I hope you stay
Me, I'm gonna stand right here
I guess I still believe in
You and me somewhere out there
So baby, I believe in
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Verse 2]
Brokenhearted
Ain't how we started out
That's where we are now
But we can make it
If you could just hold out
And baby I can't just lay down

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't stop me

[Chorus]
So do what you gotta do
Say what you gotta say
Go if you gotta go
But I hope you stay
Me, I'm gonna stand right here
I guess I still believe in
You and me somewhere out there
So baby, I believe in
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Bridge]
Letting always one thing I can't
Seem to comprehend
This ain't something I can just turn
On and off again

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what you gotta do
Say what you gotta say
Go if you gotta go

[Chorus]
But I hope you stay
Me, I'm gonna stand right here
I guess I still believe in
You and me somewhere out there
So baby, I believe in
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me
You can't stop me

[Ending]
Loving you
Mmmh

I just bought the Bentley, I'm swervin' (What?) (PJ Pipe It Up)
I pull up to…

[Verse 1]
Oh...
It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling, yeah, ooh
It's impossible for me to give you what you need, oh yeah
If you're always hiding from me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what hurts you
I just, I wanna make it right
'Cause boy, I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind

[Chorus]
It's impossible (Impossible)
Ooh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible) for me to love you
It's the way it is
It's impossible (Impossible)
Oh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible)
If you're makin' it this way

[Verse 2]
Impossible to make it easy
If you always tryin' to make it so damn hard, ooh, yeah
How can I, how can I give you all my love, baby, oh
If you're always, always puttin' up your guard? Oh

[Bridge]
This is not a circus
Don't you play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on going up and down?

[Chorus]
It's impossible (Impossible)
Oh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible) for me to love you
It's the way it is
It's impossible (Impossible)
Oh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible)
If you're makin' it this way
Impossible, baby (Impossible, Impossible)
Oh, if you're makin' it this way, this way
Oh baby, it's impossible
If you're makin' it this way

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
Well, I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman arе gonna flood you, big river
Hey, I'm gonna sit right herе until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

Can we have a little monitor action, dare I ask? (Hey, can we have some different light?) Now Bill wants the light changed. (Quick, quick.) Bill's tired of this kind of light, he wants a different color. You're probably wondering why we have so few of you here tonight

[Verse 1]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way
And I ain't gonna bе treated this a-way

[Verse 3]
Well, shе went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune

Winds don't blow

[Chorus]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Verse 1]
Well, you got me working boss man, workin' around the clock
I want a little drink of water, you sure won't let me stop

[Chorus]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Well, you ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

Well, now, I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right
I work hard in the daytime, sure get drunk at night

[Chorus]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?

[Verse 1]
Mason died on Monday, we bricked him in the wall
All his children grew and grew
They ain't never grown so tall before
They may never grow so tall again

[Verse 2]
We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day
Taught him all he ever knew
They ain't never knew so much before
They may never know so much again

[Bridge]
Mason was a mighty man, a mighty man was he
Always said when I'm dead I'm gone, don't you weep for me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
The wall collapsed on Wednesday, we chalked it up to fate
All his children ran and hid
They ain't never hid so fast before
Swore they'd never show their face again

[Verse 4]
Thursday came then Friday, with buyers tall and bright
But Mason's children cooked the stew
And cleaned up when the feast was through
Swore they'd never had such times before

[Bridge]
Take me to the Reaper Man to pay back what is owed
If he's in some other land, write it off as stole
Hey

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Take me to the Reaper Man to pay back what is owed
If he's in some other land, write it off as stole

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can the weather command?
Just wanna have a little peace to die
And a friend or two I love at hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Fever rolled up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Bridge]
See here how everything
Leads up to this day
And it's just like any other day
That’s ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun, it going down
Shine through my window
And my friends they come around
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people may know
But the people don't care
A man could be as poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let’s go run and see
Run and see
Run and see
Run, run and see
Run, run, run and see

[Instrumental]

Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

From San Francisco, The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down to the sea
Try to see what's going down, down
Try to read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
Lord, is running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down
'Til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

- A big hello to all you radio listenin' fans. I hope to tell you it's hot here. This is rock and roll, folks, hot and sweaty. Pigpen's a little sick, and he didn't come with us this time, but we know that we can count on you guys' best wishes for Pigpen, who's sick at home. Thank you, folks. We got a new piano player and organ player with us this time, Keith Godchaux from California. That's all you need to know. And that doesn't make it any bit cooler in here
- Hey, during numbers, between the numbers, can we have a lot more light on the stage? Don't change the light because nobody can see, they're all around near their dials and switches. Thank you
- Right, right, it's a little too romantic in here. (You wanna turn up my monitors so I can hear myself?) Yeah, turn up the monitors like crazy, it's difficult to hear here, man. (If not impossible) Okay, I'll move my microphone back and see if that affects a change, makes it ring in a different place. Woo. Ahh

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybrеak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon thе sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Oh, shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Well, it seems like all the folks up in front here are crowded against the stage. I mean, really, look at this. They're all bending over double. You don't believe that, is that right? No, no, well, obviously the people in back don't believe it. No, you can't have this. So, the point being, if all the folks in back would move back just a hair...

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it just couldn’t be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, hot damn, he won’t grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

I guess what I'll do is I'll take this opportunity to tell you all a story (Don't let him get away with this one). A few of you might have heard this one before. Sounds like it's beginning to work, maybe I won't tell it today

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to gеt you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks, down under the bеd
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Got a letter this morning, and all that it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around and the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
Now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
Ain't no winner in this game, he don't go home with all
With all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Now my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Well, I went to the depot, never got there on time
Well, I went to the depot, never got there on time
Well, the train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Then I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

Try not to push, there's people up here who are visibly shaken. So if everybody in the back would kinda like step back a pace or so, actually the sound is best about thirty feet out from the stage anyway, you can hear the P.A. and all that. So, uh, you know, consider those squashed in front, there but for the grace of God and all that

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down and just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing near every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to thе California sun
Bobby shared the secrеts of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lalala, lalala

[Outro]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Bridge]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
A lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
A lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

We're having yet another problem with the equipment back here

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
I'd pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzy)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
Well, I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that winе
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way shе shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzy)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for thе gun that he wore
My challengе was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kisses my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup that only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Walking all morning, been walking all night
I don't see much difference between the dark and the light
I taste the rain, I feel the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only lovе can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 2]
The words come out likе an angry stream
You hear yourself say things you could never mean
When the heat cools down, and you find your mind
You got a lot of words you've got to stand behind

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Outro]
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental]
I don't know where you've been, buddy, but that was something new. This is also something new. I'd just like to tell everybody out there on the radio that this is a really fine audience here. And I'm willing to bet you are, too, out there in radio land, even though you don't know it

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, just as plain as black and white
Get prepared 'cause there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Yeah, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, that whole place is going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel 6, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, Lord, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy 'cause you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola and put on your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Ow, ow

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
May be young and crazy but I can't see reason one
For fightin' or complaining when we should be having fun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Wha-ha-ha

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night now
Hanging on a Saturday night
Wha-yow
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Wow, wow
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Wha-yow
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Everybody get right
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, wow

Okay. Okay, folks. That's gonna be all for a while. We're gonna take a little break. (We're gonna take a break for a while.) Yeah, that's right, we're gonna take a break for a while, folks. Turn on all the house lights. (That's right, now we're gonna take a little break.) Turn on the house lights please, house lights, house lights. (We'll be back pretty quick.) Yeah, yeah, yeah, soon, any minute now

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One is in or one goes down
Nothin' for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One heat up or one cool down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
On either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Oh, did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
It's blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Then ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sweet sunshine daydream
Walk you in the tall trees
You're going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Then ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Well now sunshine daydream
Come on over and daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, hey hey

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, hey hey

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
Heat come 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The peoplе passing by would stop and say
"Whoa, my my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "someday you will bе a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Seeing Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode
Thanks a lot, everybody, we'll see y'all later. We'll see y'all in Syracuse tomorrow night

[Verse 1]
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park thе car?
Clothes are on the lawn with thе furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
I wanna tell you but you'll never listen
I'll keep on walking
I wanna tell you but you'll never listen
I'll keep on walking
Over, over, over, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
The lights are on, but no one is home
Everybody wants to be a
Everybody wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a, then it's
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
The lights are on, but no one is home
Everybody wants to be a
Everybody wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a, then it's
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking

[Spoken]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

[Verse 2]
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud-cuckoo-land
And this just feels like
Spinning plates
My body's floating down the muddy river

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followеd her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'm gonna sit right here until I die
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first
And the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow until I burst
Until I burst, until I
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much
You haven't seen enough, you haven't seen
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first, and children

[Chorus]
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

[Verse 2]
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Let me hear both sides
Lеt me hear both sides, lеt me hear both
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Throw him on the fire
Throw him on the fire, throw him on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping
Take the money, run
Take the money, run, take the money

[Chorus]
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed
Everything all of the time

[Outro]
The fathers for the children, fathers for, for the children
The fathers for the children, the fathers to the children
The fathers to the children, the fathers to the children
The fathers to the children, the fathers to the children
The fathers to the children, the fathers

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, okay

[Intro]
Lincoln, Nebraska, The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
They won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And I know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that winе
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way shе shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzy)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
And now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in this game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
Thank you

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was walking down Main
Deep Elliman too
Where all women down there
Got the Texas blues

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, she's sweet and true
The dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea
She brings about every darn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I was walking down the street
With a dollar in my hand
I was looking for a woman
Sweet mama didn't have no man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Outro]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright, I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright, I love you
That’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Brave the storm to come for it surely looks like rain
Turning gray, looks like rain
Turning gray and it surely looks like rain
Looks like rain, feels like rain
Oh, here comes the rain
Turning gray and it surely looks like rain
It looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, oh, it looks like rain
Brave the storm to come for it surely it looks like rain
Oh, oh, turning gray and it looks like rain

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
Woo, round and round
(Round and round, round and round)
Don't take much to spread the word around
She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned off all my lights

[Chorus 2]
Round and round
Woo, round and round

Don't take much to spread me on the ground
Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don't want my love no more
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yеah), yeah, yeah
"Thank you, for a real good timе"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you've been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 3]
Round and round
Woo, round and round
(Round and round, round and round)
Don't take much to get the word around
Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with those other guys
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 4]
I went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love her 'til the day I die

[Chorus 3]
Round and round
Woo, round and round
(Round and round, round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground
I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree where the fruit ain't ripe
Singing yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah yeah

[Outro]
Singing yeah (Yeah), woo, yeah (Yeah), woo, yeah (Yeah), yeah yeah
Singing yeah (Yeah), woo, yeah (Yeah), woo, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

Thank you

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
And my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, the train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Mister jailеr, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mistеr jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
My mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Oh, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in thе band

Daybreak on the land
Playing
Likе a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you. We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in a couple of minutes, so hang loose

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
Though you make a noise, just can't hear your voice
You're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Bridge]
Why don't you believe what I say is true?
Everything I tell you I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
Heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon, more trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little farther

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Outro]
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Got a letter this morning, baby, and all, all it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, baby, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on in out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
But then again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
He said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
He said, "You can't close the door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's more than ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama came quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

Thank you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows his wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay, hey, hey
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayеd for better weathеr

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, oh, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winnеr take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sorе
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, oh, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You’re gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin’ down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad now)
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don’t wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad now)
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going wherе the climate suits my clothes
Going whеre the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin’ down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad now)
I don’t wanna be treated this a-way

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin’ down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad now, bad now)
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin’ down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad)
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad now)
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Feeling bad now)
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Outro]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
(You know our love will not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our lovely love will not fade away
Our lovely love will not fade away
I say you know our love will not fade away
Said our lovely love will not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away
Thank you all and good night

I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, she went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life

Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back whеre I belong
Listen, and I'm going north to my samе old used-to-be
Listen, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Coal mine)
Coal mine, oh, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, and, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, she's waiting there for me
Hey, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy, I said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Happy home, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not bе there when it rolls ovеr
Though you make a noise, just can't hear your voice
You're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Bridge]
Why don't you believe what I say is true?
Everything I tell you I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
Heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon, more trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little farther

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Outro]
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 1]
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

[Chorus 1]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 2]
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

[Chorus 2]
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well, please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other еyes
On other days while going homе

[Chorus 3]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 4]
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with the words half spoken and thoughts unclear

[Chorus 4]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

[Verse 5]
Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, wind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame

[Outro]
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for thе gun that he wore
My challengе was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger that my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kisses my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh (Yeah), nothing's gonna bring him back (No, no, no, no)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (And he's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (He's gone)
Ooh (Yeah), nothing's gonna bring him back (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (He's gone)
Ooh (Yeah), nothing's gonna bring him back (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
With all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what was that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say, tried to say
Tried to say, tried to say

[Outro]
(There are two colours in my head)

[Verse 1]
There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear a weapon we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games

[Chorus]
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Why don't you quiet down?
Quiet down

[Verse 2]
You don't live in a business world

[?] and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
It's all over the streets tonight
It's all over the streets so let me out of herе
It's all over the streets tonight
It's all over thе streets so let me out of here
All over the

We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah

We're gonna crack your little skull
Crack your little skull

We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, I've had enough
With my blues on down to the gulf
Well, she loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

Thank you

Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Go back home where you belong
Don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

Here's my half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row

Get down, row

Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh, but Jesus loves you the best
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh, but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh, but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down, down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came around and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Get in a circle)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Get in a circle)

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside the lazy country home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows a wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay, hey hey
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we ride on your horses and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
Thought I heard a young man cry today
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 4]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a WIllys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Now, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on and daydream
Sunshine daydream
Coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, come on over sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, ah, ow
Sunshine daydream, ah, ow
Sunshine daydream, ah, ow
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, ow, ow
Sweet lovin' daydream
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music's thundering
We're restless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Just like, just like, like a stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna gеt stranger
Some things we just know

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yеs and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels
Most like we're running a red light
And there ain't no point in looking behind us, no, no

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like, feel like a stranger

[Outro]
You know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show

Feel like a stranger
Just like, just like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Just like, like, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Just like, just like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Crazy night (Crazy night), that's right
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Long, long, crazy night (Crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
Long, long, crazy, crazy night, crazy night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he steppеd to the bar
Drank to the dregs of thе whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
It looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars, you know it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
Must be the same thing keep a drunk out all night

[Verse 2]
What makes all the men want to run a big-legged woman down
What makes all the men want to run a big-legged woman down
Must be the same thing make a bulldog hug a hound

[Bridge]
The same thing
The same thing
Tell me, who's to blame
Whole world, whole world fightin’ about the same thing

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
What makes all the men go crazy when woman wеars her evening gown
What makеs men go crazy when a woman wears her evening gown
Must be the same thing make a preacher lay his Bible down

[Bridge]
Same ol' same thing
Same thing
Tell me, who's to blame
Whole world fightin’, fightin' about that same thing

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
What makes men go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
What makes men go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
Must be the same thing keep a drunk out all night, out all night

[Outro]
It's that ol' same thing
The same thing
Tell me, who's to blame
When the whole world fightin', fightin' about the same thing
Same thing
Tell me, who's to blame
Whole world fightin’, fightin’ about the same, same thing

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She comes running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round, round and round
It don't take much to get me on the ground
She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah)
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights

[Chorus 2]
Round and round, round and round
Don't take much to get me on the ground
Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don't want my love no more
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you've been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 3]
Round and round, round and round
It don't take much to get the word around
She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 4]
I went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love her 'til the day I die

[Chorus 3]
Round and round, round and round
Don't take much to get the word around
I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree where the fruit ain't ripe
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah

[Outro]
Singing yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah yeah
Singing yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 1]
Well, the ragman, he draws circles, up and down the block
I'd ask him, what's the matter, but I know he don't talk
And the ladies, they treat me kindly, and they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart, I know I can't escape
Oh, oh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 2]
Now, Shakespeare he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and bell
Speaking with some French girl, who says shе knows me well
And I would send a mеssage, oh, to find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen, and the mailbox is locked
And oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Mona, she tried to tell me, said, "Stay away from the railroad line"
She says, "All the railroad men, they drink up your blood like wine"
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that
But then again there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids, and he punched my cigarette"
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 4]
Grandpa died last week, and they buried him in the rocks
Now everyone still asks about how badly they are shocked
But me, I expected it to happen, and I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street, yes, and he shot it full of holes
Oh, oh mama, can this really be, really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Now the senator, he came down here, showing everyone his gun
And handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son
Me, I nearly got busted, yes, wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 6]
Now the preacher, he looks so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
I said, "See, not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me, and I hope you're satisfied"
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 7]
The rainman gave me two cures, and he said, "Jump right in"
The first was Texas medicine, the second was just railroad gin
But like a fool I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind
Now people just get uglier, and I have got no sense of time
Oh, oh mama, can this really be, really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 8]
Ruthie says, "Come see me in a honky-tonk lagoon"
Where I can watch her waltz for free and a Panamanian moon
And I said, "Oh, come on now, you know about my debutante"
And she says, "Your debutante knows what you need
But I know what you want"
Oh, oh mama, can this really, really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 9]
The bricks, they lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well timed
And me, I sit here so patiently, trying to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all of these things twice
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Outro]
Hey, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Go back home where you belong
Don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get thеre? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Evеr since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall, rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We'll be back in a bit

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
The sunny side of the street is dark
Maybe it's 'cause it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
You know you got such dark eyes

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Or just over-played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
You think you've seen this town clear through
Nothing here that could interest you
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
When I can hear it beat out loud (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Bridge]
Well, you just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
(Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street)
Don't tell me, don't tell me this town ain't go no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Well, nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, could be the last time
Delilah she sat down on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, she talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
(Look out now)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson, he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
(Great God, talk to me now)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
(That's right)

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections of matter

Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers revolving

Lady in velvet
Recedes in the nights of goodbye

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
There must be some kind of way out of here
Cried the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
And I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
No reason to get excited
The thief kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
This is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
Barefoot servants came and went
Little children too
Outside in the distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approachin'
And the wind began to howl

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And there's just a song, comes crying like the night
Through all the broken dreams and shattered youth

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
Then you hear that song, come crying like the queen
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling oh so bad
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I said, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D. (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need (Good lovin')

Gimme good lovin' (Good lovin')

[Outro]
I need somebody to help me here
Good lovin', got have good lovin'
Good lovin' (Gimme good lovin'), got good lovin'
Got to feel it, got to have it
Everybody everywhere, I don't care, I just don't care
(Got to have lovin') Have lovin'
Give it to me, gimme good lovin'
I want you to give it to me now, gimme good lovin'
They say practice makes perfect now, so give me good lovin'
Hey, gimme good lovin'
Listen, you may weak and you may be blind
Even a blind man knows when the sun is shinin'
He can feel it, feel it
Who needs it now? I wanna know, who needs it now
Good lovin'
Deep down inside you gotta have lovin'
(Gotta have lovin')
You got to feel it (Gotta have lovin'), got to feel it
You got to feel it (Gotta have lovin'), you got to feel it
You got to feel (Gotta have lovin'), you got to feel it
(Gotta have lovin') Feel it, feel it (Gotta have lovin')
Feel it (Gotta have lovin'), feel it (Gotta have good lovin')
Feel it, feel it (Good lovin'), feel it, feel it (Good lovin')
Feel it (Good lovin')

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But they still can't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place, or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste

[Chorus]
There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 2]
Now watch as the ball revolves
And the nighttimе falls
Again the hunt begins
Again the bloodwind calls
By and by, thе morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes
From some men's eyes
No, it strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me

[Chorus]
Oh, click flash blade in ghetto night
Rudy's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge]
Commissars and pin-stripe bosses roll the dice
Any way they roll
Guess who gets to pay the price
Singing money green is the only way
Sell them guns, rape the earth today

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping
Then the flesh is ink
Yes, history's page will be deeply carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
On our own, on our own
On our own, on our own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
If the game is lost
Then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shiny ball of blue we can call our home

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
Politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 5]
Shipping powders back and forth
Yes, and black goes south and white comes north
In a whole world full of petty wars
Yes, and I got mine and you got yours
And the current fashion sets the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
The radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone's got to turn the page
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

[Chorus]
The politicians throwin' stones
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
It's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Outro]
Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinnin', spinnin' free

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day

[Verse 1]
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Bridge]
Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

[Verse 2]
Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

[Outro]
Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, only teenage wasteland
We're all wasted

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
When ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the color of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Outro]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of thе beginning
Of the beginning, of thе beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

[Verse 1]

She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

Ain't gonna be treated this a-way

Well, she went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow

[Verse 1]
I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Just a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard, people, upset in every way

[Verse 2]
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
Watch out, stricken people, the little red rooster is on the prowl

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
If you see my little red rooster, won't you please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster, won't you please, please drivе him home
Been no peace in thе barnyard, people, since my little red rooster's been gone

[Outro]
I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Just a little red rooster, too lazy, lazy to crow for days

[Verse 1]
1948, Christmas Eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee met Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee's a bad man and he shot my Billy D
Bayo, go get him or give the job to me

[Verse 2]
Delia DeLions, oh, sweet Delia D
How the hell could I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive
Not only is that mother big, hе packs a .45
Bayo, Delia said, just give me your gun
Hе shot my Billy dead, and I'm gonna see him hung
She went into the DeLions' club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Stagger Lee lit a cigarette, she shot him in the balls
Pulled on her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead, now he's got to die
Delia went walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could that be?
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that woman sung, "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
The song that woman sung, "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no no, it just couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
So I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
Now, I love them cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, you know the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars, you know it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't no place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't no bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run, run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street
A true man's friend
Well, I turned around, sweet mama, she would swing 'cause
I'm standing on the corner
With a dollar in my hand
I've been looking for a woman
Sweet mama ain't got no man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, sweet and true
The dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
Shе brings me coffee, she brings me tеa
She brings me about every damn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in

We'll be back in a little bit

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Knew she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, Lord, he couldn't believe his mind
Delilah, she climbed up on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, God knows she talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I am having a hard time, living the good life
Don't be that way

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back ('Cause he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing gonna bring him back now)
Ooh (Yeah), nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him, nothing's gonna bring him back)

Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Bridge]
Hear the sea birds cry
There's a ghost wind blowin'
It's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
You'rе a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shorе lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free
Got to pay for being free

[Outro]
Just loose and free and drifting
Drifting and drifting
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling
You really drift your life away
There's no anchor on it, nothing to keep you from drifting away
Ooh, drifting and dreaming, hey
Drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling, hey
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen
You can hear her calling on the wind
Hey hey
Drifting and dreaming, drifting and dreaming, hey
Maybe going on a dream now
Maybe going on a feeling, feeling, feeling

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Walking all morning, been walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
I feel the wind, I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only lovе can fill

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels insidе
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Outro]
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Last station on the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
Oh while I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
And the rain fallin' down now
I never know now
Just don't ever know, no no

[Verse 2]
Got to be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
And if this ain't the real thing
Well, it's close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hеar the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
Whеn the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
Hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose
Hey

I never know, no no
Just don't ever know, oh
Never know, no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
That I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Chorus]
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down now (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down now (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Never know now
Just don't ever know, no no
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
Listen, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
Hey, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe just going on a dream now)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
Hey, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Well, I just don't know, no, honestly)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(I got to go for it for sure now)
Listen, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Got to go, got to go, go, go for sure, hey)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe I'm going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, feeling)

[Verse 1]
Well, my temperature is rising, got my feet on the floor
Crazy people rocking 'cause they wanna go more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy 'cause this place is hot

[Chorus]

Gimme some lovin', gimme gimme some lovin'

She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She takes the dark out of the nighttime
And paints the daytime black

You will start out standing, proud to give her anything she sees
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees
You'll wind up peeking through a key hole, down upon your bended knees

[Instrumental break]

Well, she takes the dark out of the nighttime

She comes walking down my street, then she comes up to my house
Knock upon my door, and then she comes to my room
Hey, and she makes me feel alright, alright
Then after that I can never figure out where my baby went
She might, might have climbed on a space shuttle or gone off and run for president
Don't matter much to me now
'Cause she make me happy as I can be now, that's right

[Outro]
And her name is G-L-O-R-wait a minute

Keep your day job, don't give it away
Keep your day job, 'til your night job pays

Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around now

Sunshine daydream

Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window

1948, Christmas Eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee met Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee's a bad man and he shot my Billy D
Bayo, go get him or give the job to me

[Verse 2]
Delia DeLions, oh, sweet Delia D
How the hell could I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive
Not only is that mother big, hе packs a .45
Bayo, Delia said, just give me your gun
Hе shot my Billy dead, now I'm gonna see him hung
She went into the DeLions' club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Stagger Lee lit a cigarette, she shot him in the balls
Pulled on her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead, and now he's got to die
Delia went walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could that be?
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so very hard
You don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home

[Chorus]
When you something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you say, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"

[Chorus]
You know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 3]
You pay for your ticket
And you go and see the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
Asks you how it feels
To be such a freak
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Bridge]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
Who keep you supplied with facts
When someone attacks your imagination
Anyway they already expect
You to give a check
To a tax-deductible charity organization

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you've discussed
Lepers and crooks
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 5]
Sword swallower comes up to you and
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
Without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here's your throat back
Thanks for the loan"

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 6]
You see this one-eyed midget
And he's shouting the word "NOW"
You say, "What's the matter?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Bridge]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
Who keep you supplied with facts
When somebody attacks your imagination
Anyway they already expect
You to give a check
To a tax-deductible charity organization

[Verse 7]
You walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
With your eyes in your pockets
And your nose on the ground
There oughta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

[Chorus]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Outro]
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to, to the mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom and I ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winnеr take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle start winning; cowboys got sorе
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it just couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love them cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down
With my head in sparkling clover
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, oh oh, to lay me down
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Verse 2]
To lie with you, once more, to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
Let the world go by, like the clouds a-streaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, oh oh, to lay me down
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
To lie with you, once more, to lie with you
With our bodies close together
To wake beside you, my love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies, one last time, and say goodbye

[Chorus]
To lay me down, whoa-oh, to lay me down
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

[Outro]
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, widе and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in thе furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We'll be right back

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
Walk around, walk around, walk

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
Knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
Playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze but you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a living, and we all gotta eat
But you're herе alone, there's no onе to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire, fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holding out for?
Go big in a fall to the floor
The flame from your stage spread to the door
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake
Whoa, oh

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire, fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
Knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Voices tell me what to say
And they tell me where I'll go, yeah, yeah
No, lead the way, them voices tell me so
Tell me so

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurryAnd I'm in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
Knock, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine, shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise up to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
My work fills the sky with flame
Might and glory gonna be my name
People will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
This afternoon, she's in red
I watched the car explode
Still I know I lead the way
Them voices tell me so

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go
Don't worry about me, no
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I said no, no, no
No, no, no
Don't worry about me, no
Ooh, no, no, no
Ooh, no, no, no
Ooh, don't worry about me, don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, no
No, no, the voices know just what to say
Tell me where I'll go
Still I know I lead the way
The voices tell me so
Don't worry about me, no
No, no no, no, no no, no no, no no
No no, no no, no, no no, no, no
No no, no no, no, no, no, no

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine, yes I am
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going whеre the climate suits my clothеs
Going where the climate suits my clothes, yes it does
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
(Don't wanna be treated this a-way now)
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of gentility, nobility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
Every day, believe what you do, yeah
Just one thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
Raise up the spirits in a midnight rendezvous

[Chorus]
'Cause it's real, believe me, well, let me in
Think you can, but you can't run away
Oh, I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
Find her in a sideshow, leave her in L.A
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
'Cause it's real, believe what you did on your land, yeah
One thing more I just got to say
I need a miracle every day, yeah
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing that I just got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Outro]
I need a miracle every day (Every day)
I need a miracle every day (Must have a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle, I need a miracle (Must have a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Yeah, some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Some, some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Yeah, some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

[Verse]
Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune
Something to keep us all feel happy
Do anything to take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who makes us all laugh
But doing that, you break down in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on outside
Sunshine daydream, comin', comin' from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, Wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
We're going, we're going where the wind goes
We're living on the inside
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Oh, comin' from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, ah, comin', comin', comin', ah
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream, ah

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, ah, come on over daydream
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream, ah
Sunshine daydream, ah
Sweet lovin' daydream
Come on over daydream

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
It ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, oh, and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues
Drink your health, share your wealth
I'll run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Thank you, good night

[Verse]
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Oh, I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm on my way
Well, I'm on my way
Home sweet home, yeah
Well, I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
Don't tell me not to live
Just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's
A ball of butter
Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?

Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?

I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it
But whether I'm the rose
Of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose
Of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye

I gotta fly once
I've gotta try once
Only can die once, right, sir?

Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy, and you'll see
I've gotta have my bite, sir

Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a "comer"
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?

I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want, I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw, that bell will go clang
Eye on the target, and wham
One shot, one gun shot, and bam!
Hey, Mister Arnstein, here I am!

I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir
I guess I didn't make it

Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a "comer,"
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
No, nobody, no, nobody
Is gonna rain on my parade!

[Verse 1]
Wow, there is somethin' goin' down
Like the storm in the sky
I ain't gonna be played by your behavior
How can I trust someone who's lyin' to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, bow out, go
Now, I said, bow out and leave
I said take your stuff, and go
'Cause you're not for me, no

[Chorus]
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, mamma knows best when, yes, I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my heels on the ground

[Verse 2]
See, I ain't no new old rag doll that you can pick up and drop
And all of this inconsistent love, yeah
I think it's time that it S-T-O, stops

[Pre-Chorus]
So, bow out, go
Now, I said, bow out and leave
I said take your stuff, and go
'Cause you're not for me, no

[Chorus]
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, mamma knows best when, yes, I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my heels on the ground

[Bridge]
"Just be the best," my daddy said to me
"Always use humor as your therapy, yeah
Never take life too seriously
Just do you, 'cause you do you so perfectly"

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best

[Chorus]
See, mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, mamma knows best when, yes, I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my heels on the ground

[Outro]
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See, mamma, mamma knows
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See, mamma, mamma knows best
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talkin' loud, not sayin' much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bulletproof, nothin' to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus]
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Verse 2]
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talkin' loud, but not sayin' much

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm bulletproof, nothin' to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus]
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Bridge]
Stone heart, machine gun
Fired at the ones who run
Stonе heart, as I'm bulletproof glass

[Chorus]
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot mе down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

[Verse 1]
When I had you
I treated you bad
And wrong, my dear
And since
Since you went away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Verse 2]
I, I, I, I
Should have never
Ever made you cry
And since
Since you've been gone

[Chorus]
Then, don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Bridge]
Life without love
Is oh, so lonely
I don't think, I don't think
I can make it
All my life, all my life
Goes to you only
Come on and take it, girl
Come on and take it, because

[Verse 3]
All
All I can do, all I can do
Since you've been gone is cry
And you, ooh
Don't you ever wonder your pretty little hеad
About what I do

[Chorus]
Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

[Outro]
I, I, I wonder
Who, who, who's lovin' you
I, I, I wondеr
Who, who, who's lovin' you

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wonderin' if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say the time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can ya hear me?
I'm in California dreamin' about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference bеtween us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
So hello from the othеr side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breakin' your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothin' ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breakin' your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the outside
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breakin' your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 1]
... my parade
And all the clubs you get in usin' my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you that should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's goin' on
But now I know, I'm better sleepin' on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
Tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think that you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's goin' on
But now I know, I'm better sleepin' on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
And I didn't—'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
You're so very special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
Yeah, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
No, I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
Oh, woah-woah
You're so very special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong, belong, belong
Oh, woah

[Bridge]
She's runnin' out again
She's runnin' out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
Woo-ooh, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice

[Chorus]
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do, do, oh

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out, threw a feast
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, one thing's for sure
Baby, I've got mine, but you'll get all yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Oh, Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do

[Outro]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules, unbreakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not buying
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules, an unbreakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I'd scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks so pretty like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules, an unbreakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse]
Before you go and make that face that you make
When you're mad at me, so mad at me
Let me say it's not my place goin' through your voicemail
And your search history
Oh, and if this were a TV show
You know I'd have to go and plead insanity
'Cause the lyin' and spyin'
It's really not my personality, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, this is my fault, my bad
And I've said a million sorrys
How about a billion sorrys?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You shine just like the stars
And I'm not even a night light
'Cause what I did wasn't so bright
I'm really, I'm really—

[Outro]
This is my fault, my bad
And I've said a million sorrys
How about a billion sorrys?
You shine just like the stars
And I'm not even a night light
'Cause what I did wasn't so bright
I'm really sorry

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
She can't hide, no matter how hard she tries (She can't hide, no matter how hard she tries)
Her secret disguise behind the lies
And at night, she cries (cries) away her pride (cries) (pride)
With eyes shut tight, staring at her insides (staring at her insides)
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night (Ahh)
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Shе can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool hеrself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(You're too weak to face me!) She can only fool herself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he can't hold the reigns
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(You're too weak to face me!) He can only fool himself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Just follow me
I never know just why you run
And I'll show you what you want to see
Just follow me
So far away, far away from me
And I'll show you what you want to see

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Every day reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can’t live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut out of my soul and just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low, 'cause it’s part of me
You'll hardly see, right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the routine scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
So tired of making the same mistakes again and again
The suffering just won't end
And I can't let myself be
The man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what’s killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I’m in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it)
Once it’s been dealt with, you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melt it down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Take you to the depths at the bottom of the well
And then you know that you can choose to lose
The part of your heart where your inside’s bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Alive in me, inside of me
A part turns grey and rocks away silently
Alive in me, inside of me
A part turns grey and rocks away silently
(This part of me won't go away)
Alive in me, inside of me
A part turns grey and rocks away silently
(Part of me won't go away)
Alive in me, inside of me
A part turns grey and rocks away silently

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Every day reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Want to cut it out of my soul and just live with a gaping hole
Pride myself and taking control of the situation
Responsible for it's creation
Hang my head low cause it's part of me
You hardly see, right here in the heart of me
Hurting me, the roots old scar
New cuts over where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I'd rather not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Eradicate the paid pollution
Feel the rein of resolution
But then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Take you to the depths of the bottom of the well
So you know that you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your inside's bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free
Willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
This part of me won't go away
Part of me won't go away

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it everyday
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it everyday
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Verse 1]
City of love
City of lies
You get what you give
And I won't give it twice
So here I am now
Three seats to myself
And out the plane window
It looks like a quilt

[Chorus]
And you're pulling in to work
I know you're always right on time
And it's strange how it still hurts
Even on the other side
But I won't be gone for too long
I'm in Paris for a song

[Verse 2]
City of love
Be good to me
My weary heart
And my aching feet
Coffee alone
And a paper I can’t read
On the Champs-Élysées
You should be here with me

[Chorus 2]
But you're driving in the dark
Down Highway 65
And I'm sorry that we fight
Baby, let’s make up somеtime
'Cause I won't be gonе for too long
I'm in Paris for a song

[Instrumental break]

[Reprise]
Here on the other side
In my hand’s my guitar
The people smile and clap their hands
Singin' about you is still hard

[Outro]
But I won't be gone for too long
I'm in Paris for this song

[Verse 1]
She was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm lettin' go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel"

[Verse 2]
It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I have been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight"

[Chorus]
"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm lettin' go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel"
"Oh, I'm lettin' go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me"

[Outro]
Oh, woah, ooh

[Verse 1]
There ain't no reason you and me can't be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
Night, yeah, baby
And I've got a reason that you should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it's right when it's wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Night, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edgе
The edge, thе edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

[Verse 2]
Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
Night, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of somethin' final we call life, tonight
Put on your shades, 'cause I'll be dancin' in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Night, yeah, baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

[Chorus]
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness

[Verse 1]
I'm in a parked car, on a crowded street
You see your love made complete
The thread is ripping, the knot is slippin'
Blindness

[Verse 2]
Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness

[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Love is blindness

[Bridge]
A little death without mournin'
No call and no warnin'
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense

[Verse 3]
Love is drownin' in a deep well
All the secrets, and nobody else to tell
Take the money
Why don't ya, honey?
Blindness

[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I'm so sick of it
Why don't you take the night
And wrap it all around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
Love is blindness
Ooh, I'm too numb to feel
Blow out the candle
Blindness

[Verse 1]
Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABCs we all must face
To try to win an embrace

[Verse 3]
The rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 4]
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright
Oh well, a touch of grey kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Outro]
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on in out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, I gave him a gun
But then again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
He said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close thе door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
He said, "You can't closе the door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished his bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
It's more than ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama came quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free
And free all the ladies in the area-O

[Verse 3]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, your citiеs I will burn
Destroy all the peoplе in the area-O

[Verse 4]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 5]
What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mother think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O

[Verse 7]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 8]
Sweet William he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Outro]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy and he wants to shine my feet
Three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
Instead I've got a bottle and a girl that's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
Well, she said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room, whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause drinkin' and thinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
And I'd have no one but myself to blame
Went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And now I'm spending my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across the desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
When I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, pray for rain
Got a head full of ideas, that are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way they makes me scrub the floor
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Hands you a nickel, hands you a dime
Asks you with a grin if you're having a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
He puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
But his bedroom window is made out of sticks
And the National Guard stands outside the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Ah, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight but says she's twenty-four
Man, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Do my very best to be just who I am
But everybody wants me to be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

[Verse 1]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la...

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la

[Verse 4]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a littlе while
And then flew on

[Outro]
Tеll me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain
Snow and rain
Snow and rain
Snow and rain

We'll be back in just a little bit

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
Knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening when the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matchеs and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
Playin' cold music on the barroom floor
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze but you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a living, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compеte
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
Morе than just ashes when your dreams come true
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holding out for?
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
The flame from your stage has spread to the door
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more that you take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place, or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste

[Refrain]
There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 2]
Now watch as the ball revolves
And the nighttimе falls
Again the hunt begins
Again the bloodwind calls
By and by, thе morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes
From some men's eyes
No, it strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me

[Refrain]
Oh, click flash blade in ghetto night
Rudy's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge]
Commissars and pin-stripe bosses roll the dice
Any way they fall
Guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

[Refrain]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
The politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping
Then the flesh is ink
History's page will be deeply carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own
We are on our own
On our own
We are on our own
On our own
On our own
On our own, on our own
On our own, on our own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
If the game is lost
Then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shiny ball of blue we can call our home

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
Politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 1]
My spy dog see your spy dog sittin' by the fire
My spy dog say your spy dog: "Gonna set your thing on fire"

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout hey now (Hey now), hey now (Hey now)
Iko, Iko, un-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Indian boy wanna go downtown (Iko, Iko, un-day)
Said if you don't like what the big chief say, say (Jock-a-mo fee na-né)

[Chorus]
Hey now (Hey now), hey now (Hey now)

Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

Everybody say hey now (Hеy now), hey now (Hey now)

Talkin' 'bout hey now (Hеy now), hey now (Hey now)
Iko, Iko, un-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

[Verse 1]
There must be some kind of way out of here
Cried the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
And I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
No reason to get excited
The thief kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
This is not our fate
Let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
Barefoot servants came and went
Little children too
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approachin'
And the wind began to howl

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Standing on the moon
I got no cobweb on my shoe
Standing on the moon
I'm feeling so alone and blue
I see the Gulf of Mexico
As tiny as a tear
The coast of California
Must be somewhere over here, over here

[Verse 2]
Standing on the moon
I see the battle rage below
Standing on the moon
I see the soldiers come and go
There’s a metal flag beside me
Someone planted long ago
Old Glory standing stiffly
Crimson, white and indigo
Old Glory standing stiffly
Crimson, white and indigo
Indigo

[Bridge]
I see all of Southeast Asia
I can see El Salvador
I hear thе cries of children
And the othеr songs of war
It's like a mighty melody
That rings down from the sky
Standing here upon the moon
I watch it all roll by, all roll by
All roll by, all roll by

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on the moon
I see a shadow on the sun
Standing on the moon
The stars go fading one by one
I hear a cry of victory
Another of defeat
A scrap of age-old lullaby
Down some forgotten street

[Verse 4]
Standing on the moon
Where talk is cheap and vision true
Standing on the moon
But I would rather be with you
Somewhere in San Francisco
On a back porch in July
Just looking up to heaven
At this crescent in the sky, in the sky

[Outro]
Standing on the moon
With nothing left to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you
A lovely view of heaven
But I’d rather be with you, be with you
Be with you, I'd rather be with you
Be with you, I'd rather be with you
Be with you, be with you
Be with you, be, be with you
Rather be with you, I'd rather be with you
Be with you, be with you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone

Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Well, ain't nothing gonna bring him back)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (He's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (He's gone)
Ooh (Yeah), nothing's gonna bring him back (He's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Got to get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
Every day, believe what you do, yeah
Just one thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations with a candle burning blue
Raise up the spirits in a midnight rendezvous

[Chorus]
'Cause it's real, believe me, well, let me in
Can't get around it and you can't run away
I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
Find her in a sideshow, leave her in L.A
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
It's real, believe me today, oh yeah
One more thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing that I just got to say
(I need a miracle every day)

[Outro]
I need a miracle every day (Every day)
I need a miracle every day (Must have a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (Some kind of miracle)
I need a miracle, I need a miracle (I need a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (I need a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (I need a miracle)
I need a miracle every day (I need a miracle)
I need a miracle, I need a miracle

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe thеm
Half of my life
I spent doing time for somе other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 4]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
If the game is lost
Then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shiny ball of blue we can call our home

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
The politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Shipping powders back and forth
Yes, and black goes south and white comes north
In a whole world full of petty wars
Yes, and I got mine and you got yours
And the current fashion sets the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
The radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone's got to turn the page
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

[Chorus]
The politicians throwin' stones
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
'Cause it's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Outro]
Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinnin', spinnin' free
Dizzy with eternity

I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You’re gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
Sing lullabies bеside the water
Mama, Mama, many worlds I'vе come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 3]
I'm going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Outro]
I'm gonna listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And there's still that song, comes crying like the wind
Down every lonеly street there's evеr been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
Then you hear that song, come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would all stop and say
"My, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go go on, Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from all miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Seeing Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go go on, Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go go on, Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Outro]
Let that dog out. This is an integral part of our show. Pass one around, diddle diddle

[Lyrics from snippet]
Dick in her mouth like a Tomb
Beat it up till it get numb
She trynna swallow my sons
I be to high, I don't know what I'm on
Super Saiyan, I done went Goku
Diamond tooth candy like fruity loop
Stick to the play and got more loop
Stars

[Lyrics from snippet]
I'm in my bag aye
I just been poppin these tags, aye

[?]
That's my friend aye I just went and copped him a Jag, aye
That's my bitch aye I just bought her some ass, aye
Look at my wrist, aye, ice age

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse 2]
I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you

[Verse 3]
What's to be found, racing around
You're carrying your bag wherever you go
I'm full of blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
Turn it around, that's what I'm gonna do
Going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh, turn it around, that's what I'm gonna do
Guess I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Thank you
We got an equipment malfunction, which is to say everything is going as usual. Any minute now

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; hey, you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down and just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time and Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing near every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to thе California sun
Bobby shared the secrеts of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lalala, lalala

[Outro]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzy)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Got no chance of losing this time
Got no chance of losing this time

This next one is dedicated to the great state of Tijuana

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
Three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room, whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it al
