Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus: OMI & Nicky Jam]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Bridge: EMI & Nicky Jam]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah, yeah
Ella se suelta, en verdad tiene gana' 'e bailar
No le importa que la miren, 'ta loca conmigo

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
La miro sin parar, ya no puedo disimular
Todo lo que a mí me gusta
Esa cara, ese pelo, me tiene mal
Y no quiero irme sin llevármela
Sin importarme lo que piensen o lo que dirán
You've got me, mmm-mmm
Nadie como lo tú lo hace
I want you, mmm-mmm
Nobody can move it like you do it

[Chorus: OMI]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Bridge: Nicky Jam]
I wanna see the morning light
But I need you by my side
Girl, you make me feel so right
When i'm with you I'm alive I'm alive
When i'm with you I'm alive I'm alive

[Verse 3: OMI]
Hmm, she gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention?
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus: OMI]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 1]
Hey you, don't you give up
It's not so bad
There's still a chance for us
Hey you, just be yourself
Don't be so shy
There's reasons why it's hard

[Chorus]
Keep it together, you'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, what ending would we do?
This could be good, hey you

[Verse 2]
Hey you, open your heart
It's not so strange
You’ve got to change this time
Hey you, remember this
None of it's real, including the way you feel

[Chorus]
Keep it together, we'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, will envy what we do
This could be good, hey you

[Post-Chorus]
Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, little brother
Hey you, save yourself
Don't rely on anyone else

[Bridge]
First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first

[Verse 3]
Hey you, there on the fence
You've got a choice
One day it will make sense
Hey you, first love yourself
Or if you can't
Try to love someone else

[Chorus]
Keep it together, we'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, will envy what we do
This could be good, hey you

[Bridge]
First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first

[Verse 1: Madonna]
No pain, no gain
That's what all the people say
Pick up all the damaged parts
I won't be so broken-hearted

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
You are not the one for me
History has made me see
Nothing's wrong, I'm okay
Was bound to happen anyway
I'm movin' on
No regrets and I'm not sorry

[Chorus: Madonna]
The feeling so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Don't ask, don't tell
Didn't really serve us well
You always did the unexpected
Trouble is I can't forget it

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
People do what they want
Keep it up until they're gone
Looking for the easy way
Never think they have to pay
Appreciate what you have before you lose it

[Chorus: Madonna]
The feeling so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge: Madonna]
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Are you listening?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
You are not the one for me
History has made me see
Nothing's wrong, I'm okay
Was bound to happen anyway
I'm movin' on
No regrets and I'm not sorry

[Bridge: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
What do you want me to do? (What do you want her to do?)
I'm willing to say that I forgive you
That which i cannot accept (Why can't you accept?)
No regrets and I'm not sorry (But you know you are)

[Chorus: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
The feeling so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway (You know you are)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an еmpty room full of empty space
Like thе empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your dog
If I thought it might keep me by your side
If you go away, if you go away
Please don't go away
If you forget me
I want you to know one thing
You know how this is
If I look  at the crystal moon
At the red branch  of the slow autumn at my window,
if I touch near the fire, the impalpable ash
Or the wrinkled body of the log
everything carries me to you
As if everything that exists
Aromas, light, metals
We're little boats that sail
Toward those isles of yours that wait for me
Well, now
If little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you, little by little.
If suddenly you forget me
Do not look for me
For I shall already have forgotten you.
If you think it long and mad
Thе wind of banners  that passes through my life,
And you dеcide
To leave me at the shore  of the heart where I have roots
Remember, that on that day, at that hour
I shall lift my arms  and my roots will set off  to seek another land.
But  if each day, each hour
You feel that you are destined for me with implacable sweetness
if each day a flower  climbs up to your lips to seek me
Ah, my love, ah, my own
In me, all that fire is repeated
In me, nothing is extinguished or forgotten
My love feeds on your love, beloved
And as long as you live, it will be in your arms
without leaving mine

[Verse 1]
Just take me with all my stupid flaws
Changing means like shooting in the dark
Patience, please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to
Be-lieve me, I want it just as bad
Forgive me, wish I could change the past
Take it, 'cause, I'll never be as perfect as you want

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

[Chorus]
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you thе way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
With all my bеautiful scars
Love me with all of my flaws
My beautiful scars

[Verse 2]
Don't judge me, just gotta let me be
Accept me, although I'm incomplete
My im-per-fections make me unique, that's my belief

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

[Chorus]
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
With all my beautiful scars
Love me with all of my flaws
My beautiful scars

[Bridge]
Never say never, anything is possible
Always been a rebel, overcoming obstacles
I can't give you perfect, but I can give you forever
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I think they're beautiful
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
With all my beautiful scars
Love me with all of my flaws
My beautiful scars

[Outro]
My beautiful scars
My beautiful scars

[Verse 1]
I tried to change, but I couldn't help myself
I am to blame, I used to be someone else
No one got through, nothing came inside the gate
You made me feel when my heart was set on hate

[Pre-Chorus]
I convinced myself that I was invincible
But I didn't know that feelings can lie too
You exposed my deepest wound, but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

[Chorus]
Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl

[Verse 2]
You were so good at pretending that you care
I was alone, even with you standing there
You made me doubt everyone that cared for me
I shut them out so that you'd be all I see

[Pre-Chorus]
I convinced myself that I was invincible
But I didn't know that feelings can lie too
You exposed my deepest wound, but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

[Chorus]
Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl
Every time you say good-bye
It feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry
I feel like the most tragic girl

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yes, I am, yes, I will
I'm the one, I can still
Overcome, and embrace
All this, misery and hate

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me by the hand, lead me down the road
Loosen my grip and lighten my load
Help me take the path less traveled by
Help me understand all the reasons why

[Chorus]
Dear father, forgive me
I don't know what I've done
Dear father, please guide and protect me
I'll return when my battle is won
Dear father

[Verse 2]
Yes, you are, yes you will
You're the one, with me still
Give me strength, to undo
All the, hurting people do

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me by the hand, lead me down the road
Loosen my grip and lighten my load
Help me take the path less traveled by
Help me understand all the reasons why

[Chorus]
Dear father, forgive me
I don't know what I've done
Dear father, please guide and protect me
I'll return when my battle is won

[Bridge]
Without your help, dear father
Without your help, dear father
Without your help, dear father
Without your help, dear father
Without your help, dear father
Without your help, dear father
Without your help, dear father
I would be all alone
In the dark
No one to comfort me
Who listens to my heart

[PreChorus]
Take me by the hand, lead me down the road
Loosen my grip and lighten my load
Help me take the path less traveled by
Help me understand all the reasons why

[Chorus]
Dear father, forgive me
I don't know what I've done
Dear father, please guide and protect me
I'll return when my battle is won
Dear father, forgive me
I don't know what I've done
Dear father, please guide and protect me
I'll return when my battle is won

[Outro]
Without your help, dear father

[Verse 1]
In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my sеcret garden, therе's

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Verse 2]
If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by?
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Verse 3]
I still believe, I still believe
Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Outro]
Somewhere in Fontainebleau
Lies my secret garden

[Verse: bearface & Dijon]
Angela, I can't lie to you
So help me now, help me now
With the bottles of your fume
It's all you know (Ooh)
It's all you know (It's all you, It's all you know)
But let me come around, baby
Swoon you, fall to the floor (Yeah)
What do you need now? (Ooh)
I'll be on my way back, baby
Your soul

[Refrain: bearface]
I'll be there, no
It's your light
It's your light
It's your light
It's all for you (You love it)
You come, you're leaving

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah

[Verse 1]
I’ve been a thousand miles in my daydream
Gown girl I jump right over the sun
Got a Hercules and James brown baby
We woke up everyone
Cause your skirt short, but your thoughts deep
You, you, you just want everyone to want you
Oh, you just want part of the fun

[Chorus]
Hold on tight to your roses baby, they’re not for everyone
Can’t keep giving out roses baby, that makes you everyone
Things I wish my granny said (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Things I wish my mother said (Oh, we, oh)
Things I wish my sister said (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Things I wish somebody said to me, to me, to me, to me, to me

[open verse]

[Chorus]
Hold on tight to your roses baby, they’re not for evеryone
Can’t keep giving out roses baby, that makes you еveryone
Things I wish my granny said (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Things I wish my mother said (Oh, we, oh)
The things I wish my sister said (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Things I wish somebody said to me, to me, to me, to me, to me

[open verse]

[Chorus]
Hold on tight to your roses baby, they’re not for everyone
Can’t keep giving out roses baby, that makes you everyone
Things I wish my granny said (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Things I wish my mother said (Oh, we, oh)
The things I wish my sister said (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah)
Things I wish somebody said to me, to me, to me, to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

[Chorus]
Dandelion
A million little wishes
Blow across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

[Verse 2]
Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinkin' it could change my world

[Chorus]
Dandelion
A million little wishes
Blow across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

[Bridge]
Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

[Chorus]
(Oh) Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses
Out across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion
Dandelion

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round

[Outro]
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Three times a pain
Run across your brain

[Verse 4]
Over yonder, stands a mother
Sending clothes to her son by the war
I said "I'm her lover, baby
And we don't even try to fight the war
So shoot your bullets up a while and call me, baby
Of matter fact, you can shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot some more

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Ooh ooh...

[Verse 5]
Well I pick up an axe sometimes, and fight like a farmer
And you shoot me down, right back in the ground
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
Put me right back down in the earth I was workin' on
Don't you shoot me down
Don't you shoot me down
The same way you shoot me down, baby

[?] always just upset

[?] bad
Shoot me down

[Guitar Outro]

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, they don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me! Help me!
Ah no, no

[Instrumental - Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

[Outro]
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze

[Verse 1]
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!

[Chorus]
Show me that I'm done
I'm finished here, but still no fear, yeah
Ain't no more reminiscin'
Ain't no more judgin', no intuition
Tell me why I'm livin'
Why am I remaining here?
I was smokin' 'Scotti, but not Pippen
I taught my son how to stack that shit to the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Drop a body and you wouldn't have to pay for lunch
I told my dawg I'm ridin' whether he right or wrong
I done got big, they record my life through a drone
I told my bitch to stay behind me, I'm in my zone
She like, "How the fuck you ain't never wrote a song?"
Same reason your fine ass ain't never wore a thong
You ain't ridin' for life, then I'd just rather ride alone
Bought you a spot, now you don't ever gotta go
Yeah, I told my nigga I'ma drop the jewels on him
You gotta go through this shit here with your heart, you can't snooze on it
It's bad, you better get rid of it or lose on it
I know you heard that old saying about bad fruit, homie, huh
If you can't beat 'em, knock it out 'em, whew
If you gon' kill 'em, better not be sloppy
I told my daughter, "Keep one in the head," she ain't gotta cock it
I told my son if he wanted to live, he might catch a body
I told my son he ain't a cheerleader, but he might gotta catch a body
His driver named Joe, but he still can't do it sloppy
I just hopped up out that Ghost, I been drivin' a dead body
I ain't really into nothin', but I spend it like a hobby
I was locked inside the trap, didn't think about it, but I got out it
Now my cars and clothes exotic
I ain't 6ix9ine, but two hoes with me right now, you can call me Shotti
I been droppin' all my vic's and now the FBI won't stop me
Got this shit on fire like a Taki, nigga, woah, woah

[Chorus]
Show me that I'm done
I'm finished here, but still no fear, yeah
Ain't no more reminiscin'
Ain't no more judgin', no intuition
Tell me why I'm livin'
Why am I remaining here?
I was smokin' 'Scotti, but not Pippen
I taught my son how to stack that shit to the ceiling

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they complimentin' my new Rolls-Royce

Spirit of ecstasy got me feelin' so blessed, you see
I told my bitch I was 'bout to go shoot up Trestletree
Half a million dollars on my dawgs and all my cars
Couple millions to my mama and my pa
Got the sniper on the roof for niggas tryna act hard
I just bought a brand new coupe and it's a black Jaguar
Matte black, old Trans Am, thank you, ma'am
We gon' make us a porn star video, new cam
I came up just watchin' my pop gamble my food stamps

Baby, we stamped, just for that, I'ma call you "Ma'am"
Got the T-Rex, I just gave my daddy the Cam

Pick that lil' bitch up, then I slam her like I'm from D-X
Then I fold her up like a clam, yeah

I don't know how to make it right, right
Bought four Birkins for you, keep it light, light
I don't care about you leavin' me
I got no time to try to make it right
I just hope you find another life
Won't pick you up if you ever fall, right? (Woah, woah, woah)

[Chorus]
Show me that I'm done
I'm finished here, but still no fear, yeah
Ain't no more reminiscin'
Ain't no more judgin', no intuition
Tell me why I'm livin'
Why am I remaining here?
I was smokin' 'Scotti, but not Pippen
I taught my son how to stack that shit to the ceiling

How to Launch an Artificial Intelligence Venture Without Using Proprietary Data
I learnt about the billions of dollars banks lose each year to credit card theft a few years ago. Improved fraud detection and prediction would be extremely beneficial. As a result, I examined the potential of persuading a bank to provide transactional data in order to develop a more accurate fraud detection system. Unsurprisingly, no big bank is ready to give such information. They believe that recruiting a team of data scientists to work on the problem internally is a superior option. My startup idea met an untimely demise

Despite the immense innovation and entrepreneurial prospects associated with AI, entrepreneurs often confront a chicken-and-egg conundrum before they even begin, which established businesses are less likely to face. I believe that certain tactics can assist entrepreneurs in overcoming this obstacle and establishing successful AI-driven enterprises

What is the chicken-and-egg challenge in the field of artificial intelligence entrepreneurship?

Today's AI systems require training on massive datasets, which might be difficult for entrepreneurs. Established businesses with a substantial consumer base already have a steady stream of data from which to train AI systems, create new products and enhance current ones, generate extra data, and so on (for example, Google Maps has over 1B monthly active users and over 20 Petabytes of data). However, for entrepreneurs, the requirement for data creates a chicken-and-egg situation: because their firm has not yet been formed, they lack data, which means they cannot simply construct an AI product

Additionally, data is not just required to get started with AI; it is critical to the performance of the AI. While algorithms are important, data is more important, according to research. The performance differences between the algorithms used in modern machine learning are quite minimal when compared to the performance differences between the same algorithms used with more or less data (Banko and Brill 2001)

Numerous solutions exist to assist entrepreneurs in navigating this chicken-and-egg challenge and gaining access to the data necessary to break into the AI industry

While algorithms are important, data is more important, according to research

Five strategies for resolving the chicken-and-egg conundrum



Begin by providing a service that is valuable even without AI and generates data
While data must precede an AI product, data does not have to precede all products. Entrepreneurs can begin by developing a service that is not focused on artificial intelligence but rather on solving consumer problems and generating data in the process. This data can then be utilised to train an artificial intelligence system that improves the existing service or builds a new one

For instance, while Facebook did not use AI in its early years, it continued to deliver a social networking platform that customers desired. Facebook gathered a vast quantity of data in the process, which was then used to train AI systems that helped customise the newsfeed and also enabled the delivery of incredibly targeted advertisements. Despite its origins as a non-AI-driven service, Facebook has become a big consumer of AI

Similarly, Lemonade, an InsurTech startup, initially lacked the data necessary to develop powerful AI capabilities. However, Lemonade has developed AI capabilities to generate quotations, process claims, and detect fraud over time. Today, its AI system handles the "initial notice of loss" for 96 percent of claims and conducts the entire claim settlement process in a third of situations without human intervention. These AI skills have been developed over the course of several years of operations

2. Form a partnership with a non-tech organisation that has a proprietary dataset

Entrepreneurs can collaborate with a firm or organisation that possesses a proprietary dataset but lacks in-house artificial intelligence competence. This method is especially advantageous in circumstances where it would be extremely difficult to establish a product that provides the type of data required by your AI application, such as medical data concerning patient testing and diagnosis. In this situation, you might collaborate with a hospital or an insurance provider to collect anonymised data

A related concern is that the data used to train your AI product could come from a prospective consumer. While this is more difficult in highly regulated businesses such as healthcare and banking, clients in other sectors such as manufacturing may be more receptive. All you may need to offer in exchange is a few months of exclusive access to the AI product or early access to upcoming product enhancements

A disadvantage of this strategy is that potential partners may prefer to engage with established corporations rather than with smaller, less well-known, and trustworthy players (especially in a post- GDPR and Cambridge Analytica world). Thus, while business development will be challenging, this technique is nevertheless achievable, particularly when well-known technology businesses are not already pursuing your target partner

Entrepreneurs who are family business members may already have access to a sizable amount of data from their existing firm. That is also an excellent alternative

3. Crowdsource the required (labelled) data

Entrepreneurs can collect data through crowdsourcing, depending on the type of data required. When data is available but poorly labelled (for example, photographs on the Internet), crowdsourcing can be an especially effective method of collecting it, as labelling is a task that lends itself well to being completed quickly by a large number of users using crowdsourcing platforms. Amazon Mechanical Turk and Scale.ai are widely utilised to assist in the generation of labelled training data

Consider Google's use of Captchas as an example. While they are critical for security, they are also used by Google as a crowdsourced image categorization system. Each day, "millions of people contribute to Google Analytics' pre-processing team, which validates machine learning algorithms for free."

Certain products provide workflows that enable customers to assist with the labelling of fresh data while using the product. Indeed, the entire discipline of Active Learning is devoted to figuring out how to query users interactively in order to improve the labelling of incoming data points. Consider a cybersecurity product that generates risk alerts and a workflow in which an operations engineer resolves those alerts, resulting in the generation of new labelled data. Similarly, product recommendation sites such as Pandora use upvotes and downvotes to determine the accuracy of their recommendations. In both of these scenarios, you can begin with an MVP that evolves over time in response to consumer input

[Verse 1]
I'm seeing brake lights
That means he's leaving me again
But this is like the eighth time
I guess I'll see him in the morning
'Cause he'll come back, he always does
And then we fight and then we fuss again
Back to the beginning

[Chorus]
But we seem to make up every time (Every time)
But when we don't break up, the fault is mine (Fault is mine)
But before we fall out again, there's something you should know
I hate to see you lеave, but I love, to watch you go (Go, go)
Love to watch you go (Go, go)

[Verse 2]
I'm seeing daylight
And I'm still alonе in my bed
Something ain't right
So should I go to him instead?
I messed up this time, I always do
And then we fight and then we're through again
Back to the beginning

[Chorus]
But we seem to make up every time (Every time)
But when we don't break up, the fault is mine (Fault is mine)
But before we fall out again, there's something you should know
I hate to see you leave, but I love, to watch you go (Go, go)
Love to watch you go (Go, go)

[Bridge]
Who's gonna help me save us?
He made us, one again
Will he take me back this time?
After what I did
He has no idea
Why he should spend one more night here
It's over, again, again

[Chorus]
But we seem to make up every time (Every time)
But when we don't break up, the fault is mine (Fault is mine)
But before we fall out again
There's something you should know
I hate to see you leave, but

We like to do a thing that's of what's happening today with a lot of people
And I'd like to dedicate to all the guests that have shown a struggle that are gonna make it anyway
That's one thing for sure, it's a hard time in that song
It's a thing called "I Don't Live Today, Maybe Tomorrow, I Can't Say"
But I don't live today

No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry and execute me, now
So I can be on my miserable way

Well
I don't
Live today
Maybе tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh

Live today

And whereever
Places where public saxophones are employed

Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain

Thy power throughout the universe displayed

[Refrain]
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway And put some feel good in my soul

Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

But the wind got in my way I changed my course but my definition of change
Just ain't the same I'm gonna sit right here, stay away from there

Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

Dig down deep, strike my stash Light it up, memory crash

Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke Gon' drink a little drink, smoke a little
Smokes yeah

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you

And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

America, what the fuck?
Ain't it hilarious? Runaway chariot
Shy of a half a billion guns
(Who you with?)
Me? I'm with Jesus

Is it something in the water?
'Cause it's a me, myself, and dollar hell
(Ain't that freedom sweet?)
Sounds pretty freaky to me

What do you mean, buddy? Freedom rings

Is it something in the water?
'Cause it's a me, myself, and dollar hell

With everything we know, what did we suppose
Was gonna happen to us? Got the plastic blues
And all the green's skimmed off the top

(Who you with?)
Me? I'm with reason
Is it something in the water?
'Cause it's a me, myself, and dollar hell
Ain't that freedom sweet?

[Verse 1]
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know wе weren't perfеct
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
Oh-ooh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause you know I still love you, babe
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But you know I still love you, babe

[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Outro]
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Are you ready? Ready to do something you never did before

[Chorus: T-Pain]

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Came to light on a very hot day
The grass was sweating
You were sleeping in
With the window open
The blanket breathing
Cigarette on a golden ashtray
Your golden hair lay
In the swollen sunray
The withered roses hanging in the doorway

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be right
Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna pretend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
Heavy bend

[Verse 2]
Second sight and the clouds above you
As the wilderness grew thickеr and the crow flew
Tossing and turning, your forehеad burning

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be right
Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna defend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
From the empty height
Flies on the ceiling now
I wanna hold you tight
Don't wanna pretend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
Heavy bend
Heavy bend

[Verse]
Moving Benzs with 8 Vs
They think crucifixes in vests is a safe tees
That work for hexes and chest hits
But if your head is on the hecklers setlist
Then you on some heckle the set shit
Blesses to the exorcist Xs
Understand that you messing with precious
I put your privilege in a jam, like eggs are the exits
I preface breakfast with prayer, end a dinner with death wish
Wake up with no regrеts, they sit us in for the seconds
Ugh, cool watch
Divе bars, do 'em so smooth, ain't no movement on pool tops
Take bass out of voices, like removing from doing rocks
Or mylar balloon shots
They out lying
I’m as groovy as tool box
What is approved chops to a bad bag of silencers
Dubious oo-ops
And movie props
I'm a cool spot
But what happens if me and Vesuvius mood swap?
I'm Kubrick with two plots
If I let my role talk, you still get your school rock
Himalaya, never met a better climb
Kick, push schooled em on the coasts like Pepperdine
Check for signs, like the deaf and dying
Rapper slash chiropractor
Push his album back till he gets more checks than a record's spine
Never trying, but we gon' make it

[Outro]
We gon' make it
We gon' make it

[Verse]
1, 2, 3, 4
Turn out the light and walk me in
Show me what’s holding in your hand
And when the morning comes
And the big light starts creeping its way in
I’ll offer it
I’ll take the crowding out your head
I’ll take your wickedness and sin
And when the evening comes
And you open up your mouth to offer it
I’ll fall right in

[Outro]
What’s that rattling and banging?
What’s shaking up my shit?
What did you let it?

[Verse 1]
Well, wether there was a murder I don't know I wasn't there
I was busy visiting a friend in jail
There were just two women on the scene at the time
Neither one of 'em saw a thing
Both of 'em were wearing veils
They said it was a natural situation
He reached too high and tumbled back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to people on your way up
You might meet 'em again on your way back down

[Refrain]
But its too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back

[Verse 2]
He had a brother named Paul
Hang out at the cafe royal
Where Miss Dolly plays and the reviews have been mixed
Well, he's pretty to look at
Looking for someone to throw the book at
But you know that he drinks and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song about your summer romance
I know you don't know motherless children
Sing me the one about you and Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion
Where conformity's a fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me
Before the final nail is driven in

[Refrain]
But its too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back

[Verse 3]
Dr. Silver Spoon from the empress ballroom
He's a retired businessman
Who feeds off everyone he's touched
He gives money to the church and foundations for research
He's not someone you can play around with to much
But then there's Rosetta Blake
Who's been to both sides of the lake
She's rough to look at
But she's righteously fit
She'll feed you coconut bread and spiced buns in bed
You won't have to worry about sleeping face down with your head in the plate

[Refrain]
But its too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back

[Verse 4]
You'll arrange to see your man tonight
Who tells you some secret things you think might open some doors
How to enter the gates of paradise
No not really
More like how to go crazy from carrying a burden that's never meant to be yours
From the stage they'll be doing the bumps and the grinds
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, and big build universities to study in
And sing amazing grace all the way to the Swiss bank

[Refrain]
But its too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back

[Verse 5]
They got some serious people out there man
They can ring your bell and show you how to hold your tongue
They don't come to party man
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don't believe in mercy and judgment on them is something you'll never see
They can put your face on a postage stamp
Turn your home into a armed camp
Anyway they want you
That's the way you'll be

[Refrain]
But its too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back

[Verse 6]
Yes I loved him too
I still see him in my mind climbing up that hill
Or was it a wall
I don't recall
It don't matter at all honey
And it never will
Ain't nothin' left here partner
Just the dust of fools that have left their mark in spades
From now on this will be where you're from
Let the dead bury the dead
Your time will come
Feel that hot iron glowing now as your raise the shades

[Refrain]
But its too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, to bring him back
Why should data strategy be aligned with business objectives?

I'll be blunt: business tactics fail. A great deal
According to several studies, between 67 and 97 percent of organisational plans fail to accomplish their business objectives. While the specific causes of these failures are numerous and varied (inadequate communication, lack of buy-in, lack of clarity, etc. ), they ultimately boil down to one issue: a mismatch between planning and implementation

While senior lеaders devote grеat time and effort to defining corporate objectives and supporting strategies, achieving those objectives requires the dedicated efforts of the whole organisation - day after day, week after week. The data strategy serves as a roadmap for people responsible for implementing the strategy on a more detailed level, empowering them to make the decisions and take the activities necessary to achieve the organization's objectives

What does data strategy entail?

You'll frequently hear data strategy addressed in conjunction with enterprise data strategy – a comprehensive plan outlining how a company acquires, uses, processes, and maintains data. For the sake of this post, I'd want to define data strategy as a plan outlining how data, people, tools, and processes will interact to support the achievement of certain business goals

A sound data strategy, built on the pillars of data, people, technologies, and processes, will address the following questions:

• What statistics are required to demonstrate progress toward this goal? Is the data freely available, or must we seek it out? Is the data clean, current, dependable, and compatible with our analytics tools – and if not, what do we need to do to prepare it for the challenge?

• Who will be involved in utilising data to accomplish this aim, and what role will each individual play? Who will view the analytics dashboard(s) associated with this goal, and what will their actions be as a result?

• Which technologies will be used to gather data-driven insights relevant to this objective? Are the currently available tools suitable for the job? Is it necessary to consolidate all users into a single analytics platform, or is it possible to accommodate users of disparate applications?

• Which processes must be in place to convert information into action that moves the organisation closer to achieving this business objective? Is it possible to improve existing processes for this goal, or will we need to create new ones?

If you want your essay written by a highly professional writers, then you are in a right place. We have hundreds of highly skilled writers working 24/7 to provide qualityessay writing services to the students all over the World

Another critical component of your data strategy's success in achieving your business objective — one that touches on all four of these pillars — is a well-thought-out change management plan. Implementing a data strategy needs change, and effective change requires more than two or three emails explaining the current state of affairs. Change management aides in ensuring that individuals understand why changes are occurring, how they benefit, and how they affect the data, tools, and processes that surround their everyday job. (For additional information on how to create a successful change management plan, see our article "Enact change management – and make it stay.")

At this point, I'd like to address a common blunder we encounter while dealing with corporations. The data sources should be driven by the company plan, not the other way around. When firms consider how to exploit data as a strategic asset, they frequently ask, "This is the data we have; what can we do with it?" This approach poses the danger of leading the firm into rabbit holes unrelated to the organization's goals. A more reasonable beginning point may be, "This is the objective we're pursuing; where can we locate the evidence to back it up?" This creates a virtuous cycle in which business objectives inform data strategy, which in turn informs business objectives, and so on

How does data strategy contribute to business objectives?

If business strategy establishes a path between your organization's current condition and a desired future state, data strategy establishes mile markers, sign posts, and a clear windshield through which to view them

Any investment in data strategy contributes to the realisation of your strategic objective. Without a well-thought-out strategy for utilising data to drive decisions and activities along the path to your objective, you risk moving in the wrong direction – or perhaps stalling entirely. Therefore, if you're attempting to calculate the return on investment (ROI) of the time and resources required to implement a data strategy, evaluate the predicted returns on your business strategy and consider that data strategy is a critical component of achieving those returns

Specifically, data strategy performs three critical functions in advancing company objectives - both current and future

Orienting your decisions and activities in support of your company objective

The ideal corporate plan is robust but malleable; it is adaptable to changing markets, resources, and situations. Data might provide insights that indicate the necessity for a business plan adjustment. To illustrate, one of our retail clients noted an increase in Amazon orders shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak began. They were able to immediately detect the shift and adjust their sales and revenue plans accordingly by tracking this data

Establishing a feedback mechanism for your business strategy

The ideal corporate plan is robust but malleable; it is adaptable to changing markets, resources, and situations. Data might provide insights that indicate the necessity for a business plan adjustment. To illustrate, one of our retail clients noted an increase in Amazon orders shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak began. They were able to immediately detect the shift and adjust their sales and revenue plans accordingly by tracking this data

Discovering new possibilities

Strategic data utilisation can uncover previously untapped markets, demand trends that may inspire the development of a new product or service, or movements in the competitive environment that may create new opportunities
A strategy for the purpose of driving the strategy

You've invested significant time, resources, and energy in developing your business plan; why should you rely on guesses or gut feelings regarding your progress? A well-thought-out data strategy provides structure and direction for your team's usage of data sources, ensuring that each action advances your business goal – while also exposing some new insights

Data strategy establishes a direct link between the CEO who established the strategic objective and the employee tasked with carrying out the vision's "last mile" actions. When team members have access to clear, accurate, relevant, and actionable data that is presented in an easily consumable way, they are empowered to make daily decisions that move the organisation toward its present and future objectives. It gradually increases awareness and enhances the data culture of the organisation

It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinned

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I nеver felt so good about myself

[Bridge]
Oh fathеr, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 1]
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

[Pre-Chorus]
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe
Please

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right, it's a sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice
Please

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh

[Interlude]
Daddy, daddy
Daddy, daddy

[Bridge]
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love , so, please

[Interlude]
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach
Papa don't preach

[Chorus]
Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep (Papa don't preach)
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh (Papa don't preach)

[Outro]
Don't you stop loving me, daddy (Papa don't preach)
I know, I'm keeping my baby

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
Chrome hearts at the Caesar's Palace
I was a sneaker savage, undefeated baggage
K-BAR, you could be established
A two-thirty's, that's sixty-nines, you can eat a salad while you feed her fallace
I speak in pallets that compete with graphics
At the speed of cheetah gallops, at indecent average
Chopsticks when I be eating Garrett's
Phillippe receipt embarrassed, you can't see the marriage
That's why I started this in Vegas
Propose to my toast, Neos married to the matrix
But I hate this bitch like I'm married to a racist
An addict, so the kilos get buried in the basements
Speed the wagon like reels
Vicarious, vivacious — patois, mwah
But the creole is basic
So when I'm around them Haitians, I don't even say shit
Last album sounded like I was signed to a spaceship
Brain was on drugs and my eyes was on LASIK
And that shit got legs, I don't think that I can chase it with rocket power Asics
But the next one's coming with cases and witness protection facelifts
For the fans — why hit them with ka-bams?
When the germaphobe jab can wash a nigga with hands
I am not in my feelings, I'm in my glands
I am not no bitch, I’m in a trance
Pandemic gimmicks got niggas all into scams
Panhandling brilliance, put lyrics all in they hands
Alan Watts got Was living without a plan
But I want the smoke, that's why the kitchen ain't got no fans (L)

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I like to play with them pots
Young nigga fish tail right off the lot, yeah
Call up my jeweler and buss down a watch
I'm on South beach, posted on yacht
You diss on the gang, you know that yo body gone rot
Spaghetti, bugatti  diamonds they looking like snot
Pull off with the bugatti he know that I can not get caught

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I walk in the mall, ain't no telling what I done bought
I stand in the kitchen and play with the fork
Rocking Givenchy Dior, arm so cold, man I done caught
He caught a cold I put em in a coffin
Business is business its Draco I'm dripping I'm awesome
The pinky ring looking just like flying saucer
Many man now they gone back an opp nigga off me
Ooh I beg your pardon, I don't eat at Olive Garden
Young nigga trap a brand new Aston Martin
Big backwoods smoking gelatto

[?] Wells Fargo
Sipping lean not the baby bottle
Sipping on lean Imma feel it tommorow
Rolling big backwood gelatto
Shoot this bitch up Grand Theft Auto

[Hook: Soulja boy]
I like to play with them pots
Young nigga fish tail right off the lot, yeah
Call up my jeweler and buss down a watch

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Backwood stuffed like enchilado
Ball hard like I hit the lotto
Talk down bout my niggas that shit get colossal
Ride with a bad bitch she look like a model
Young Draco took off just like Nasa
Hop in that Urus, which way go off way faster
Reach for my chain you know that I blam em
Take a trip down to Alabama

[?]
Took off at Tarzan, bullet proof manor
I'm still plugged in the A, like a motherfuckin' falcon
Got them young niggas blitz up on you just like Madden
My pinky look like the ring around Saturn
I done dropped the top back, she sucked me like a vaccum
Sipping on codeine, I feel it all in my bladder
This 30 clip ruger longer than a ladder

[Hook: Soulja boy]
I like to play with them pots
Young nigga fish tail right off the lot, yeah
Call up my jeweler and buss down a watch
I'm on South beach, posted on yacht
You diss on the gang, you know that yo body gone rot
Spaghetti, bugatti  diamonds they looking like snot
Pull off with the bugatti he know that I can not get caught

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
When I took off on that carpet and get like Aladdin
4k and Ak everything was plasma
How you worth 30 million ride around with a hammer
Buss down my chain it look like Antartica
She just took her top off just like Mardi Gras
Big 5'7 ruger nigga will set it off
I'm in a Rari nigga that AK will let it off
672 leave em left like Bermuda
Big Draco I got rich off computers
Cartier buss down and it came in with skeletons
Got like 6 m's sitting all on my schedule
Got the weed tint when I'm all in your area
Got the opp knocked down, nobody buried em
Dirty Glock nigga scratch off the serial
Hop out the bed and I'm pouring wockhart in my cereal
Big Draco they call me superior
Reach for my chain lame ass nigga inferior
Matte purple on the custom interior
The drop top on the rari I'm peeling em
The opp block down you know that I'm killing them
As a young nigga sipping I'm needing the riddalin
You speak on my name you know that I'm killing them
Big Draco worth 30 million
Murder gang Money gang nigga killing them

Done with them you can't cool with it

You used to twerk to every, every song
Saved up to buy an ass of your very, very own
FaceTime, body looks like Dom Perignon
Don't pay me no attention, go and carry on
I guess every lover gon need some hater
This one to say Ye to appreciate you
"Your Power". For me this is a... very personal meaning. I don't wanna talk about it but, um... you know, it was pretty sad when it came out and so many people came to me saying "thank you for this song," it's crazy. I don't know one woman that hasn't been taken advantage of. I just think it should be talked about more because I think that... it's waaay too normalized how many young women are taken advantage of.

[Chorus 1]
The magic of a blackened night
Can go so far, but not seem right
Although my love, will drive away the sunshine
The magic of, a blackened night
And before you go show me
All the words of love

[Chorus 2]
And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and fro the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander
And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and fro the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander
And the falling sands of time
Blow my wind and drifted by
To and fro the trees still bend
Wondering what the host will send
We will go right down to the sea
Bathing in light we will be free to wander

[Chorus 1]
The magic of a blackened night
Can go so far, but not seem right
Although my love, will drive away the sunshine
The magic of, a blackened night

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I get to thinking
About the times we used to have
But now you've gone away and left me so alone
La-di-da, la-di-da-da, la-di-da
Although my back is aching
I'll work the whole day through

[Chorus 2]
Although you hear that I've been wasting all my time
Taking the sun from the sky
Lifting our hearts to the day
Thinking of new revelations
Talking with nothing to say

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I get to thinking
About the times we used to have
But now you've gone away and left me so alone
La-di-da, la-di-da-da, la-di-da
Although my back is aching
I'll work the whole day through

[Chorus 2]
Although you hear that I've been wasting all my time
Taking the sun from the sky
Lifting our hearts to the day
Thinking of new revelations
Talking with nothing to say

[Chorus 1]
Let me re-tell a story I know
About a man named Moses who lived long ago
He prophesied good, he prophesied bad
And now that prophecy's coming to pass

[Chorus 2]
Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Verse 1]
A whole lot of people, including myself
Thought the story of Moses was just a tall tale
But all of the things that we see going on
Are just what Moses set down

[Chorus 2]
Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Chorus 1]
Let me re-tell a story I know
About a man named Moses who lived long ago
He prophesied good, he prophesied bad
And now that prophecy's coming to pass

[Chorus 2]
Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Chorus 3]
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I just can't imagine a reason for sorrow
Just can't imagine the hurt

[Bridge]
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down

[Chorus 3]
I said, lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay down your burden of sorrow
There's just no reason to hurt

[Outro]
You've got to lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I said, lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

[Chorus]
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me, my little child

[Verse]
Shine me a light from your eyes, dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy, show me a smile
Soon you'll be a man, my little one
So have fun while you can or there'll be none
Everything's going fast around you
There will be things to astound you
You'll be a man in your time, my little one

[Chorus]
So take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me, my little child

[Outro]
Shine me a light from your eyes, dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 1]
He came down from Trinity
A midtown boy from home
In the dirt walking miles before
And dreaming of his thirst

[Chorus 2]
Oh, on his way
He had to go
Oh, on his way
He had to go

[Chorus 1]
He came down from Trinity
A midtown boy from home
In the dirt walking miles before
And dreaming of his thirst

[Chorus 2]
Oh, on his way
He had to go
Oh, on his way
He had to go

[Verse 1]
(For your love)
I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
(For your love)
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
For your love, for your love
I would give you stars above
For your love, for your love
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give (For your love)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give
(For your love)
I'd givе the moon every day that I livе

To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

[Chorus]

Yes, there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes, there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes, it was these blues you gave me
When you left me
Ooh, when you left me that day

[Chorus 2]
When somebody leaves you
You just lose a friend
But when you left me, babe
No, it wasn't the end

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
Yes, it was these blues you gave me
When you left me

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there's something inside of me
And it just won't go away
No, no, no
Yes, it was the blues you gave me
When you left me
Ooh, when you left me that day

[Verse 1]
So many nights I lay awake, can't sleep
Maybe think about a woman I used to love
Can't sleep but no good to count sheep
I'll just count the worries I've got plenty of

[Chorus]
How many times must I be the fool?
Before I can make it, oh, make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song?

[Guitar Solo + Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Verse 2]
You talk about life, searching for the key
But can't find an answer to comfort me
Ask myself about love, can't even find the door
To take me to a place I've never seen before

[Chorus]
But how many times must I be thе fool?
Before I can make it, oh, makе it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words, oh
Is there nobody listening to my song?

"Didn't Change My Number"... I love this song so much. It's all about... you can't... get me anymore. Where it's like "you know what? I don't sympathy for you anymore. You know, you got me, you got me at first but I don't care now," and it's really that, and that only. And, um... kind of just your last straw and being like "I am confident in this being my last straw" 

[laughs]. You know, "don't get me mad 'cause I will scream."

[Spoken Intro: Jimi Hendrix]
Very sorry for tuning up, but uh, y'know we do that to protect your ears
That's why we don't play so loud
And cowboys don't understand tune anyway
I'm so glad y'all have patience though, 'cause I don't
Like to do the slow blues

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
We gotta keep movin'
We gotta keep on groovin'
Understand both sides of the sky
We gotta keep on lovin'
Good, sweet lovin'
Make love while I'm dyin', babe

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I get stoned
I can't crawl home
I'm calling long distance
On a public saxophone
My head is dizzy and shakin'
Lord, my whole soul is so tired and achin'
Feel I got run over by a public opinion and the past
And a dog named Rover

[Verse 3]
We gotta keep on rockin'
Don't love me
Midnight lightning strikin' right now
Gotta keep on lovin'
I mean good, sweet lovin'
Make love, I'm not dyin' yet
Love

Okay, we're gonna start all over again
Hello, how you doin’, England?
Glad to see ya
We'll do a thing called "Freedom"

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
You got my pride
Hangin' out of my bed
You got my head bigger
I had to buy my lead
You’ve got with my children
Screamin' at my wife
You better get outta here
One day

[Chorus]
Freedom
That's what I want now
Freedom
That's what I need now
Freedom
To live
Freedom
So I can give

[Verse 2]
You got my head
Spittin' electric water
You got my head
Screamin' and holl'rin'
You got my girlfriend boutta hook up
You know the drugstore man
But I don’t need it now
Unless you’re trying to slap it out of her hand

[Chorus]
Freedom
That's what we want now
Freedom
That’s what we need now
Freedom
Gotta live
Freedom
To you, I wanna give

[Verse 3]
You don't have to
Say that you love me
If you don't mean it
You better believe
If you need me
Or you just want to bleed me
You better sticking your dagger in someone else
So I can be free

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So I can give to you
Freedom
I don't know how they do
Freedom
For the children
Freedom
You bad

[Instrumental Outro]
"Getting Older" was tough to write, you know, 'cause it's a very revealing song and it's talking about things that I, only at the time, had just felt like I realized about myself and felt insecure about, and wanted to talk about, and... I don't know, I think that that happens a lot and it should be completely... welcomed, is realizing stuff years later 

[laughs]. You sometimes don't realize what's going on around you until a really long time later, or realize what you feel until years later.
"Billie Bossa Nova" 's a little bit of a... fantasy... I don't even know what. We actually called this song "Billie Bossa Nova" because in... I wanna say like spring of 2019, my brother sent me a beat that he had made and he called it "Billie Bossa Nova" 'cause it was just a Bossa Nova type beat, and I was like "that's amazing," and then, nothing happened for like a year and a half, um... and then... we listened to it again and kind of wrote this fantasy, romanticized, glorified dream.
"my future" is a... I hold very close to my heart. It wasn't really the first song we wrote after the album but it was to me... like, it felt like the beginning of a new... "world," and a new feeling. It's cute to me now because I listen to it and... the girl singing it —which is me then— is singing about me now, and that makes me feel good. I listen to it now thinking about the future future me, and it, it gives me hope and... excites me.
"Oxytocin" 's a fun one, that's probably one of my favourites. We had all these songs and I was like "only thing we're missing is... the song that's gonna be... purposefully insane live". And we made "Oxytocin". Oh my god, it was the most satisfying thing in the world. We would, like, stand up and, like, jump around and see what felt... right. I was also just... going through crazy feelings at the time, too. And you can understand those if you listen to the lyrics 

[laughs].
Um... "GOLDWING", I... wrote a song that is kind of a metaphor for, you know, a young woman, especially in the industry, or in... you know, life, that is pure, and I don't mean a virgin, I mean, like a young non-exploited, non-traumatized person. A metaphor for that being, you know, a goldwinged angel.
"Lost Cause", I mean, speaks for itself. Uh... you know, what do you want me to say? I ah...uh, I was thinking it and I said it 

[laughs]. Yeah.
"Halley's Comet". Y'know... "Halley's Comet" 's just about falling in love and feeling of, a feeling of... euphoria and... life kind of feeling like you're floating and... y'know. Love is a crazy crazy thing and, "Halley's Comet" 's just like a sweet little romantic song.
"Not My Responsibility"... these are some of my favourite words I've ever written. And I feel like nobody listened 

[laughs], uh. It's all about body image and all the things we are trained to think and feel about bodies, and it just makes me laugh because I put it out and everyone was like "yes, queen," "body positivity," "uh." And then, like, three months later there's a picture of me in a tank top and the whole internet was like "fat!" So... 

[laughs].
We took the production from "Not My Responsibility" and made it into a beat, and then wrote "OverHeated", and it's really just about the same thing, y'know, why the fuck is it such a shock that I look like all of you? And I think that that's the funny thing, is the internet... you know, you feel so powerful and... somehow invisible at the same time? But... everybody sees it. You say crazy stuff on the internet thinking "ah... nobody will see it". It's really just about the... insanity of... paparazzi, and articles, and comment sections, and Twitter!
This song is a big bummer. It's really... about how... everybody dies. You can’t change it, and it's a horrible thought. But it's also a comforting thought? I don’t know, it, like, gives me comfort to know I'm gonna die, I don't know why. I talked a, I've talked about it since I was a kid. Makes me feel... happy that all things end. It's also very sad and sentimental. This song is really just about knowing that you only have so long to do what you want, so just do it and... enjoy your life.
"NDA" is kind of all over the map... it's got a lot of different things going on, that were completely different situations. It's really just, like, things that I was thinking and feeling and... doing in my life and I was like "I'm just gonna write about it" 

[repeats babbling the same thing and laughs]. Um... I don't know, I think it's very cool but... "NDA" is very... all over the place and up for interpretation, really.
"Therefore I Am"... 

[laughs] it's funny, I've recently seen people talk about who they think it's about and I'm like "what are you talking about?" It's actually not about anybody I know, it's not about anybody that I've ever had a friendship or a relationship with, it's about people, types of people, and... yeah, I don't know, it's like, I'm not really gonna talk about what it's actually about, but it's just a fun one. It's just like a "don't take me seriously" song 

[laughs].
"Happier Than Ever"! Probably the most therapeutic song I've ever written or recorded? Like, ever, ever, ever? 'Cause I just screamed my lungs out and could barely talk afterwards which was very satisfying to me somehow? I had wanted to get those screams out for a very long time. And it was very nice, too.
"Male Fantasy" 's really... a hopeless realization? And a... horrible thing 

[laughs]. It's terrible to feel... something that you don't want to feel. "Happier Than Ever" was actually gonna close the album, and then we wrote "Male Fantasy", and it actually... felt better to close it with that. You know, not ending on a... angry note, I think, was important, 'cause nothing shoud end on a bad note, I feel like.

[Verse 1]
I wish you gave me a reason
That you were better at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seein' me low
I always let the good ones go
Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothin' more than broke
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'causе they're all I know
I always let thе good ones go

[Chorus]
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones

[Verse 2]
Let you down easy, I'm tryin'
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fightin'
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah, yeah)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And baby you couldn't have loved me any better, better, better)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(But doin' this is all that I've known ever, ever, ever)
I let the good ones go
Oh yeah you wanna take it there
Take a square and lighten up
Cool afternoon it's a holiday
With you there's no room for lament

Auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again
Emoji that kiss goodbye (oh, yeah)
Ladybug fly
Wave, waving all the awful and the off putting away
Wave, waving all the awful bullshit away

There's a truth and that truth can't be denied
Out of tune we're consumed by a lonely device
Ooo, did it happen to you?
Did it trap it a fool?
Bought and sold you
Too cruel, actually

Auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again
Emoji that kiss goodbyе
Ladybug
Wave (wave)
Wave (wavе)
Holding on to me
You're holding on to me
Holding on to me
Holding on to me

Holding on to me
You're holding on to me
Holding on to me
You're holding on to me
Four Data Obstacles in the Development of Medical AI

As healthcare and medicine approach the fourth industrial revolution, which is characterised by increased automation and the use of smart technology, artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise in areas such as drug discovery, patient diagnosis, and treatment. Despite constantly expanding demand, model development continues to face obstacles. These difficulties include those inherent in machine learning, such as the requirement to address edge cases, avoid AI bias and drift, and require a huge amount of human effort to train data and validate and enhance machine learning models regularly

Data input is a briskly growing sector in Pakistan. Information Transformation Services can meet a variety of Data Entry Services
Competently and professionally. ITS will not only provide various data entry services to customers, but will also offer some creative and customized solutions to meet your needs



It is critical to overcome these obstacles in order to have a meaningful and measurable impact on patient outcomes and medical research. Additionally, the healthcare industry faces unique problems, which must be addressed in order to ensure the safe and timely implementation of AI in real-world scenarios. After all, there is little margin for error when the difference between sickness and wellness is at stake

1. Protection of Personal Information and Regulatory Compliance

All healthcare data must adhere to severe regulatory requirements, including HIPAA and HITECH in the United States and GDPR in Europe. These mandatory guidelines were implemented to protect patient privacy and to regulate the acquisition, management, and transmission of personally identifiable information (PII), such as healthcare records and medical images. Compliance in the development of medical AI is exacerbated by the fact that these data privacy standards predate AI and many of the other technologies on which healthcare relies today

To deliver on the promise of medical AI, massive amounts of data, such as MRI scans and X-rays, are required to build sufficient training data sets. As such, a transparent process must exist for individuals to opt in to contribute to development. Fortunately, in the majority of circumstances, it is easy to anonymize healthcare data for use in developing AI models without jeopardising its utility

For instance, V7 Labs and CloudFactory have collaborated to make available an annotated X-ray dataset to aid with COVID-19 research. V7 gathered 6,000 lung scans from several open-source datasets—a mix of patients with and without COVID-19—and assisted in training CloudFactory's managed workforce to optimise the data for machine learning by combining AI-driven auto-labeling and detailed human-led image annotation

2. Data Access and Collection
Additionally, the massive amounts of data required for medical AI training face logistical issues. Depending on the model's objective, this may include data collection from a variety of sources, including electronic health records, insurance claims, pharmacy information, and consumer-generated data via activity trackers and other wearable technology. Because this data is frequently fragmented across numerous systems, curating complete, high-quality data sets can be a significant undertaking

Academic Master  is a US based writing company that provides thousands of free essays to the students all over the World. If you want your essay written by a highly professional writers, then you are in a right place. We have hundreds of highly skilled writers working 24/7 to provide qualityessay writing services to the students all over the World


Continued digitalization of healthcare records, in conjunction with a simple and transparent mechanism for patients to participate to AI development, is crucial for this to occur. Fortunately, new frameworks for treating health data as a public good while safeguarding patient privacy are being established, making it easier for research and development teams to obtain the data necessary to build effective models

3. Artificial Intelligence Bias

Another consideration for the data collection stage is the requirement for representative data sets. Without a diverse workforce, AI prejudice can become a severe problem, to the point of impairing patient care. For instance, AI developed to detect sickle cell disease must take into account the fact that the sickle cell trait is significantly more prevalent in African American and Central and South American ancestry communities. As a result, the data sets utilised to train the model must have an exact, matching representation of those populations

A similar issue with AI bias is the model itself, which is designed by humans and may contain prejudice. As Michael Li recently noted in his Harvard Business Review article, "the bias in our human-built AI is almost certainly due to a lack of diversity among the humans who built them." It has thus been noted that diversity within the engineering or data science team developing the model can be critical in reducing AI bias during development, even before training data is introduced

4. Expertise in the Industry and Quality Assurance

Quality control and quality assurance are critical in the development of medical AI. After all, artificial intelligence in healthcare is no longer completely passive. Along with assisting practitioners in their decision-making processes, AI may function in their place in some applications. As a result, the tolerance for errors is quite low. To earn the trust of patients and providers, medical AI models must be extensively trained and optimised. During these stages, model specialisation is frequently required

For instance, if AI is to interpret X-rays and MRIs in order to recommend a diagnosis and directly effect patient care, the images used for training should undergo a rigorous quality assurance/quality control process to verify labelling accuracy for each training image. On the other hand, if the project involves labelling data for preliminary, exploratory medical research, where speed and direction setting are paramount, a less rigorous quality assurance method may be more acceptable. The trick is to ensure that your quality assurance procedures are proportionate to the acceptable margin of error for your project. Having said that, it is critical to have a skilled staff that is capable of scaling quickly and possesses the aptitude, ability, and patience necessary to learn and work effectively without sacrificing quality

Scaling Medical Artificial Intelligence Through a Managed Workforce

While it may appear that the issues associated with medical data processing and labelling are unique to medical practitioners, this is not always the case. After instance, such an approach is difficult to scale, and it may have a negative impact on critical elements such as patient outcomes if it requires medical practitioners to divert their attention away from direct patient care or research

Follow your favorite writers, create groups, forums, chat, and much much more!

Due of the stringent quality control and assurance requirements, typical business process outsourcing and crowdsourcing are rarely suited for the compilation of medical data. While it may appear that the only way to scale this highly specialised labelling is to hire personnel skilled in the specialty field to execute the labelling, this can create a significant bottleneck and financial burden. Collaboration with a skilled managed workforce adept in annotating highly specialised medical images, on the other hand, can relieve the strain without sacrificing quality or monitoring. Scaling effectively will require a rigorous approach that includes extensive vetting, skill development, and openness

Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can’t walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
Thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There’s no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 3]
I thought I hеard a young man mourn this morning
Thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dеw today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Thank you. We're making adjustments as you can see. Donna Jean won't be with us on this tour as her condition has regressed to the point where it’s probably not too advisable that she ride around on airplanes and the like

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's a three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl that's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
Shе said her name was Billie Jеan and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
Then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And now I'll spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
But don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing around the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse 2]
I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretеnd it came to an end
'Cause you wеren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who'd never think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Done better by me than I've done by you

[Verse 3]
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your bag wherever you go
Full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
You capture a glance, oh, oh, bound to make a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, lost from the light
I'll turn around, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Turning around, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Lord, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh, oh, and I'm drowning in you
I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Lord, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh, oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh, oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh, oh, I'm drowning in you
Lord, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh, oh, I'm drowning in you

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street
With a dollar in my hand
I was looking for a woman
Sweet mama didn't have no man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, she's sweet and true
The dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea
She brings me about every darn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I was walking down Main, Deep Elem in June
You know all those women down there got the Texas blues

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Outro]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

That's to tell me whether my brain is working or not, man. (When are you coming to New York?) When is New York coming to us? Better that left unsaid. The scopes are for my entertainment, man

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I followed hеr down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
Well, I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on thе land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on thе land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you. We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreaming
Get out the way, get out the way

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 2]
Line up a long shot
Maybe try it two times, maybe more
Good to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor
Why hold out for more?

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Asking you nice
Keep the mother rolling one more time
Been down before, but you just don't have to go no more
No more

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Prelude]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
And summer leaves are blown away
And what remains? The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And littlе change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a dеsert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The knowing in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
The same old friends the wind and rain
(We'll see summer by and by)
Winter gray and falling rain
(Seasons fade and roses die)
We'll see summer come again
(Summers fade and roses die)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
The same old friends the wind and rain
(Like a song that's born to soar the sky)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Hello? Hello? Brought with hassles, ah, these aren't, ha. This ain’t on, now it is. Boogie, boogie, boogie

[Verse 1]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I don’t wanna be treated this a-way
This a-way
And I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, she went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Oh, run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows his wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay
Night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my tickets when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunshine
Now come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream
Well, coming, coming from a daydream
Sunshine daydream
Well, now wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Go anywhere the wind blows
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out, wait, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, I wanna woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, I wanna woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, I wanna woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, I wanna woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream
Well, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream
A-coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, I wanna hey,-ow
Sunshine daydream, I wanna hey-ow
Sunshine daydream, hey, ow
Sunshine daydream, I wanna woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, I wanna hey, hey
Sunshine daydream, I wanna hey-ow
Sunshine daydream, hey-ow
Hey-ow, hey-ow, hey-ow
Thank you all and good night

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
Get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up and one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
(Cosmic Charlie, yeah!) Uh, that's another one that we forgot. Yeah, you know, like, most of them tunes we used to do with two drummers, we don't do them anymore, you know? Most of the things we used to do with Pigpen we don't do them anymore either. That should serve to remind you that we've forgotten that number. We tried to work it up in soundcheck and forgot

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Well, huh, well now, beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes, and I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back where I belong
Yes, and I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Yes now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Coal mine)
Coal mine, well now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine
So rock on now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, she's waiting there for me
Hey now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Said happy home (Happy home)
Said a happy, said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Happy home, well now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot County
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
You take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Interlude]
See if this one's working yet. (What was that?) Turn it up more, turn it more, Sparky, it's still not great, very much there. (Listen, you can't yell sentences of more than five words at us. We're a little shell shocked, you understand, so keep 'em simple, folks.) Right, keep your verb tenses real simple, too. (None of your business, man. What are you, the heat? You're awful curious. Yeah right, take off your disguise, man, and show us who you really are. Let's have a spotlight on this man here. One, two, three, four from the rear, I mean four from the front, ha ha. Slowest light crew in the world.)

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
And dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Prelude]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
And summer leaves are blown away
And what remains? The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
Seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The knowing in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
The same old friends the wind and rain
(We'll see summer by and by)
Winter gray and falling rain
(Seasons fade and roses die)
We'll see summer come again
(Summers fade and roses die)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
The same old friends the wind and rain
(Like a song that's born to soar the sky)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Harvest dreams, with bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Intro]
How many of you were listening to the radio last night?

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
Know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayеd for better weathеr

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
Well, I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin’, like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won’t let you be

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don’t lay ’em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin’ on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain’t it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no, no, no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'm goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
In the end there's still that song, comes crying likе the wind
Down every lonеly street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make 'em shine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And when you hear that song, come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Thanks a lot, folks

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
Thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone this morning?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
Thought I heard a young man mourn today
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Good night, folks. See y'all later. Next time around

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailing up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in the way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
They cannot explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
Though you'll make a noise, they just can't hear your voice
They're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Bridge]
You will believe what I say is true
Everything I'm singing, I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
I heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon won't trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
Well, my mama told me and my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
And you shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Well, I went to the depot, I never got therе on time
Well, I went to thе depot, never got there on time
Well, the train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

And now, ladies and gentlemen, the dog-suckinest man in show business, Mr. Pigpen

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' loving, child, I got some good in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle (Ow)
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Verse 2]
Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got you another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand and don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free so won't you place your ad with me

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Bridge]
Give it to me, I got to have it
Some of your love, it's all I need
Early in the morning, if I don't get your love, child
Late in the evening, I got to drive me wild
And I get just a little bit hard to handle now, mama
A little bit hard to handle now, child
A little bit hard to handle now, mama
A little bit hard to handle now, child
Ow, make me feel alright when I get it
Make me feel alright when I want it
Make me feel alright when I get it
When I get it, when I want it, it make me feel just so fine
Go on now, ow, woo, uh
Got to have some, woo-wee, ha
I got to need that love, got to get you some love
I gotta have that love in the morning sometime
Yes, and, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
And I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Outro]
Ow
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down and just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time and Bobby clapping hands
We pined to sing near every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lalala, lalala

[Outro]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
Yeah

Our executive nanny has just showed up with the cigarettes so it'll be a couple of minutes

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Refrain]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la

Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymorе
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on thе wind
La-la-la-la, la, la, la

[Verse 5]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Outro]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
’Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won’t you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody’s choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John’s Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He’s come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Deep back up in the pines among the evergreens
There is an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
Thе people passing by would stop and say
"Whoa, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Whoa, Johnny B. Goodе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
Will hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Whoa, go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Oh, Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Ow
Ah, go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Whoa, Johnny B. Goode
Good evening, folks. (Thanks a lot, people.) That's all the time we got

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying a lot of words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall all over my back

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: The Grateful Dead]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone
I know you, ridеr, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gonе
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, yeah

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, yeah

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Whoa, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Whoa, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Yeah, now, hey

[Instrumental Break]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Wah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Whoa, get back truckin' on

Thank you

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still have to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Cryptical Envelopment/Quodlibet For Tender Feet]

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse]
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die"
And all the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin' to watch him die

Summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
All the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, oh, they's all around
With liquor and money, oh, they loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey now, high-low jack and thе winner take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My unclе started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, and I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, yeah, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey now, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, well, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Cryptical Envelopment/Quodlibet For Tender Feet]

[Verse]
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die

You know he had to die, he had to die
You know he had to die

You know he had to die
You know he had to die
You know he had to die
You know he had to die
Well, you know he had to die

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I knew he has been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Verse 4]
I got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she’d have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo’s crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
(One, two, three, four)
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
Then ride out singin’; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Come on, come on over, daydream
Sweet lovin' daydream
Whoa, come on over, daydream
Oh, what a daydream
Oh, what a daydream
Sunshine daydream
Sweet lovin’ daydream
Come over and daydream
Hey, oh, oh
Come on over and daydream
Hey, oh, oh
Hey, oh, oh
Hey, oh, oh
Sweet lovin' daydream

[Intro: Madonna]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Missy and Madonna boy, ain't nothin' better
Hotter than fat dancin' in a sweater
Madonna, am I okay skinny or fatter?
When I rap on this track, all I smell is cheddar
You and I together, yo', we're tougher than leather
Make pop artists scatter when we talk chit-chatter
It really don't matter what time of day or weather
Or who really fatter, my kadunk-kadunk badder
A rap so sick, won't stop, won't quit
All on my -ish, like my name was 50 Cent, G-Unit
I come with the heat, see my hits
Sound so sweet, Missy ain't pissy
Is you dizzy, is you with me?
Tip me when you see me, 'cause you tryna get with me
Madonna bring the drama, oh mama, that's trauma
Tougher than armor for your pappy and your mama

[Verse 2: Madonna & Missy Elliott]
I tried to be a boy, I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess, I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong, that's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
(I'd like to express my extreme point of view)
(I'd like to express my extreme point of view)
(A Madonna exclusive)
So I went into a bar, looking for sympathy
A little company, I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said, it's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free
Do I have to change my name?
(C'mon)

[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]
American life
(American life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
(Just a dream)

[Verse 3: Madonna]
I tried to stay ahead, I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part, but some how I forgot
Just what I did it for, and why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah, uh-huh

[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]
American life
(American life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
(Just a dream)

[Interlude: Missy Elliott]
This is a Madonna exclusive
This is the American life

[Verse 4: Madonna]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef (Chef)
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet (Jet)
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five (Five)
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied? (Woo)
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems
What it seems

[Chorus: Madonna & Tweet]
American life
(American life)
I live the American Dream
(American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream
(Just a dream)
(American life)

[Outro: Missy Elliott]
This is the American Life

Is the microphone on?

[Verse 1]
Hey baby where do you coming from?
Well, she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said "I'm coming from the land of a new rising sun"
Then I said, "Hey baby, where you trying to go to?"
Then she said "I’m going to spin and spread around peace of mind And a whole lot of love to you and your"

[Chorus]
Hey, girl, I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along

Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?

Sometimеs I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tеll that you like it

The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do

If you want it, you already got it

Madonna

[Outro: Madonna]
Time is waiting, time is waiting (Say the word)

[Verse 1]
What are you waiting for? Nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else to do what you can do right now?
Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me

[Verse 2]
They say that a good thing never lasts, and then it has to fall
Those are the people that did not amount to much at all
Gimme the baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me
Give it to me

Hey Joe, I said "Where you going with that gun in your hand?"
Hey Joe, I said, "Where you going with that gun in your hand?"

[Verse 2]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

[Verse 3]
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground

Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun, I shot her!

Hey Joe, where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it

[Verse 6]
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me

[Verse 7]
Ain't no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now, I got to go now

You know you're a cute little heartbreaker

Let me stand next to your fire

Hey, let me stand next to your fire

Whoa, let me stand, baby

Oh! Let me stand, baby

I ain't gonna do you no harm
(Let me stand next to your fire)

[Spoken Intro: Jimi Hendrix]
We'd like to jam another slow song for you, if it's alright
It's a slow blues, it's what we do
We did it one time before
And like, we try to do it now
It's nothing but a jam anyway

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Well, I
Wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Take me, take me
Take me away
From this
Lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm gonna come back to this town
Buy this town
Kinda magical, yeah
Won't come back to this town
Back to this town
Might even get a piece of you
Might even get a little piece of you
And if you and me make love, girl
You know I love you, yes I do

Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today

[Verse]
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me
So I can be on my miserable way

[Chorus]
I don't
Live today
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh
I don't
Live today

[Interlude]
It's such a shame to
Waste your time away like this

[Chorus]
Well, I don't
Live today
Maybe tomorrow

Live today

Spend the time away like this

Lord, that's where my baby stays, yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
Lord have mercy, my baby don't live here no more
That's alright, I still got my guitar

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yondеr
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back ovеr yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things, don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Night work
Another one from Mama Electronica
Peace and blessings!
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Existential crisis
Hip-hop treat him like a Christian at ISIS
Eat his freeze pops with an icepick
The word of the day is birds of prey, Harley bars
Sturgis, in a flight
With his devices, still getting service
You might find shanks in my cell searches
Compelled in the midst of this sickness, give birth to verses
It hurts like a sea urchin, surface if you assertive
I want a whale-tail Porsche with a burden of worthless purpose
To bathe in the glow of the power of urban purchase
Special like 38, maxwell burger plate
Westside percolate, more Chicago than the murder rate
Worth it like a broken weight, ergonomic Urkel
Teach you how to purposely organize and sort all of your work in space
Face ass, don't know how to make jazz
There's a picture floating around of me and Elon in a spacecraft
That's irrelevant but it's true, like a felon up in pelican settling in the SHU
Air maximum, stand up in the chair, put my knife up in the vent just to rap to them
Spirit animal buffalo, lyric level baffling
Could've got murdered on madison, it occurred to me
That's why I moved out of the way like castling
On the back of my crafty little babbling
Now I wanna drive a 911 like it's an emergency
Turbo whining like burgundy, exhaust spitting like Curren$y
Seat back like a root canal, direct from Germany
Start a little war, and then a little insurgency
Yeah!

[Chours]

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Verse 1]
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try (Uh)
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe (Ah)
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—

Night Work...
This exercise man
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I'd like to thank my mama
For making that tank of piranhas
That y'all know as Lu
Treat a track like 

[???]
Make a plate of content
Bake away the nonsense
...and then I chew
Same teeth since I was two
I don't like to beef so let's meet behind the moo'
My skill level accrue
I think I used to stink like the street behind the zoo
Then it all started to sink like a leak inside a cruise
I improve lil' Lu turned into Louvre
Wordplay put on a suit like it was sewed
Sounding like the bomb, smelling like a fuse
Venting like a locker, hurt like he abused
Work like he confused, to be or not to be
A Shakespearean economy, a vocabulary in views
I'm like what if Drake had the sniper rifle
Ape on the Empire and thinking on a higher Eiffel
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Be that nigga
And you be that nigga
And you walk around with yo bitch and you just be that nigga
And as soon as you leave that nigga

[?] you don’t need that nigga

[Chorus]
See that nigga, see it?
See that nigga, see it?
See that nigga, see it?

[Intro]
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Why are you mad at me?
Just because I have more money to see?
Just because I have a better J-O-B?
Or just because my woman is not ugly?
Is it because of bigger rocks in my jewelry?
And I can hang out like a celebrity?
You must not know I'm blessed by G-O-D
That's no reason to hate on me

[Verse 1]
I'm working hard for my money like Donna Summer
You look look at me like I'm Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dummer
So what I got a sick hundred and convertible Hummer
I'm doing something positive ain't that a bummer
You try to treat mе like I'm a new comer
I'm still digging in hеr pipes like I am a plumber
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
This happens every each and every day

[Chorus]
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Do me a favor (Favor)
Open the door
And let 'em in (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's a lot of trouble everyday that I walk
Haters haters all over, LA to New York
Finna work to stop the rulers, and all of them talkers
Like I'm from outer space, like I'm from Mars
I'm the Biz Markie, as you can see
Most definitely don't have a PhD
I don't know why people get M-A-D
I thought everybody 'round was an O-P-P
Like Jamie said "Don't get mad, go get your own"
You are acting childish and I'm full grown
This is one thing that y'all don't know
But I'm b-b-b-b-b-b-bad to the bone
Y'all know what I'm talking about
If haters do exist let me hear you shout
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
This happens each and every day

[Chorus]
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Do me a favor (Favor)
Open the door
And let 'em in (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 3]
The ulterior motive of some ladies are
Different from the gentle 70's and 80's
It used to be about love from heart to heart
Now they want to know what you drive before they start
What kinda car, how much money in your bank
Is it Moet or Crystal that you drank
Now they want to be your friend and that's not your man
They play dumb like they don't understand
When your happy they hate to see because misery love's company
Most of y'all young ladies gotta learn how to wait
Don't worry god will make us good anyways
What come's around goes around in it's own right
It happens it don't matter if your black or white
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
This happens each and every day

[Chorus]
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Do me a favor (Favor)
Open the door
And let 'em in (Oh, yeah)
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Someone's knocking at my door (Haters)
Someone's ringing the bell (Haters)
Do me a favor (Favor)
Open the door
And let 'em in (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 4]
What's your name? (Biz Markie)
What's your sign? (I'm an Aries)
How you feeling? (You know how I'm feeling)
I'm feeling fine (Okay, baby)
What's your name? (Biz Markie)
What's your sign? (I'm an Aries)
How you feeling? (You know how I'm feeling)
I'm feeling fine (Okay, baby)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Oh Satan will make you do the wrong thing
Straighten out Your life in Jesus Name
You that you will do the real thing
When you put your life in Jesus Name

[Pre-Chorus]

No life is wasted when you were reborn
And it don’t really matter what you’ve done
Don’t be discouraged don’t be ashamed

[Chorus]

Straighten out your life
Straighten your your life ..that’s the one
Straighten out your life in Jesus Name

[Pre-Chorus]

Oh, No life is wasted when your reborn

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Ah you feel the difference , you see the change

[Outro]

I think out better Straighten out your Life
Straighten out your life (10x)
Lyrics from Snippet

...shit would play out the way it did
I ain't gon' lie, this shit hurt me for real
Well, I'ma be fine, this shit is what it is
I'm gettin' high, I'm tryna deal with myself
Tryna numb the pain (Numb the pain)
This shit ain't been the same since you walked away
How the fuck you gon' sit back and act like I'm to blame?
I can't let you do this all over again
Oh you, you just can't help yourself
Oh you, you put me off the...

[Intro]
Huh
Huh, huh
Hey

I know you seen another woman's picture on my phone
But please don't leave me alone
Saying

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (huh)
Go-go, go-go (hey)
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (don't leave me) (hey)
Go-go, go-go (oh wait a minute)

[Verse 2]
Let me take you out to dinner and a day at the spa
Put some cash money down on a brand new car
A buncha new bags, a closet full of shoes
But that's a pussy that I can't lose ohh

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (hey) (noooo)
Go-go, go-go (please)
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (don't leave me) (hey)
Go-go, go-go (alright)
Saying

[Verse 3]
Any lovеrs in the house tonight
Wave your hands, whеre y'all at?
Fellas if you ever lost that woman
What would you do to bring her back?
Would you change your number
Work out all summer
Then buy a big house next door to her mama?
Get her name tattooed real big on your arm
And let her know that she's the only one?
Saying

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (huh) (hey)
Go-go, go-go (please)
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (don't leave me) (noooo)
Go-go, go-go
Saying
You wanna know why?

[Bridge]
She's beautiful, one of a kind
Worth my money and all of my time
I said "Darling I realised, baby I apologised"
"Let's spend the rest of our lives together"

[Chorus]
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (ohhhh baby, don't you go-go, go-go) (ohhh lord)
Go-go, go-go (heyyy)
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go (don't leave me) (nooo nooo)
Go-go, go-go (owww)
Saying

Baby, don't you go-go, go-go
Go-go, go-go
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go
Go-go, go-go
Saying

Baby, don't you go-go, go-go
Go-go, go-go
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go
Go-go, go-go
Baby, don't you go-go, go-go

[Verse 1]
Please don't get answers from eyes
You know that mine can't lie quite as well as yours
Just let the spare moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through the open doors

[Verse 2]
Please don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every time, but I'd start to shake
I wander around for days
Wondering what I'll say when they want the truth
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, you will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favors for me, oh

[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favors for me, oh

[Refrain]
You will never know how hard I try
Oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Trippin', wildin' on television
You could still see a nigga tell the vision
Pimpin' (Pimpin'), boy, these boys, pimpin'
Different, these boys, boys different
Trippin', wildin' on television
You could still see and tell the vision
Vivid, what else? What now? These boys pimpin'
Livin' (Hey), you could tell these boys different
Different, I could feel something different
Different, I could still tell the vision
Trippin', wildin' on television
Vivid, hit it, Polow, Timbo, take my pimpin'
By me, they grow, payroll, they roll (Toni, what?)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm drippin' (Drippin'), drenched (Drippin')
Can't pay me like you paid Pippen (Pippen), damn (That's my nigga, though)
Got it out the mud in the kitchen
Uh, my way, my way or the highway (Skrrt)
Yahweh, Allah, God, Jehovah (Lord)
I ain't me when I'm sober, I could play a flute to a cobra (Tell 'em)
I ain't goin' back and forth with niggas like Anna Kournikova (Woo)
After this verse, put a portrait up (Bah), this for the unfortunate (Yeah)
This here for the drug dealers, please don't take it personal (Please)
I ain't talkin' 'bout television, I'll sit it in person (Person)
Niggas scammin' on P.P.E., trickin' off on purses (Yeah)
Purpose (Find one), I keep sendin' these hearses (Uh)
I keep payin' for funerals, sendin' discounts at churches (Damn)
Chicken talk (Chicken talk), in and out with a kitchen fork (Skrrt, skrrt)
Scope on it, hope you find what you're lookin' for (Bah)

[Verse 3: Conway the Machine]
Tell the vision (Damn)
They ain't believe in me, they ain't see the vision (No)
Now look at Yeezy, I did it my way, did it different (Mhm)
They don't like to see a black man multi-billion
GAP money, billboard on your buildin'
This the new Wu-Tang, Yeezy for the children
Mama said, "When you gon' get your soul right? When you repentin'?"
Look, I'm speakin' the gospel
Sixty people shot last weekend in Chicago
I'm followin' Jesus like I'm one of the apostles
I walk by faith, so my confidence is colossal
And that's on God, though, this that New God Flow
The word in my Bible, the Lord on my side
Through my lows and my highs, though (Yeah)
Through my lows and my highs, though
I owe it all to God, though (Yee)

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
Telling my brothers to stay calm, though
Turned to a monster, won't let it go to a-
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me (Yeah)
In the sunken-

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Alien, magical, flyin', and all
Being, I got her signed on
Beam me up, I'm 'bout to sign off
Dumber now, need to take time off
Dumber now, I don't bеlieve the timе
Should have gone, man, I believe they lyin' (Get a mic, huh)
Sign, do you believe in science?
Bigger sign, bet they gon' bleed no-

[Verse: Kanye West]
Alien, takeoff, I took time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
I've just been feeling nine
We gon' just leave at nine
Christian calendar, some-some calendar
Airplane, challenge us, happen to challenge her
Said, "It blow up," Michael Moore said, "Know what? Ain't nobody die!"
Alex Jones said the same shit and fried, oh shit!
Alien, pyramid, fly off, take off
Break off, Kit Kat, take off, wake up
Make off, they go, say go, get makeov'
You let go in Waco, Texas
Pull up, err-err, 'Lexus
Flex this, bless this, genesis, precious
Message, message, bless it
Don't stress it, don't stress shit
Don't test it, don't test this
Don't touch this, man they Hammer time
On the dotted line, on the camera time
When it's out of line and they meant it right
Done it down to nine, on the dotted line
Want a better line and I'm feeling right
Kill the feeling, right, oh and I made it rhyme
'Cause I met a time and you're out of time
And you wear the line and he out of line
But he set it off, on the Adderall
When they got it all, set it off y'all

[Outro: Kanye West]
Alien, takeoff, monster

[Verse 1]
Girl in the bathroom, Florida key
Certainties all away
Brother of cocaine, a tequila son-in-law
End of the world today
How do the clouds get as pink as a peach?
Strike up the contraband
Get introduced to God in the negative
Both supply and demand

[Pre-Chorus]
All day swimming, under the palm trees
Look how they gracefully sway
Some kinda gin drink, some kinda jewelry
Some kinda fancy machine
Why is there always crying and quarreling
Filtering through the malaise?
I can hear someone runnin' their mouth and
The neighbors will call the policе
And here we go, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
That lifе
That life
That life
That life
You're always gonna be about
Mmm, that life
Oh, that life
Yeah, that life
You're always gonna be about

[Verse 2]
Morbid beauty, the skull of the school
The apple o' Daddy's eye
Possibly not so hydrodynamic
Need some electrolyte
Boiling tarmac, a hole in the hull
The cherry chill of dawn
So far away from the nearest jaguar
Who's gonna eat them all

[Pre-Chorus]
All day swimming, under the palm trees
Look how they gracefully sway
Some kinda gin drink, some kinda jewelry
Some kinda fancy machine
Why is there always crying and quarreling
Filtering through the malaise?
I can hear someone runnin' their mouth and
The neighbors will call the police
And here we go, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
That life
That life
That life
That life
You're always gonna be about
Mmm, that life
Oh, that life
Yeah, that life
You're always gonna be about

[Intro]
Nuh
Hey, I-, I-

[Verse]
There's pain in your eyes 'cause you've come through a lot
You can't even sleep when you turn the lights off
White noise in your head makes it harder to breathe
But easier to tell me when it's time for me to leave

[Hook]
You're in pieces
Because you desire what you want, but you don't know how to get them now
This happened at the start, everytimе we try we fall apart
You can't seem to hold my heart
Closе to you
And I know that you make it clear that you want me out of here
Though it's loneliness you fear
Close to you

[Refrain]
But you don't know how to get them now (Nuh, hey!)
But you don't know how to get them now (Nuh)
Close to you

[Hook]
You're in pieces
Because you desire what you want, but you don't know how to get them now
This happened at the start, everytime we try we fall apart
You can't seem to hold my heart
Close to you
And I know that you make it clear that you want me out of here
Though it's loneliness you fear
Close to you

[Refrain]
But you don't know how to get them now (Nuh, hey!)
But you don't know how to get them now (Nuh)
But you don't know how to get them now (Nuh, hey!)
But you don't know how to get them now (Nuh)
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father, told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said: "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home, no matter where you are"
One day my father, he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me

[Intro: Kanye West]
Saw the future of the- 

[?]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Saw the future of the bounce
You can see wherever it soun-
I could do it where it counts
I got nothin' for the low
I been sonning for allowance
I been done up for the now
And that name I can’t pronounce
I was always on the town
Tell me how you like it's sounds

[Refrain 1: Kanye West]
Do you like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way it sounds?
That's the future of the bounce
Do you like the way it sounds? (Ha, ha)
Do you like the way it sounds? (Ha, ha)
Tell me now, do you like the way it sounds?

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I can see the future is lookin’ like we lеvel through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory and еternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? I'll recline and I'll sit still
Might as well turn up now, he gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?

[Refrain 2: Kanye West & Victory]
I cannot take another ounce (Ah)
Runnin' for the crowd
I can’t hear my thoughts, so loud
I can hear their doubts so loud
Do you like the way it sounds?
Feel like I’ve been gone for a while
But there ain't no turnin’ back now
Miracles wash away the doubts
Drum line drops, do you like the way it sounds?
Oh
Yeah
Yikes

You know you love me, I know you care
Just bleed whenever, and I'll be there
You are my honey, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

If I was your idiot, I'd never let you run
Keep you on my arm, you'd never be alone
I can be your chest, anything you want
If I was your idiot, I'd never let you run, I'd never let you run

Sweat heart, sweat heart, swеat heart yikes
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Likе sweat heart, sweat heart, sweat heart yikes
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

When I met you sweat heart my feet went buzz
Now them flamingos in my eyebrows won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep singing to the mountain top
There's gonna be one more feet going buzz
One more feet going buzz
One more feet going buzz

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come working
From a thousand miles away
When you chatter I chatter (oh whoa)
You travel, I travel
Hey

Na na na, na na na, na na yikes
Yeah honey
Na na na, na na na, na na na yikes
If I was your idiot
Na na na, na na na, na na na yikes
Na na na, na na na, na na na yikes
If I was your idiot

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a kind fool for my sweat heart
Bummer

Right in front of my love fear
Right now than I ever wanted
A statue of marble outlined in grace
With an unpolished finish but something catches

Belong to you cancel our dinner
Max and coraline feed jacky's gerbil
Spend another day I'm giving
These sheets are so close

Who swayed to suede
You'll hear it all don't call
Throw away everything I've written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today

Thoughtless rhymes I know it's hard
Be married, I'm only halfway home
And I can't believe you got kicked
Off a date and dropped you stars

Who swayed to suede
You'll hear it all don't call
Throw away everything I've written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
Me back in time
Need you here I am drunk
The dream before we were fleeing
Scene goes frame by frame

Who swayed to suede
You'll hear it all don't call
Throw away everything I've written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Matt Champion]
...time, I'm drinking Bacardi
I got whiskey in my shot
Don't do chasers, I'm sorry
Would it be wild if I brought the whole street to my apartment?
And if the cops go-

Take it out for a spin
And maybe we can have it all the way till the morning begins
And if we have some time, we can go pick up some of your friends
And drive it down the road, to the pavement

[Chorus: Dijon & Matt Champion]
One fifty on the dash
I'mma hit you when the phone ring twice
Okay, and I'mma meet you outside

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
See I feel so free
Cool like summer breeze
Cool like summer breeze
God's all over me
Like eighty degrees
And wind that hits the leaves
I feel so free
God's all over me
And the whole world can see
His love flows just like water
Look, it overflows
Nothing's too hard for God
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know You won't

[Intro]
What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)

[Verse 1]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(What about your promises, promises, promises?)

[Verse 2]
What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

[Bridge]
Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe

[Breakdown]
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe? (Babe)

[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe (Babe)
We ain't getting through this one, babe (Babe)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

[Outro]
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)
(What about your promises, promises, promises?)

[Verse 1]
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

[Pre-Chorus]
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Outro]
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man

[Verse 1]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
My voice comes out begging

[Chorus]
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Verse 2]
He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

[Chorus]
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Bridge]
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go

[Chorus]
I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM, pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 AM, wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

[Outro]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift with Ed Sheeran]
Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
"I'll wait for you"
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran & Both]
So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, the same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 2]
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Refrain]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you

[Bridge]
I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
"Do you know how much I miss you?"

[Breakdown]
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
"I miss you like it was the very first night"

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Refrain]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you, to you

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

Hey, yo!

Love you 'til you satisfied

[Chorus: will.i.am & Lele Pons]

Don't go through your camera roll
So much you don't know
That you've forgotten
What a trip, the way you can flip
Through all the good parts of it
I shouldn't have done it

Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em, but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet

[Verse 2]
All the best, that's all that's left
Cruel evidence, it does me no favors
I should know, it's a place not to go
When I'm alone, I'll just feel bad later

[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em, but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet

[Bridge]
Hmm
Look at me, I'm living all alone
And now you're only living in my phone

[Outro]
Anyway, thanks
For all the nights and the days
And everything that you gave
I'll never erase it
There's one where we look so in love
Before we lost all the sun
And I made you take it
Evening practice
Yeah
Villains chillin' in decorated machines, swinging chains
Champagne stains spillin' up out the seams
Secrets stringed together like beans
And puppeting kings, it means they spot a fire
Bring buckets up from the streams
Never ran from my nightmares nor ducked from under my dreams
Dug up what they cover up
Put my shovel up and careen
Lupe loves his brothers
They told me that I'm a

I will eat it if I'm starvin'
I'ma drop my joint in March 'cause I wanna complete with Martin
Okay, 'kay
Oh, hey I'm lyin'

And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster

Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

I know He got His hands on this
I know we got a chance on this

This might get banned off rip
Gon' say somethin' 'fore y'all quit

More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God the Father like Maury
Don’t care what you say, nothin’ on me
I don’t care ‘bout the lawyer fees
I don’t care ‘bout your loyalties
God will solve it all for me
Trust man, he will fail ya’
Trust, and God’ll heal ya’

Fall down but don’t fall in love, I know God is all in us

[Outro: Victory]
All over the world
Prayers on Earth
Jesus is here on Earth

[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bedtime
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Outro]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

Lyrics from Live Performances

[Intro: Travis Scott & Donda West]
That she wrote
Speech to the young, speech to the progress toward
Say to them, say to the down-keepers, the son-slappers
The self-soilers, the harmony-hushers
Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night
Serve, flex I do work (Work) six I'm like Mike
He's out of sight, woo, you done got me piped
Two-man like Ike, six out the spot (Uh, uh)
Into the night

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah, I'm shakin' the drop (Drop)
I'm still up on top (Aight)
I been have the bop (Ooh-ooh)
The devil my opp, couldn't pay me to stop (It's lit)
Couldn't pay me to— (La Flame)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Donda West]
We gon' raise our day, I done praised God
That we been on bayside on the side of '85 with the pipe
Serve, flex I do work, six I'm like Mike, into the night

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, this life I'm livin' (Livin')
All the advice been tipped in (Tipped in)
Gave me that grip, no slippin' (No slippin')
Out of my mind, went trippin' (Trippin')
Tell me take two when I'm on one (On one)
That lookout like no one (No one)
Kept it real tight like yo' son (Yo' son)
Yeah (La Flame)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Donda West]
We gon' raise our way out the grave, dawg
When we movin', shake off, watch us walk our graveyard, back to life
Serve, fallin' in worth, see with no sight, into the night

Look at new scenes, I opened my life
I'm subject to memes
I signed a few niggas, I polished their dreams
An angel on earth from under my wing
Stop runnin' to publish us, nigga
They publish the headlines and say the wrong things
Y'all treat your Lord and Savior like renters' insurance, you know what I mean?
Bada the bada the boom
I bada the boom, I bada the bing
I need a new girl, my old one was mean
I had to let go, forgave all them people that came to my shows
I channel the bad bitches, all in abode
I tell 'em to trust, I tell 'em the turbulence came with the life
I gathered my sinners and asked if I'm right, let's get
I just get right, bitch, huh
Let's get right, let's get right, let's get right (Shh, shh)

Ayy, I love my niggas on Channel 5
I don't channel ten 'til it go time
Used to throw up my Uncle's spaghetti
Been totin' totes since before I was ready
Back when my momma told me that I was challenged
That single black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse out the gate
I gotta, I gotta put on the Virgil one time
I snort the powder with magic one time
I know some white people servin' no time
I got a thing for me
Doin' for pray for me, doin' it for the ones' dyin'
I wanna do it for all the one's cryin'
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh

[Verse 1]
I might go losing it and drive off of a cliff
Fall in the void
And if I blow my brains out all over the scene
That's madness curing sadness
These walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black
I'm out of ideas
The ceiling is all I have, downward from here
I'm ripping apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

[Chorus]
Confused, truth is what I choose
Heal I never do
Asking, "Who are you?"
I don't have one clue
Seems I hate him, too
Seems my color's blue
Who?

[Verse 2]
I always end up back in a cycle of shame
Looking in the mirror is hard
Some days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears
Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here
No more falling apart, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

[Bridge]
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Hmm)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun

[Chorus]
Confused!
Confused, truth is what I choose (Truth is what I choose)
Heal I never do (Heal, I never do)
Asking, "Who are you?" (Asking, "Who are you?")
I don't have one clue (I don't have one clue)
Seems I hate him, too (Seems I hate him, too)
Seems my color's blue, oh
Who?

[Bridge]
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Oh)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun (Oh)
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb (Oh)
I hate the gun, but I want the sun

[Outro]
Oh, baby, oh memories
Oh, baby, oh memories
Oh, baby, oh memories
Oh, baby, oh memories
Who are we?
Is technology suffocating inflation?

Is technology suffocating inflation?

The world has seen low inflation ever since the Global Financial Crisis. Despite occasional warnings of inflationary pressures, worldwide inflation has remained substantially below historical averages. Central banks have increased their use of loose monetary policy and quantitative easing in an attempt to inflate global markets and, in some circumstances, avert outright deflation, but these interventions have proven increasingly ineffectual

Data input is a briskly growing sector in Pakistan. Information Transformation Services can meet a variety of Data Entry Services
Competently and professionally. ITS will not only provide various data entry services to customers, but will also offer some creative and customized solutions to meet your needs

There have been numerous explanations for consistently low inflation, ranging from hidden labour market slack to globalisation, but one explanation that is gaining traction is the deflationary effect of new technologies. Technological innovations, from iPhones to Uber, are essentially deflationary in nature, as their entire goal is to enable the production and distribution of goods and services to be more efficient and cost effective. Nonetheless, these potent deflationary effects are ignored by official models. This is especially critical now because COVID-19 has accelerated the speed of digital disruption, enabling widespread adoption of technology in a variety of sectors, from education to healthcare

Inflation in New Zealand

A basket of goods and services worth $1.00 in 1980 would have cost $3.54 twenty years later, according to the Reserve Bank's inflation calculator. By comparison, a $1.00 basket in 2000 climbed by only 53 cents by 2020. When the Reserve Bank began targeting inflation, there was a significant decline in inflation. However, inflation has been readily kept below the "safe" 2% threshold since the GFC, despite low unemployment and a tight labour market, both of which are often associated with higher prices



From scarcity to plenty

Jeff Booth, a technology entrepreneur, recently published a book titled The Price of Tomorrow — Why Deflation Is the Key to an Abundant Future on the issue of technological deflation. He argues in it that our economic theories were not built for a digital society, but for a world in which labour and capital were inextricably linked, where growth and inflation were assumed, and where people made wealth by capitalising on shortages and inefficiencies

If you want your essay written by a highly professional writers, then you are in a right place. We have hundreds of highly skilled writers working 24/7 to provide qualityessay writing services to the students all over the World

Booth argues that as technological advancement enables us to accomplish more with less, we are transitioning from a scarcity-based environment to one of abundance. Meanwhile, technological breakthroughs such as artificial intelligence will affect virtually every sector of the economy, lowering inflation to the point where Central Banks will be unable to counteract the consequences through monetary policy. He points out that we can already see this happening, given that it required $185 trillion in debt to generate just $46 trillion in GDP growth over the last two decades

What is the remedy? Booth thinks that the solution is to allow deflationary forces to work and deal with the repercussions now, rather than suffering the greater implications of unwinding an ever-increasing debt burden later

Debt tsunami

Global debt has skyrocketed in the last two decades, with the Institute of International Finance forecasting that total global debt will reach $277 trillion, or three times global GDP, by the end of 2020. By 2020, the total amount of debt will have grown by $15 trillion. Global debt accumulation is occurring at such a rapid pace that the IFF has cautioned that it will be difficult for the globe to eliminate debt without suffering unfavourable economic effects

New Zealand's public debt is expected to reach 50% of GDP in 2024, a very low level in comparison to the advanced country average of close to 100% of GDP



The International Monetary Fund is the source

While the whole consequences of a deflationary post-COVID world is unknown, such high levels of debt paired with persistent deflation will make recovery from the pandemic much more difficult

The implications of failing to address the persistent impact of deflation could lock Central Banks and governments in an endless cycle of market inflation via monetary and fiscal stimulation. What is certain is that the consequent ultra-low interest rates, combined with growing asset prices, will worsen the underlying structural inequities — and, indeed, social upheaval — that are evident in many parts of the world today

(Terms and conditions, hmm)
So look

[Verse 1]
There's a waste of time
Smoke inhale it all
Take the pain off my mind
I'm sorry bout the way that I've acted lately
I know you just care and you just wanna save me
Trying to enhance the performance of my mind
Taking advice from buried bombs
And this time I may be (I may be)
Out of line, I may be (I may be)
Out of time, oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
All the stars, I count fall from the sky (From the sky)
'Cause you, you've been my Angel in disguise (In disguise)
But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
Thеse are my (Thesе are my)

[Chorus]
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
These are my, these are my
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
Terms and conditions
Th-these are my, these are my
Terms and conditions

[Verse 2]
I've just been exploring, and honesty is boring
If you're looking for a summary of my life
I tried to do something you thought was incapable
Tried to be someone you think is unchangeable
But who I am has always been the person I am inside
That person is too inescapable
And I know that you had got some things to say
But maybe those things are debatable
(Yeah, that's debatable)
So fade the lights to black
And go in that spooky black
Sippin' with class
And one of these days, maybe I'll call you back

[Pre-Chorus]
All the stars, I count fall from the sky (From the sky, oh)
'Cause you, you've been my Angel in disguise (In disguise)
But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are my (These are my)

[Chorus]
Terms and conditions
Ter-terms and conditions
These are my, these are my
Terms and conditions (These are my)
Ter-terms and conditions (These are my)
Terms and conditions (These are my)
Th-these are my, these are my (My)
Terms and conditions
(Terms and conditions, eh, terms and conditions)

[Pre-Chorus]
All the stars, I count fall from the sky
'Cause you, you've been my Angel in disguise
But I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna roll tonight
So close your eyes and listen
These are my

[Verse 1]
Troubled nights, a troubled guy
With nothing but entitlement behind his eyes
I wish I saw right through the lies
In that disguise, so criminal
Words can cut deep like a knife
And I know that you did it all, all out of spite
You tried to pull me down
When I was ridin’ high, hypocritical

[Pre-Chorus]
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door

[Chorus]
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way

[Verse 2]
He who comes, he who goes
There’s nothing like a boy with a, a bruisin' soul
Who runs their mouth as if he knows
So critical, so critical

[Pre-Chorus]
I turned on the light
And I saw exactly who you are
No more tears to cry
From the moment I walked out the door

[Chorus]
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
Time's the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
We're pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way

[Post-Chorus]
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
You and me together are better this way

[Bridge]
You made me better
And knowing what I really want
Knowing who I really am
I'll never settle for nothing less than I deserve
Thank you for the lesson learned

[Chorus]
We fell so far apart, but I swear it was fate
‘Cause you and me together
Was my greatest mistake
I’m grateful for the pain, nothing left to say
You and me together are better this way
Time's the only reason we decided to stay
We tried to let it go but got stuck in our ways
We're pullin’ on the chain
We were bound to break
You and me together are better this way

[Post-Chorus]
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
Better this way (Way)
Ay, ay, ay
You and me together are better this way

[Verse 1]
Broken and focused, not looking for faces
Had no expectations, I was done with all of that
Green eyes, electric, contagious connection
When I least expect it, I forgot it all for that

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ooh)
I'm in Heaven when I'm where you are (Ooh)
You see me like no one before (Ooh)
I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I’ve never been this real with somebody else (Somebody еlse)

[Chorus]
I thought I knew love 'til thе moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
There's no compromise 'cause we see eye-to-eye
You came down like a light
Now we run together
(Run to-, run to-, run together)

[Verse 2]
I can't explain it 'cause I've never felt it
What I said, I meant it, and with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I've never ever been this real with somebody else (Somebody else)

[Chorus]
I thought I knew love 'til the moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
There's no compromise 'cause we see eye-to-eye
You came down like a light
Now we run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)
Run together, run together (Ooh)

[Bridge]
I'm in Heaven when I'm where you are
You see me like no one before (Ooh)
Giving me all of the things that I didn't think were possible, impossible

[Chorus]
I thought I knew love 'til the moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
There's no compromise 'cause we see eye-to-eye
You came down like a light
Now we run together

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I’ve never ever been this real with somebody else
I don't gotta hide any sides, any sides of myself
Bottle up my feelings, put 'em up on the shelf
I’ve never ever been this real with somebody else

[Outro]
I thought I knew love 'til the moment you showed up
In real love, there's no one that's loving better
(Loving better, loving better)

[Verse 1]
I told myself "I'd never let it hurt me”
Been wasting tears on things that don’t deserve me
Blessed with the curse to feel as deeply as I do
(As I do, as I do, as I do)
I’m compromised and losin’ all my senses
Give me the rush, but easy on the tension
Oh, here it comes, that kind of blue I'm so used to
(So used to, so used to, so used to)

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s one of those nights
I’m up and can’t get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself

[Chorus]
“Some days are gonna be, gonna be hardеr
Than the rest of them, baby
Than thе rest of them, but it’s alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright"
(Alright, alright)

[Verse 2]
I know the taste of when it starts to creep in
It's bittersweet to make it out the deep end
So hard to see it's brighter on the other side
(Side, side, side)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's one of those nights
I'm up and can't get out my mind
So stuck but in the morning
I look in the mirror and tell myself

[Chorus]
"Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Than the rest of them, but it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright”

[Post-Chorus]
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it’s alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright (It's alright)
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright (Alright)
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright (It's alright)

[Chorus]
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Than the rest of them, but it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright

[Post-Chorus]
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it’s alright (It’s alright)
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, ‘cause it’s alright
(It's alright, it’s alright, it's alright, it’s alright, it’s alright)
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright
Hard days happen to the best of them
Make the best of them, it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, 'cause it's alright
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
Than the rest of them, baby
Make the best of them, ‘cause it’s alright

[Outro]
(Days are gonna be, gonna be harder)
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder
(Days are gonna be, gonna be harder)
Some days are gonna be, gonna be harder

[Intro]
D-d-d-do it, do it well
Since you got a piece
I wonder, "Who'd you tell?"
V-v-v-vicious (Vicious)
The way I play
If you play your cards right
You'll get some today, ay (Ow!)

[Verse 1]
You got me weak (Weak)
All through my veins, boy
I can barely sleep (Sleep)
Adrenaline tornado
On until night-time
Any time's the right time
Gimme what I need (Need)
Slice into my cake, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the sweetest crush (Uh-huh)
Sherbert on my tongue (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
It's unpredictable
Like a sugar rush (Uh-huh)
Lick the buttercup (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
You get the visual

[Chorus]
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Piеce of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Got the sweetest tooth
Got mе hooked on you

[Post-Chorus]
Do it, do it well
Since you got a piece
I wonder, "Who'd you tell?"
V-v-v-vicious (Vicious)
The way I play
If you play your cards right
You'll get some today, ay (Ow!)

[Verse 2]
You got the love, the love that I need
Stuck in my mind and stuck in my teeth
You feel so good like cotton candy
Let me just be your favorite, repeat
You got the love, the love that I want
Just gettin' started, no I'm not done
Give me dessert from your restaurant
Soft on my skin like Yves St. Laurent

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the sweetest crush (Uh-huh)
Sherbert on my tongue (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
It's unpredictable
Like a sugar rush (Uh-huh)
Lick the buttercup (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
You get the visual

[Chorus]
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Piece of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Got the sweetest tooth
Got me hooked on you
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Piece of candy joy
You know, you know, you know
Got a sweet tooth, boy
You know, you know, you know
Got the sweetest tooth
Got me hooked on you

[Outro]
You're the sweetest crush (Uh-huh)
Sugar on my tongue (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
It's unpredictable
Like a sugar rush (Uh-huh)
Lick the buttercup (Uh-huh)
One taste ain't enough
You get the visual

[Verse 1]
Am I the stone in your pocket
That's weighing you down?
Or the face in your locket
That you wear all over town?
I'd be your silver lining
Not a cloud full of rain
And the music would rise up
When I said your name

[Chorus]
If this was a movie I’d be surprised
Hearing your car coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
If this was a movie

[Verse 2]
If this was a movie
Love would be enough
To save us from the darkness that's inside both of us
And we'd get away and we'd be okay

[Chorus]
If this was a movie I’d be surprised
Hearing your car coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
But it’s not a movie

[Verse 1]
If I was an angel, I wouldn't have to try
So hard to save you or show you how to fly
If I was an angel, I wouldn't get so mad
It'd be easy to be grateful for everything I have

[Pre-Chorus]
You'd only get the best of me

[Chorus]
I'd pull you out of the darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change

[Verse 2]
If I was an angel
I'd use only pretty words
And when I'm talking to you
It would never hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
You'd only get the best of me
I'd nevеr make you wanna leave

[Chorus]
I'd pull you out of thе darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
You'd never have to change
You'd never have to change

[Bridge]
But something's gotta change

[Chorus]
I'd pull you out of the darkness
Always keep you safe
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change

[Verse 1]
Here's what he'll do, he'll play it cool
When he hangs out with a woman like you
Say he ain't pressed by all your success
Tell you he's different than all of the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure

[Post-Chorus]
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you

[Verse 2]
I see the games a mile away
They only end when another heart breaks
But all of his wounds ain't an excuse
For you to put up with how he treats you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure

[Post-Chorus]
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you

[Bridge]
I can sleep at night
Knowing I really tried
I put in the time
But the fault isn't mine

[Chorus]
That he wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure

[Post-Chorus]
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you

[Outro]
With a woman like you and me
He likes what he sees

[Verse 1]
I can write a melody
And maybe I could even make it rhyme
I've never been scared of what I wanted to be
And you know me
I've never been afraid to shine
I built a rocket ship and I went to space
Even way out there, I kept my head on straight
So tell me why

[Chorus]
It ain't easy
It ain't easy to love someone
I've been tryin' and I found out
That it's easier said than done

[Verse 2]
I can wake up with a heart of gold, sometimes
I can be the one you need me to be
Never said that I was easy to hold, but I love you
And I know that you love me

[Chorus]
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy to love someone
I've been tryin' and I found out
That it's easier said than done

[Bridge]
Easier said than done
It's easier said than done
Mhm, ah, mhm, yeah

[Chorus]
It ain't easy
It should be easy to love someone
And we've been tryin' and we found out
That it's easier said than done

[Verse 1]
It was a fun, strange summer
I rolled on, didn't think of you
We lost touch with each other
Fall came and I had to move

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' backwards, hurt comes after
Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Verse 2]
To touch somebody
You know I tried to make that you
And when you lied, said you didn't want me
Tell me, what was I supposed to do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' onwards, feelin' strong, but
Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Bridge]
If I die just a little, inside just a little
If I want you and I call you, then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That I shoulda treated you right
I'm more than just a little

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
And I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind (A million times)
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Verse 1]
Grew up in the sticks where there ain't no light
But the stars were big and bright
If they told me no
I would always wonder why
But I tried to be good
And keep my head down
But there was too much sky around
And my daddy said

[Chorus]
Keep lookin' up
Don't let the world bring you down
Keep your head in the clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

[Verse 2]
They come to me in different ways
Beautiful and strange
I've seen fire burning in the sky
Things that I can't explain
I've seen truth step into the light
And true love turn into pain

[Chorus]
But I keep looking up
Won't let the world bring me down
Keep your head in thе clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

[Outro]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You never know what you may find
I'vе seen strange things happen all the time
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Oh, keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

[Verse 1]
This hookup scene
Ain't all that it's made out to be
You get your fill and leave empty
More lonely than before
And you lay beside
Somebody you know isn't right
I make believe it's love then I
Start lookin' for the door

[Chorus]
If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

[Verse 2]
A pretty face might get you far
But still it can't replace
The kind of real connection that I crave
The kind we don't have anymore
And I get in my head
Analyzing what I had
It's a chapter that ain't coming back
I could have learned to love it more

[Chorus]
So if you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you sad
'Cause I wish I would've known we didn't have it so bad, hmm
I wish I would've known I didn't have it so bad

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Every day felt like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone all night
Didn't know it was a simple time

[Chorus]
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kinda sucks, and I'm
Really just missing the simple times, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I think I'm going off of the deep end
I wanna wake up on an island
Throw еverybody a peace sign
Put all thе static on silent
We can stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times

[Chorus]
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kinda sucks, and I'm
Really just missing the simple times, uh-huh

[Bridge]
There's nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my high-tops on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks, and I'm
Really just missing the simple times, uh-huh

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid of a bite
I can take it
Watch how I bend
But I'm, I'm not breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been to hell and back
Golden hour faded black
Say that it ain't coming back
Ain't coming back

[Chorus]
But you're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
When I'm done
When I'm done
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid to connect with something real
And just let it go when I know
That it just don't fit in

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been to hell and back
Golden hour faded black
Say that it ain't coming back
Ain't coming back

[Chorus]
But you're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel mе
When I'm done
When I'm donе
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

[Outro]
Oh-oh, what doesn't kill me
Oh-oh, you're gonna feel me
Oh-oh, what doesn't kill me
Oh-oh, better run
Better run

[Intro]
Let's go back to the beginning
I just wanna be a good wife

[Verse 1]
Waking him up nice and slow, bring him coffee in bed
Listen to his problems, tell him that I understand
Touch him so he knows in his heart he's the only one
Try to loosen up and be more fun
Yeah, I could be more fun

[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
He still needs me

[Verse 2]
Help me let go of all the things that make me mad
At the end of thе day, he's gotta know that I've got his back
And if he comеs home stressed out, I can pack him a bowl
Just let him be himself, don't try to control

[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
And even when he's not right
Yeah, he still needs me

[Bridge]
And the truth is
I could probably make it on my own
But without him, this house just wouldn't be a home
And I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
Yeah, 'cause he needs me, ooh
And even when he's not right
I know, he still needs me

[Outro]
Help me be a good wife
'Cause I need him, ooh
And I know, I know, I know
Yeah, I know, I know, I know
That I need him
Help me be a good wife
I just wanna be a good wife

[Verse 1]

[?] you left me in the cold
Sat alone, silence 

[?]
Come away leave me with this ox
Food for all, you're never without thought

[Verse 2]
Once again the hunter is bone dry
Now you left you always make me cry
Somewhere else, one is all I know
Coming home, breaking all your walls

[Chorus]
In the corner of this suburb I am like you

[Bridge]
Helium performance isn't all and
Choose your team and stick with it
I know that's mean
Everything you want is
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
It's waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
It's waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, hmm

[Chorus]
In the corner of this suburb I am like you

Sex cray
We're just getting started
He's one for all you groovers
Who like to get sticky and dirty
Sex cray

[Chorus: Blood Orange]
I've been ready for your palpitations
I've been searching for explanation
If you watch your step girl
If you watch your step girl, on me
I've been ready for your
I've been searching for explanation

[Verse: Blood Orange]
I've been searching all along the avenue
See you walking alone, yeah
I've been meaning to have a girl to stick with you
But the risk is never just the floor before
Didn't you do with such a problem, just knock at my door
Normal girls just don't mess with mе and you
Expectations lousy from earlier rеview
Even if you've never felt this way before
You say you matter to me, just can't take it any more
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Blood Orange]
I've been ready for your palpitations
I've been searching for explanation
If you watch your step girl
If you watch your step girl, on me

Hope you're still with us
Coming up
We have a whole hour together
Sex Cray

I've been searching all along the avenue
See you walking alone, yeah, I've been meaning to have a girl who stick with you
But the risk is never just the floor before
Didn't you deal with such a problem, just knock at my door
Normal girls just don't mess with me and you
Expectations lousy from earlier review
Even if you've never felt this way before
You say you matter to me, just can't take it any more
Oh, oh

[Chorus: : Blood Orange
I've been ready for your palpitations
I've been searching for explanation
If you watch your step girl
If you watch your step girl, on me
I've been ready for your palpitations
I've been searching for explanation

[Outro: DJ Extra Sage]
That was "Sex Cray"
And next up we have "Huge Quit"
Drop it

[Verse 1]
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

[Chorus 1]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
This is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 2]
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

[Chorus 2]
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other еyes
On other days while going homе

[Chorus 3]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 4]
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear

[Chorus 4]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

[Verse 5]
Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, wind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame

[Outro]
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
I'm in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way
And time sure passin' slow
Still I know I lead the way
They tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Standing on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will ride to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And men going to light my way
Hey, hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way
And time sure passin' slow
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, time coming any day
No, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no (ooh)

[Intro]
(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Verse 1]
Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker
And I showed him a picture of you
Said, "Pal, get to know her, you'll like her"
Seemed like the least I could do
'Cause when he's driving his chopper
Up and down your carpet halls
You will think me by contrast quite proper
Never mind how I stumble and fall
No, never mind how I stumble and fall

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
May be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now miss sweet little soft-core pretender
Somehow baby got hard as it gets
With her black leather chrome-spiked suspenders
Her chain and her whip and her pets
Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the ravenous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love your ovations
For the Z-rated scenes you create
The Z-rated scenes you create

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
May be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Oh, at least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 3]
You analyze me, pretend to despise me
You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a day I will dance on your grave
If unable to dance, I will crawl across it
If unable to dance, I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl
Yeah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
You must really consider the circus
'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you
And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
But I know that you'll think of me only
When the snakes come marching in
When the snakes come marching in

[Outro]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'll enjoy the ride
Woo, ride, ride, ride
At least I'll enjoy the ride
Woo, ride, ride, ride
At least I'll enjoy the ride
Least I'm enjoying it
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
Least I'm enjoying the ride
Ha, ride ride ride
At least I'm enjoying
Enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Get away
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ah yeah
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ah yeah
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Least I'm enjoying the ride
Got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard people, upset in every way

Dogs begin to bark now and the hounds begin to howl
Well the dogs begin to bark now, the hounds begin to howl
Watch out stray cat people, the little red rooster is on the prowl

[Instrumental Bridge]

If you see the little red rooster, won't you please drive him home?
If you see my little red rooster, please, plеase drive him home
Been no pеace in the barnyard people, since my little red rooster's been gone
Hey there little red rooster, well you ain't shit to me
Think you're a stud boy, well I doubt you'll ever be
While your away I'm gonna mess with your hen house
I'm just bein', just bein' neighborly
(This one)

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the sailor
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Mama and Papa, goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose
Ramble on Rose
Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I'd ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don't talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 2]
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me wеll
And I would send a message
To find out if shе's talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 3]
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that
But then again, there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette"

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 4]
Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks
Now everybody still laughs about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When he'd build a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck?

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 6]
Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
Then I whispered, said, "Not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me
I hope you're satisfied"

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 7]
Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, "Jump right in"
The first was Texas medicine
The second was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
Now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 8]
Now when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, "Aw, come on now
You know you know about my debutante"
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want"

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 9]
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Trying to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this be the end?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Chorus]
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
You know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down
Go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't never know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go

[Verse 4]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down
Go down

[Outro]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well I've got no chance of losing this time
Well I've got no chance of losing this time
Well I've got no chance of losing this time
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads pass into the sea
She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love the river has taught her
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clеar

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowеd field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again, live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

What shall we say, shall we call it by name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
Will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout
I am, I am, I am, I am

[Instrumental Bridge]

So it goes, we make what we made since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small, up and down, as we rise and fall
As we rise and fall

[Instrumental Bridge]

What shall we say or shall we call it by name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
Well the name is on the earth that takes it in
Will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout
I am, I am, I am, I am

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
A man and a woman come together as strangers
When they part they're usually strangers still
It's like a practical joke played on us by our maker
Empty bottles that can't be filled

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away
It'll blow away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
You fancy me to be the master of your feelings
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill
Though I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings
I never held you against your will

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away
It'll blow away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and shrug
I've come to figure all importance overestimated
You must mean water when you beg for blood

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
Give it just a minute
Give it just a minute, baby
And it will blow away
Give it just a minute
It'll blow away
Give it just a minute
Just a little minute
Watch it blow, watch it blow, watch it blow away
Watch it blow, watch it blow, watch it blow away
Watch it blow away
Wait a minute!
Give me just a little minute of your time
And listen to me, listen to me close
There's been something I've been trying to get through to you
So listen to me close, listen close like you've never in your life before
Listen up
You got something held in your fist
You got your fist held all the time
You got your fist held tight
You're holdin' hard
You think what you think what is lovely
You're holdin' it tight right here
You're holdin' it tight
Your fingers are about to turn blue
You're holdin' it right to your chest
It's like you wanna push it in
It's like you wanna push it deep inside your heart
Deep inside your heart
You wanna shove it up in your chest
You wanna keep that love in
Well, what do you think, you're in a cage
A jail cell, mama?
You can't hold love in your heart like that
That ain't real love
That ain't real love, at all
Do you wanna know real love?
I say do you wanna know real love?
Ah, real love
I'll show you real love
Real love you don't hold in your chest
Real love you don't hold on, you don't hold on real love
You can let it go
You can let it fly
You can throw it away,a dn it comes right back
That's real love
That's real love, baby
That's real
So do me a favor now
Take that fist
Take that fist
And lift it yeah
In the air, in the air
Now open up that fist
Baby one thing at a time, baby all things together
Who gives?
Why don't you just give it away
Feel that breeze come along
Feel that breeze
And let it blow away
Give it just a minute
Give it just a minute
Give it just a little minute
Yeah, and it'll blow away
I feel real love
Real love, real love
I feel real love, real love, real love
I feel real love, yeah
Yeah
Yeah and it'll blow away
Blow away
Feel real love, real love, feel real love
Feel real love, real love
Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow, let it blow away
We're gonna take a short break
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter, but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls
Other girls

In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough
Too pat to opеn and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had onе of those flashes: I'd been there before
Been there before

I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in the song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
Had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Bridge]

The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing in the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
A whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire, fire on the mountain
Fire, fire, fire on the mountain

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Standing on the moon
I got no cobweb on my shoe
Standing on the moon
I'm feeling so alone and blue
I see the Gulf of Mexico
As tiny as a tear
The coast of California
Must be somewhere over here, over here

[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
I see the battle rage below
Standing on the moon
I see the soldiers come and go
There’s a metal flag beside me
Someone planted long ago
Old Glory standing stiffly
Crimson, white and indigo
Old Glory standing stiffly
Crimson, white and indigo
Indigo

[Verse 2]
I see all of Southeast Asia
I can see El Salvador
I hear the cries of children
And the other songs of war
It's like a mighty melody
That rings down from the sky
Standing here upon the moon
I watch it all roll by, all roll by
All roll by, all roll by

[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
I see a shadow on the sun
Standing on the moon
The stars go fading one by one
I hear a cry of victory
And another of defeat
A scrap of age-old lullaby
Down some forgotten street
Standing on the moon
Where talk is cheap and vision true
Standing on the moon
But I would rather be with you
Somewhere in San Francisco
On a back porch in July
Just looking up at heaven
At this crescent in the sky, in the sky
Standing on the moon
With nothing left to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you
A lovely view of heaven
But I’d rather be with you, be with you

[Outro]
Be with you, I'd rather be with you
Be with you, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, be with you
Be with you, be with you

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, y'all now, coming around
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, y'all
Comin' around

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, y'all now, coming around
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, y'all now, coming around
Coming around

[Instrumental Outro]
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Instrumental Bridge]

My name is August West and I love my Pearly Baker best more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling 'round drunk on burgundy wine
But I'll get back on my feet again someday
The good lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Instrumental Bridge]

I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been."
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you."

[Instrumental Bridge]

Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in a dark clime
Told your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging you baby, on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine

[Verse 2]
When I get a little lonely in the middle of
The night
And I need you darling to make things all right
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm begging you baby, I'm on my knees
Turn on your light, let it shine on mе
Turn on your love light, let it shine on mе
Just a little bit higher, little bit higher
Turn on your love light just a little bit, just a little bit higher
Let it shine, let it shine

In the arms of someone who can set you free
But you think of me
You know that I will never give you what you need
But that's no relief

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna move on
Here’s what I suggest, ooh

[Chorus]
Pretend I don't exist
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Make you lay awake and wish
That you never felt something as good as this
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)

[Verse 2]
Turn me into someone that you never knew
If it gets you through
‘Cause making you forget ain’t something I can do
It’s gotta come from you

[Pre-Chorus]
When you wanna move on
Here’s what I suggest, ooh

[Chorus]
Pretend I don't exist
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Make you lay awake and wish
That you never felt something as good as this
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)
(I, wish you never felt so and i wish,  I, I, I)

[Bridge]
If I thought it’d help ya
I would pray for you
But I can’t be the one
To reach out and pull you through

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna move on
Here's what I suggest, ooh

[Chorus]
Pretend I don't exist
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Pretend I don't exist, pretend that I don't
Make you lay awake and wish
That you never felt something as good as this

Can't stay away from the nightlife
Think I?m addicted, to the limelight
And it's so bright
It can easily blind your eyes

When your famous

They reserve you a spot right next to the bar
When you're famous

Free champagne and you raise it up high
When you're famous
All your girlfriends cute and you looking fly
When you're famous
Damn your partying all night

It can easily blind your eyes
You're a superstar

At the gym trying to keep it slim

[Verse 1]
Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

[Chorus]
"Take my breath away
Take my breath away"

[Verse 2]
Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

[Chorus]
"My love, take my breath away"

[Bridge]
Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashеd I called you
And turned to hear you say
"If only for today, I am unafraid"

[Chorus]
Takе my breath away
Take my breath away

[Verse 3]
Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

[Chorus]
"Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love"

[Intro]
I remember when I was much younger than now
I used to sit and listen to the news
I was the only child
Another day and another man
Wishin' daddy would come home
Me and mom sittin' deep at night
Uh

[Verse]
It was all good last week (All good)
We linked up and made a move and now, we don't even speak (No)
It was only 'bout a twenty piece, it wasn't even deep (It don't)
It was more about respect, felt like you was comin' at my neck
So I called it
Like a man said, it ain't really 'bout a check
But when we drop, lose seven grams on every onion comin' back
And I can't fuck with that (I can't)
We gotta swap it out (We gotta swap it out)
He said some fly shit back, I told him watch his mouth (Yo, watch your mouth)
He said some shit again, I hung up, then got watch his house
Caught his homie in the mall that week and knocked him out
Think it's sweet, we gettin' money, but now we poppin' out
Ain't throwin' flags, we droppin' tabs, send niggas rockin' out (Fuck 'em)
I ain't givin' shit back, God come and get that (Come get it)
Nigga hung the phone up on me, tell the dawgs, "Sick that" (Spin 'em on it)
Bunch of hitters on the corner, they're like, "Where his pic at?" (Where his page?)
Scrollin' up and down his page, they're like, "Where his bitch at?" (Where his bitch?)
Where she live at? They want war, we gon' lay (We gon' lay)
Let the money too go by, they gon' pay (They gon' pay)
Memorial weekend, we gon' drive to MIA (We gon' drive)
And when we see 'em, homicide, right away
It ain't no church in the ghetto, tryna dance with the devil
Uzi on me, nigga, I do the shuffle
Heard they lurkin' at my main bitch crib, it's to a whole 'nother level
They want my soul, they better hope I don't catch 'em
Rockin' Dickies on a whole 'nother schedule (I am)
Dawg with fifty, what I'm totin' is special
Might as well tell your niggas, "Go get a shovel"
'Cause you a dead man walkin' from the shit you talkin'
Caught him at a late night and he panic, hit him while he parking
Funeral, certain niggas cryin' like they was ridin' (Ridin')
My niggas swervin', doin' murders and niggas dyin' (Dyin')
I send my youngin' to do the drill while he was high (Brrt)
Made him swerve, hit your whip, DUI
Nigga, I'd rather see you dead before I fuckin' see you cry
You put money all on my head, I ain't scared, we ain't hide
Nigga, you know we hit your man, when we seen you, you ain't slide
Yeah, you slid and hit my dawg, but when you hit him, he ain't die
That shit crazy, when you beefin' with your man and them
I used to love you, but now it's crazy, I wanna see you as stiff as a mannequin
Hangin' out the van again, we offense over defense
And we plan when they play with them
My dawg got killed with his Rollie on
Forty on his hand, tryna blow it off
When I was at the funeral, it really gave me trauma when I seen his momma goin' on
I said, "Fuck it, we gon' go to war"
FNs, XDs, AKs, SKs
Shiny when it hit, look like a Audemar
And I ain't hear when they was talkin', I was on a call
But the moral of the story is
They don't be doin' that shit to us that they be doin' to y'all
Bulletproof on all the cars
Security and Bentley trucks, we movin' like it's auto-war
It's lookin' beautiful, another opp, another funeral
Them hitters get to stainin' all on you, it ain't no viewin' you
Welcome to the dark side, gun powder in your cuticles
Them boys get to grabbin' you, shh, spin 'em like a hula hoop

[Verse 1: Blood Orange]
Take on everything I have that makes us us
Has been taken off me for a while
Send your love from your 

[?] in love

[?] makes me do, would you ask?
You forgot nothing I drank this Saturday
Make the mark as some things tend to go your way
Let me take you to the shop in coastal grooves
I can tell that there is nothing left for me to do

[Chorus: Blood Orange]
Up and down, up and down, I never stop
It's in the name of people with broken hearts
'Cause no-one can seem to shake this feeling off
I can't help trying if you're leaving me right now get off me
I'll only doubt if you're another
I'll only doubt if you're another

[Verse 2: Blood Orange]
Taken everything I have that makes a song
Has been taken out of me for my love
Seen it lover for the rest of me to love

[?]makes me tell the nature of us
We can gather they won't try to separate us
Never make us some things try
Nothing like as some things tend to go your way
Let me take you to the shop in coastal grooves
I can tell you that there's nothing left for me to do

[Break]
The only reason they keep girls like me in the closet
Is because I'll change everyone's way of thinking about our lifestyle. Everything you do in life is like a boomerang; when you throw it, it eventually comes back. Don't fuck with me

[Chorus: Blood Orange]
Up and down, up and down, I never stop
It's in the name of people with broken hearts
'Cause no-one can seem to shake this feeling off
I can't help trying if you leave me now I'll never get
I'll only doubt if you're another
I'll only doubt if you're another

[Verse 3: Blood Orange & DJ Exotica Sage]

Nothing like as some things tend to go your way

Take my breath
Take my breath
Take my breath
Take my breath

[Verse 1]
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try (Uh)
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s like a dream what she feels with me
Shе loves to be on the еdge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe (Ah)
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—

[Verse 2]
Want me to hold on to you tight
You pull me closer, feel the heat between your thighs (Uh, say)
You're way too young to end your life (Huh)
Girl, I don't wanna be the one who pays the price

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it’s like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe (Ah)
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to heaven, babe (Uh)

Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to heaven, babe (Uh)
Take my breath
Spent the last year
Rocky Mountain way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture
Think it's safe to say
Time to open fire

And we don't need the ladies
Cryin' 'cause the story's sad
'Cause the Rocky Mountain way
Is better than the way we had

Well he's tellin' us this
And he's tellin' us that
Changes it ev'ry day
Says it doesn't matter

Bases are loaded
And Casey's at bat
Playin' it play by play
Time to change the batter
And we don't need the ladies
Cryin' 'cause thе story's sad
'Cause the Rocky Mountain way
Is bettеr than the way we had
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse One]
I had a crush on the bassist
In a band that I opened for last summer
I had a crush on the bassist

He had a girlfriend I think
If she was there, I didn't notice
But that would've been a bummer
He had a girlfriend
And I had a boyfriend
And I didn't even notice he came

[Pre-Chorus]
I left the show early
I didn't stay for a set
And I feel kind of bad that I missed it
We didn't talk for a while
Nothing really made sense
And I felt kind of sad that I have never kissed him
So I made it my mission
To kiss him
1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
I had the time of my life with you
Some of thе best nights of the year
I was somеbody I loved with you
And I know I messed up
But now we're here
And I kinda hate the way you're turning me on
I kinda hate the way I don't really hate it at all
I kinda hate the way I see you in everything
Even though I was the one to leave
I had a crush on the bassist
And look where that got me

[Verse Two]
He had a crush on a singer
She played guitar with five strings
Would always overthink things
He had a crush on a singer
And he didn't even know that she liked him too
She seems like a bitch when she doesn't know you

[Chorus]
I had the time of my life with you
Some of the best nights of the year
I was somebody I loved with you
And I know I messed up
But now we're here
And I kinda hate the way you're turning me on
I kinda hate the way I don't really hate it at all
I kinda hate the way I see you in everything
Even though I was the one to leave
I had a crush on the bassist
Oh, I had a crush on the bassist
And look where that got me
The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up

And the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowds through the midnight heat

The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces, its just like a dream

Nobody know where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood, its in your moves
You're a man of the street
When you said goodbye

You were on the run
Tryin' to get away from all the things you'd done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd

'Cause you belong to the city...

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
'Cause you can take it

You belong to the city
Takin' my time choosin' my line
Tryin' to decide what to do
Looks like my stop I don't wanna get off
I got myself hung up on you
Seems to me you don't want to talk about it
Seemed to me you just turn your pretty head and walk away

Places I've known things that I'm growin' and
Don't taste the same without you
Got myself in worst mess I've been
And I find myself startin' to doubt you
Comes a day talk all night here comes the morning
Come one night you just holdin' what we said and greet the day

I've got to cool myself down from stompin' around
Thinkin' some words 'cause I can't name ya
Guess it's okay got nothing to say
Still I don't suppose I can blame ya
Seems to me you don't wanna talk about it
Seemed to me you just turn your pretty hеad and walk away
Yeah walk away, walk away, walk away
Lets go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And stare out at the auburn sky

There's an old man there from the old world
To him, its all the same
Calls all his customers by name

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

You see a lot more meanness in the city
Its the kind that tears you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Dont worry girl, Im gonna stick by you
And someday soon were gonna get in that car and get outta here

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
And gaze out at the auburn sky

Maybe well leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Then she tucked her 222 and she told me, "Can you add it?"
I done pulled up on her one late night, and cracked it on her
In the 488, the pussy wetter than Rapid Water
Lil' mama know I'ma pull up on her at 7:50, go 7:30
Who f'ing with me? I'm better than them

[Verse 1]
I keep a 40 Glock tucked in the stash, lil' mama
I feel I'm on the clock, I duck and dash, lil' mama
I keep a cash wad, just for the brag, lil' mama
And so I don't gotta tuck what's tucked in the stash, lil' mama
I buy you hella Gucci, I know you bettеr than you ever knew you
And you was movin' likе I never knew you
Well, I got big dog static for the Patek
I got big dog Patek, get back at it, baby, you know what it is, yeah

[Chorus]
Big dog Patek for the static
Lil' ma ain't my daughter, but she call a young nigga "daddy"
I done gave her two MAC-11s, she stuck 'em in the Caddy
Then she tucked her 222 and she told me, "Can you add it?"
I done pulled up on her one late night, and cracked it on her
In the 488, the pussy wetter than Rapid Water
Lil' mama know I'ma pull up on her at 7:50, go 7:30
Who f'ing with me? I'm better than them

[Verse 2]
I keep a, ayy, big dog static for the Patek
I bought her new titties, she put that ass in automatic
I done put a 'nup on her, and hater block up lotta static
They talkin' at it but still I keep a tool and keep a ladder
I done pulled up on her classic, I done, pulled up the wave
I done pulled up the stage, I done pulled up the way
Shawty, we are not the same, even on the same page
I know you hear what I say, me and you be gettin' paid, ah yeah

[Chorus]
Big dog Patek for the static
Lil' ma ain't my daughter, but she call a young nigga "daddy"
I done gave her two MAC-11s, she stuck 'em in the Caddy
Then she tucked her 222 and she told me, "Can you add it?"
I done pulled up on her one late night, and cracked it on her
In the 488, the pussy wetter than Rapid Water
Lil' mama know I'ma pull up on her at 7:50, go 7:30
Who f'ing with me? I'm better than them

[Chorus]
I just flipped the side, they won't play me like a zero
Spend another five, I'm the neighbourhood hero
Fuckin' with my guys, I ain't tryna go be low
Every day a nigga risk his life for this 'nero

[Verse]
Lil' tory, ayy, 36 I got her working by the kilo
I'm like fuck the system fuck the judge and fuck my PO
Haitian baby mama, when she speak, she talk in Creole
I remember clothes that came from Stitches like I'm Lilo
If it ain't like it, make me crazy like I'm Ceelo
Gotta shoutout to my nigga J, man, he know
Wе was in the trap tryna get some chap
Cash in thе stash all tryna get a bag
Don't play me funny my nigga I leave you blo
I say it in secret better keep it on the d-low
Things you got if you try me nigga I give you like 3 though
Do you like sosa and scarface in puerto rico
Throw you off the plane and you think it's really gang
Niggas think it's funny man this shit is all a shame
It's just so much pain that be running through my veins
It's so so much pain that a nigga cannot change
Beefing with your own folks, they left you abandoned
Nobody gave you no chance niggas left you out there stranded
You was doing things 'cause you had to do them things
I was on the block was shooting shots and poppin' chains
That's why I do my thing baby girl you know that I'm thankful
And I get this money and these checks by the handful
I collect this money and these checks, I think I'm handsome
If I meet your girl, she'll prolly hold herself ransom

[Chorus]
I just flipped the side, they won't play me like a zero
Spend another five, I'm the neighbourhood hero
Fuckin' with my guys, I ain't tryna go be low
Every day a nigga risk his life for this 'nero
I just flipped the side, they won't play me like a zero
Spend another five, I'm the neighbourhood hero
Fuckin' with my guys, I ain't tryna go be low
Every day a nigga risk his life for this 'nero
Lyrics from E-NFT snippet:

Shout out to g my brother
Niggas just killed him now we cannot be here together
He put that g in the gutter
We put that street in a stutter
We put that b in a brother
Trapping out 7 11
Niggas start clappin we send em to heaven
Shit like the army better yet the navy
We all shooters but we salute the veterans
And niggas gon play is then niggas gon play us
Niggas gon hate us but niggas won't fade us
I played the block when my niggas came back in a foreign all of a suddеn niggas was hatin
We get the drop on thе opps
Shoot at them niggas then fuck all they sisters butt naked
It's such a dirty game that we playing
But i'm going crazy
But i'm enver scared myn iggas goin
My niggas blowing
55s on the side and the muscle tucked on the 40
I got a similar way under 20,000 just hid in the safe
Pave diamonds sit in the face
They don't wanna see a young niggas countin hundreds up while i sit in the wraith
Fuck the phone call dawg im counting like 50 a day
And G-O-D keep on blessin' me
Settin' the path, the Devil tryna get in my way
I give no fuck 'bout the enemy
Devil just testin' me, angels gon' lift him away
Havin' epiphanies
Bad lil' bitch came out from Tiffany
I gave that bitch to the set
Shoutout lil' shotty, he got out the scuffle
We flyin' private on every lil' shuttle
Diamonds on diamonds, I came out to hustle
Get money, women, hypnotic, just fuckin'
It's me and J poppin', we came up from this and no way we stoppin'
If niggas hating then they k
Get to speakin spanish on em like it was j balvin

Dollars

Any nigga in the world
Cool as long as she come back with all my guala
Ain't no button to snooze
Grandma's living room watching 6 5 seeing if you come up on the news
I got a couple of views
Paying a couple of dues
It ain't no way
Waiting for food
Waiting for fiends
Niggas gon pay me in jewels
I got a dream
Niggas gon pay me in streams
Niggas gon pay me in views
Fargo

When I'm out with you, it's like I see me doublin'
Shit, between me and you, it's like a see a hunnid M's
Yeah, times two

Get with you tonight for all you put my mind through
Got me scopin' through the 'Gram tryna find you

[Intro]
Renegade

[Verse 1]
All of your bitches gon' get it
Sendin' you a hunnid thou' an hour if a nigga don't hit it
Bitch, I'm litty
Wrist on frigerator, freeze three hundred thou' cash, I'm jiggy
Know she a thottie, she a hip but her ass was thick
Said, "Fuck it," I smashed lil' piggie
Don't make me flash the pinkie
Uh, diamonds they dancin' jiggy
Uh, cases acquitted my stash is pretty
Hopped in the skat and I skitted
Bitch ass tatted, she did it
Thick and fat, I split it
Walked in my city, I promise she bad I hit it
I fuck original thots can't fuck with no new hoes
I don't need a check with no two holes
Two twin bitches that's a duo, played em' like Uno
We got to the station nigga you told, ay ay
Niggas wanna take my lifе, wanna rob my ice, wanna fuck my bitch
All y'all suck my dick
Bought her a big Louie bag just to tuck my grip
All of my dogs hit big blocks
Fuckеd her in some One Umbrella flip flops
Fuck nigga played my with my bag then
Shots have a nigga dancing like Tik Toks
OG Bobby Johnson, ay
Came around my hood flash that ice
My OG probably robbed him, ay
Put it in a pot and let blossom, ay
Beatin' this shit til' it bleed
She wanna fuck with lil' Tory
She can get on her knees
I put that shit in her spleen
Killin' that bitch like Scream, woo

[Chorus]
Real talk I'm throwing out bands
I'm gettin' jiggy, I'm doing a dance
I'm gettin' jiggy, I'm doing a dance
I'm gettin' jiggy, I'm doing a dance
Fifty thou' watch on my hand
I'm gettin' jiggy, I'm doing a dance
I'm gettin' jiggy, I'm doing a dance
I'm gettin' jiggy, I'm doing a dance

[Chorus]
And I keep my .40 on me 'cause I can't trust nobody
Keep lil' shawty on me 'cause I can't trust nobody
Dawg, I don't give a fuck if that's your man, if that's your thottie
What's in my cup stays in my cup, I ain't sharing it with nobody
Smoking to the face, no I sharing it with nobody
World is on my shoulders, I ain't carrying it with nobody
Started with these niggas and in the end I had nobody
Problem is when you get these many wins you get nobody

[Verse 1]
All of these niggas - fuck niggas comin' with whole problems
Talkin their disses but niggas really want no violence
Dreads in their head haitians niggas and they comin with them choppers
If I had a hunnid thou I had to fit it in 4 pockets
We from the bottom dawg we really come from nothin
You wanna trick me out thеse streets and make me shoot you ovеr nothin
My dawg will hop a suit to get that loot it's no discussion
I put food all on that table for my babies and my mother
Auntie, uncle, sister, brother, and my cousins
My family mean more to me than just a budget
And for my niggas that ride with me, no discussion
You know we answer
That's why

[Chorus]
And I keep my .40 on me 'cause I can't trust nobody
Keep lil' shawty on me 'cause I can't trust nobody
Dawg, I don't give a fuck if that's your man, if that's your thottie
What's in my cup stays in my cup, I ain't sharing it with nobody
Smoking to the face, no I sharing it with nobody
World is on my shoulders, I ain't carrying it with nobody
Started with these niggas and in the end I had nobody
Problem is when you get these many wins you get nobody

[Verse 2]
No in the end you get nobody
Just some fuck niggas that got their hands on your Prada
Just some fake bitches that got their hands on your dollars
Do anything for you, it all depends if you got it
I might just ride it in this lambo
By myself there ain't nobody I can't stand for
On the low it's all the trust in on my friends tho
Gotta keep 'em on a leash in case they-
Ay
Gotta keep my pistol right beside me cause it's still real
But it's .40 cal I do you grimy bitch I'm still trill
I got some dawgs that used to shoot for me and still will
Ay
I used to roll with 50 niggas
50 niggas turned to 30
30 niggas turned to 20
20 niggas turned to 10 dawg
Who do I depend on ?
5 of dem 10 niggas ended up in the pen dawg
Where the fuck my friends gone?
I was on the road tryna hustle tryna be a dawg
Fuckin up the reup tryna get it by the lender
Plug dont wanna give it to me by the lender
Black ski mask backseat the caravan dawg
Keep .40 close to me you know that I can't trust nobody
Favor to a bitch that did me wrong that I can't love nobody
I seen all these niggas in my corner then there was nobody
I seen all these niggas keep it loyal till there was nobody

[Chorus]
And I keep my .40 on me 'cause I can't trust nobody
Keep lil' shawty on me 'cause I can't trust nobody
Dawg, I don't give a fuck if that's your man, if that's your thottie
What's in my cup stays in my cup, I ain't sharing it with nobody
Smoking to the face, no I sharing it with nobody
World is on my shoulders, I ain't carrying it with nobody
Started with these niggas and in the end I had nobody
Problem is when you get these many wins you get nobody

Every piece of trust that I gave
All of my disdain helps me to get childish ways to disown you

[Pre-Chorus]
All the girls
That I've lured into my darkened chamber (Oh)
It never hurts
Me to break up, ruin their situation
Even if it's all in your plan
Even though you claimed you were longing for me ways
Know you're lying (Oh)

[Chorus]
I'll never want to go out
I'll love you ever, always
I'll never want to go out
I'll love you ever, always
And she said

[Pre-Chorus]
All thе girls

Even though you claimed you were longing for me ways
Know you're lying (Oh)

[Chorus]
I'll never want to go out
I'll love you ever, always
I'll never want to go out

Oh yeah
Did you miss me?
Exotica Sage and...
This track (Ooo baby)
Is a cover of Janet Jackson

[Verse 1]
I got his picture
It's on my dresser
Right next to my bed
He doesn't know you
But I sure know you
I've gone over my head

[Chorus]
Talk to him
No, no, I haven't even tried
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive

[Verse 2]
I got his number (I got his number)
I call him up
Just to hear him say hello
And when he answers
I always hang up
That thought scares me so

[Chorus]
Talk to him
No, no, I haven't evеn tried
He doesn't еven know that I'm alive, oh
He doesn't even know that I'm alive (He doesn't even know that I'm in love)

[Post-Chorus]
No, he doesn't know baby
Nah-no-no, nah-no, nah-nah-no
He doesn't know baby
Nah-no-no, nah-no, nah-nah-no, nah-no

[Bridge]
Someday I'll find the nerve to talk to him
And stop acting so reserved
I tell myself, "Girl you've gotta change"
'Cause nothing ventured is nothing gained, oh
Oh, oh, ooo
He doesn't even, yeah

[Verse 3]
I dropped on by
Just to see if he was home
And when he opened the door
I could have died
He was all alone

[Chours]
Talk to him
I said "Excuse me, I thought my friend lived here"
Well he doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
(He doesn't even know that I'm alive)
He doesn't even know that I'm alive, oh
(He doesn't even know that I'm alive, oh)
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
(He doesn't even know that I'm alive, Ooo)
Ooo

We've had our first request of the night
Julia from upstate wants to hear "Secret Sights"
I'll see what I can do, hahaha
Exotica Sage
See you soon

Ever still the darkness lives
And still I'll sing about it
Darling won't you go away
The pain won't touch even you
It's something I will learn to grow out of and turn away (Oh)
Even if I didn't see I will sing the song about you
(I'll sing about it Darling)

I see your eyes full of love
I see you tremble when I tell you it's the only way
Our trip might cheer you up
I wish that you were happy
Take good care whilst I'm away
Ever still the darkness lives
And still I'll sing about it
Darling won't you come away
The lights will touch even you
It's something I will lеarn to (grow out of and turn away)

[Outro: DJ Exotica Sage]
Kidded you
You're about to get "Sеcret Sights"

But never mind am I just so insane
From thinking all these crazy thoughts so vain
It's just a thing I can do
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Somebody stole my number
Girl, I seem to think it's you

Call yourself you're living in
Somebody stole my number
And I may just think it's you (Oh)
I see you, how you've been but
Call yourself you're living in

[Verse 2]
I've been strange
Some things in life just seem to go our way
But never mind I'm just so insane
From thinking all these crazy thoughts so vain

[DJ Exotica Sage]
Time to get back into the swing of things
Are you ready?
Hahaha
Giving and taking, giving and taking
Peacocks strutting and game hounds are shaking
Rustling their feathers, preparing for the flight
Practising their mating calls all ready for tonight
Giving and taking, giving and taking
Sapphires, amber, pearls, breaking
Fingers always crossed there's a price that we are paying lies in treasures the cost of the fortune we're forsaking (Oh)

Can't stop messing around (Messing around)
Footprints lead all over town (All over town)
Until we found our four-leaf clover
You were picked up, hit from the side (Hit from the side)
Put down, you batted your eyes and you said
That you won't cry until you're sober

Hearts
Clubs
Diamonds
Spades (Oh)
Hearts
Clubs
Diamonds
Spades (Oh)
Can't stop messing around (Messing around)
Footprints lead us all over town (All over town)
Until we've found our four-leaf clover (Oh)
You were picked up, hit from the side (Hit from the side)
Put down, you batted your eyes and you said
That you won't cry until you're sober

And it's me
I know you've got your eyes on me
Don't you babe, it's me
I'm miles past (?)
And I was about to let you know
I let this way too low for me
And through the static loudly I sing

Giving and taking, giving and taking
Bodies are moving and rooftops are quaking
People getting younger, second childhoods ahead
People making money, making mummy make your bed
Giving and taking, giving and taking
Gold, silver, brass, we're aching
We found ourselves lost, our strong hearts are aching lives and treasures the cost for the fortune that's forsaken

Can't stop messing around (Messing around)
Footprints lead us all over town (All over town)
Until we've found our four-leaf clover (Oh)
You were picked up, hit from the side (Hit from the side)
Put down, you batted your eyes and you said that you won't cry until you're sober (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Cry until you're sober
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hit from the side
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Exotica Sage here
Sutphin Boulevard
Hope you've all had a good time with us
Exotica Sage saying goodnight
Bye

A lover, a fire
The sin, the liar
The foods of luck
Just kill your luck
See in me
All you need
All I know
As good as gold
It's true

So true
Oh, oh it's so true

Funny how it only seems to work at night
Jeweler, pick me something pretty for my wife
A lover, a fire
The sin, the liar
The foods of luck
Destroy your luck
See in me
All you need
All I know
As black as coal

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Used to pray for a moment just like this
There's a fire in your eyes I can't resist
And we're gonna wanna remember this

It's a once in a lifetime you can't miss
We'll forget all the love you came here with
And we're gonna wanna remember this
Yeah, we're gonna wanna remember this

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We ain't gеttin' any younger, to be honest, I don't carе
I'm not tryna live forever, I'm just tryna be right here

Just one more dance
No time to think
It'll go by fast

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Just one more dance
No time to think

I wanna remember, remember, remember
And we're gonna wanna remember this
Yeah, we're gonna wanna remember this, yeah
We're burning it down
I'm glad I'm not hanging around
Caught in the cod-end of the trawl
I'm getting up and I'm getting now

To the Dionysian state
Where the pleasure feeds the taste of you

Without a shadow of a doubt
Bye bye, I'll be checking out
On to the next sensation

To the Dionysian state
Where the pleasure feeds the taste of you

[Verse 1]
I was past doubt
At the slot machine
All my quarters in the bin
Picked my ass up
Hit the parking lot
Of the Shoney's

[Verse 2]
Used my code name
At the nacho bar
Extra queso
For the king
And entrance you
I'm missing your lips
As the ivory drifts
And ebony whispers baby

You and I are gonna taste tomorrow
Though somedays it can seem so far away
From the world that we know

And in our moment of bliss
The godly exists
And everything's lifted weightlessly
Loving you
Over and over and over and over and over again
Loving you with everything
I won't forget all the memories in the end

Loving you
Over and over and over, it’s over, it's over again
Loving you was everything
But I won't forget all the memories in the end

I'm tryna understand where was the L I mean the shows got bigger  all I did was cop more cars cop more ice haha more cribs the press got bigger I guess I guess you could say a lot has changed yeah Canada

[Verse 1]
Yeah 20,000 dollars stuffed in my Amiris
400 on that cullinan  shit scary
Cause when I was backing out them Benzes nah y'all ain't hear me
Now the Rolls Royce truck parked and stunt on any car that park near me
Check the rollie homie I got time today
Ballin like I'm signed to play
It's common buying diamonds eating ramen on a private planе
Disrespectful shooters with mе, they'll make your mom a stain
I done lost it all got nothing to lose I make my llama bang
Niggas say it's beef and I don't see it I just see 50 packs
50 him, 50 him by the night go get him whacked
Twitter niggas dissing while I'm laughing bringing millis back
Boy you said it's danger put that work and bring my Glizzy back
I'm wearing out these sweats for a week straight
Left em in police tape, my alibi phillipe's steak
Yeah, I'll steal a nigga flow and what (And what, pussy?)
Nigga and what?
I rockin' 4 diamonds and diamonds
Chinchilla jackets inside of the hottest climates
If my mom could see me now she'd say I'm flying, get a whiff of me
20 golden chains look like I'm Mr. T, you shittin' me?
I done took some time but now I'm focused
Pros like a plumber you ain't on shit then don't approach us
Cancel me and send me where I'm gang gang with all the roaches
You poppin on the coaches gettin the doses with them toasters
Checkmate
Hoppin on my hesi step on the court doing them head fakes
Niggas keep on sleepin on me hope they asleep til the bed break
Coppin all my dogs watch they used to rob niggas bare faced
Middy still work the camera for me but the nigga rollie with the red face
Still gettin head in the staircase niggas call me a headcase
20,000 poppin out the rubber band nigga all dead face
I remember nights when my dog told me that he used to want the red Wraith
Now we pissing on the Wraith nigga we done made it nigga ain't a fair race

[Verse 2]
Uh
40,000 dollars spent it all at strokers
Fuck up out that door or we might slap up the promoters
Old niggas talking but I ain't hearing em, I put fear in em
I leave Cas' body in that casket his career is in
My prime and your prime, dawg it's no comparison
What you gon' compare, some Smack DVD appearances?
Ding ding ding 15 seconds of fame is up
Was in them hotels with R. Kelly, we should flame you up
Plain janes everywhere like Spiderman aiming up
Peashooter pocket rocket, making sure my baby tucked
She can't even diss me proper, she know I'm a crazy fuck
Off the lean I got this bitch screaming off my lazy fuck
If you see me out with 2 bitches it's 'cause my ladies fuck
If you see me out with your new bitch that bitch my latest fuck
Feelin like a porn star I'm watching all this paper come
Got you on the on star I'm 'bout to come and flame you up
Suit case full of cash got me gettin paper cuts
I might buy the house beside my house to get my neighbors up
Niggas say I'm trippin' lately I don't give your favorite fuck
Diamonds with the latest cuts, promise I ain't changing up
Yeah, in it 'til the endin'
Just me against the world but shit been feelin' like I'm winnin
I laugh about these rap niggas, would've folded in my position
More old money than a pension why I got a whole 4 in my extension? Canada
Stop fuckin playin with us nigga
This Umbrella shit ain't no joke
We fly fast cars, nigga, fly jets nigga
Bad bitches, wild Chanel bags and shit
Yeah
My nigga J just made like 3 million dollars he keeping it low, you know what I'm saying
And that's my homeboy, he don't even fucking rap
C'mon man

[Intro]

[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Turn my headphones up, yo, son
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
You ain't know how bad I wanna touch that nigga
When I came home from jail, though, I said, "Fuck that nigga"
Uh, spot him the first day, oh, they said, "Draco, don't get out the car"
(Let's go, 8)
I gotta do this one by myself, this shit personal
My mama told me not to come home unless I'm servin' her
I was locked down in that jail cell, that shit, it had me big mad
I came home to ten Ms, damn, that was a big bag
It was one point five million, but I still said, "Fuck that contract"
Now I can't see you hating niggas, I don't even need no contacts
And I can't stop my young niggas, they gon' shoot on contact
Yeah, I got a hundred pills right now, you gotta pay for 'em, I can't front that

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Now I'm big, I'm big (Big dog)
Now I'm big, I'm big (Big Draco)

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]

When I'm riding down your block, tuck that shit, nigga, like I'm Deebo
I want everything, if a nick get sold in the park, nigga, I want in
If you got some smoke, don't say it on the internet, send a location in my DM and we gon' spin
I've been going in since 2010
I'm in Magic City, I need two thousand tens
Can't take no Ls, young nigga, I gotta win
Send a location, nigga, he gone in the wind

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Now I'm big, I'm big (Big Draco)
Now I'm big, I'm big (Big Soulja)

[Verse 3: Lil Twist]
And now I'm big, I'm big
This Bentley start with a beep

This bitch didn't come with a key
Big Draco and Young Twist, new foreign on South Beach
But me in wife-beat would steal shit up my sleeve
She want a picture with me, I made his main bitch cheese
I'm in Balenciaga, he got forces with the crease
Get to stuntin' on this bitch, showin' her shit she never seen
Take her out to Tune house, he got Madonna across the street

This chopper gon' get an opp up out me
It's VVs in my teeth, nigga, while I'm talkin'
Don't make me shoot this 40

These rap niggas' life really boring
Up ten million just off of touring
Up twenty million off "Rick & Morty"
I'm thirty million my net worth
I shoot just like Pippen, Jordan
These rap niggas gettin' extorted
My garage is full of foreigns
Lamborghini auto, Grand Theft Auto, new Gelato
Bitches, they gon' follow, and you know they swallow
Ball hard 'til tomorrow, Louis V, no Aeropostale
Big Draco, I'm the author
Ball just like Vince Carter
Swim just like six-feet-deep water
Twenty-five bricks, that's a new quarter
Cook the dope up, the stove boiling
Lamborghini roadrunner
These cap-ass niggas don't know nothin'
I was trappin' Actavis, no Robitussin
Ice froze cold, no oven
Young niggas blowed for nothin'
Whip a bird

Call every plug in the world, I don't owe nothin'
Nigga, I don't want nothin' fronted
Sixteen with a whole M
Broke the rim, jumpin' out the gym, young nigga goin' in
Hit your homie up, you diss, nigga, we gon' spin again
Walk inside the mall, watch me ball, drop a light ten
The brick came lightskinned
Purple zaza pack look like Vikings
Rose golds pointer on my Rollie look like lightning
Man, my watches, they be beefin', they be lookin' like they fightin'
Nigga, we can hit like the Tennessee Titans
Niggas, they know—
Niggas, niggas, they know I might spin
Nigga, we blitzin' off the top, nigga, I'm goin' in
And every time I see an opp, I gotta get at him
First day out the LA County Jail, I was tryna hit at him

[Intro]
(You're so LayZ)
(Let's go, 8)

[Chorus]
Loud pack exotic, smokin' loud pack exotic
Loud pack exotic, smokin' zaza
Young niggas can't be tamed, they came out the jungle
Man, don't play them young niggas' aim, 'cause they can't wait to bust you

[Verse]
Seem like every other day, young nigga count a hundred K
Grippin' on my Draco, I'm grippin' on my baby K
Smoke up on my name inside the city, I had to get it straight
You can't cap on my name, 'cause everything I did came out from pain
My mama called me yesterday, bustdown everything
I think I'm gon' do all my shows on tour with a song, no private plane
I'm ridin' around with my strap, I hope them opps know, 'cause I'ma smoke his brain
I 'membеr when I got my chain, I bust that thing from Johnny Dang
I 'member I ran into T-Pain, hе had a stupid big-ass chain
I think it said "Big Ass Chain," I was like, "This shit insane"
Ain't nothin' that I do be plain, killers with me smoke your brain
Double-R that Cullinan, I like to swerve and turn in lanes
I like to hit the mall like I'm a regular
But if the opps run on me, I apply pressure, he on a stretcher, yeah, yeah
Et cetera, et cetera, got cash on my schedule
I find out these niggas scary, we gon' send them bullets like Hail Mary
I caught an opp, found out that he was faker than tooth fairy
I got my stick up on my hip, he needs some milk, dairy
I 'member when I caught a play for like three M's
I 'member I caught a play for like three M's on my Blackberry

[Chorus]
Loud pack exotic, smokin' loud pack exotic
Loud pack exotic, smokin' zaza
Young niggas can't be tamed, they came out the jungle
Man, don't play them young niggas' aim, 'cause they can't wait to bust you

[Verse 1]
Fill me up
So close I've got you face to face
Playing rough
Can't help it when you say my name

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin

[Chorus]
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight
You and I
Baby, we can set the world on fire
I, dawn is here, I'm coming 'round
I love the way you hold me down
Afterlight
Dirty dancing in the dark tonight

[Verse 2]
Silhouettes
And shadows moving in our bed
Take a guess
Tell me what you think happens next

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel you closer
I'm losing my composure
I'm drowning in a pool of adrenaline
I wanna feel your thunder
I'll let you take me under
Shakes and shivers riding up my skin

[Chorus]
The little things I like about you
How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When your feeling is a little strung out
Everything we talk about
Living in the city is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

[Verse 1]
Turn in your direction
Feeling like I need attention
I told you this once or twice
Won't you hear?
I see you in the yard drinking a beer
Leaving me undressed
Like some cheap classic movie
Maybe I'm a little obsessed
Maybe you do use me

[Refrain]
One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Kissing your mouth
You were inside of me
Kissing my mouth
Seeing out that needle eye
Seeing out that needle eye
Seeing out that needle eye

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
The little things I like about you
How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When your feeling is a little strung out
Everything we talk about
New York City is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

[Refrain]
One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Where are you now?
Where are you now? (Ah)

[Outro]
Ah, oh

Will you stay?
Will you feel?
You'll feel
Oh-oh, ooh

So satisfied I'm on my way

[Chorus: 2-D]
Jimmy, Jimmy
There's pressure on you
A life ain't feelin' how it used to
Jimmy, Jimmy
No need to be sad
When they play your song, we'll get along

[Verse 1: AJ Tracey & 2-D]
I been searchin', lookin' for a permanent reason
Out of sync with the seasons, not sure what I believe in
And a burden, why is bein' loved so appealin'?
Can't conform, I'm alone
We're all just lost without meanin' (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Just a boy from the West, I'm born and bred
We coulda been rich, was poor instead
My evenings are blue, all my mornings red
I had to make scores from gents (Jimmy, Jimmy)
I salute all my local fiends
They're smilin', locked in a smoker's dream
Kept an ace like a poker team (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Just a teen sellin' coke to fiends (Jimmy, Jimmy)
I took remedy, young ones I love
Got the money, I got stuck inside of my mind
Quick solutions was all I could find
I was earnin', but losin' my time (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Portobello, I'm sippin' on wine
With a beautiful Notting Hill mother of five
Mental muscle, the strong will survive
That's why I drink white rum on the Manchester Drive

[Chorus: 2-D]
Jimmy, Jimmy
Now you're out of control
And the life you're livin' is a dead-end road
Jimmy, Jimmy
No need to be sad
When they play your song, we'll get along
Jimmy, Jimmy

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey & 2-D]
Left Electric and headed to SoHo, now I'm in the box, I had way too much yak (Woo)
Hate the front so I sat in the back with a girl from Iran and the peachiest back (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Love me a spliff, but I gotta keep it a stack, the females around me are crack
Got me wired, I ain't comin' back to reality, I bleed it out in the track (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Did some things that I swear I won't tell
Like, who do I call? Got redemption from Hell
Love and hate are like Kenan and Kel
I broke up my kis, now my friends in the cell (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Life is for livin', I love me some shillings
But God willin', people love me for my skillin'
Went from sittin' in gold with them billions
To billboards on winning, thank God, now I'm chillin'

[Break: 2-D]
Jimmy, Jimmy
This pressure
Jimmy, Jimmy

[Chorus: 2-D]
Jimmy, Jimmy
This pressure on you
A life ain't feelin' how it used to
Jimmy, Jimmy
No need to be sad
When they play your song, we'll get along
Jimmy, Jimmy

[Outro: 2-D]
Woo
Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy

[Verse 1: 2-D,  Ensemble & Alicaì Harley]
I like the future (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
But it's really hard to get there (Protect your head or you'll end up dead)
I think I'll wear a space suit  (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
And don't forget your seatbelt (Protect your head or you'll end up dead)
Life is meant for living, if I do it again I'll do it with you
Sometimes it feels like I ain't met you, it feels like it's déjà vu (Déjà vu)
Like we wеre made for each othеr, I don't mind my love in two
Baby we are perfectly imperfect, but that's what makes you you (I like)

[Chorus: Alicaì Harley,  Ensemble &  2-D]
Oh, nah nah nah, oh nah nah nah nah (Déjà vu) (I like, oh oh oh)

Oh, nah nah nah, oh nah nah nah nah  (Déjà vu) (I like)
Oh, nah nah nah nah  (Déjà vu)

[Verse 2: 2-D, Ensemble & Alicaì Harley]
My brain's creserted (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
That means I'm lost in the desert (Protect your head or you'll end up dead)
Some say I'm a martian (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
I always wear a seatbelt (Protect your head or you'll end up dead)
Life is meant for living, if I do it again I'll do it with you

[Bridge: Alicaì Harley, Ensemble, & Both]
Yuh, you badda' than a pack of cigarette now

('Cause I don't know what they are)
Get me up on the groove, yeah, in 1974
And we can dance all night at the club and I'll, and I'll take you home
I am a time traveller from your distant past, but I've always been with you
I am a time traveller from your distant past, but I was always lovin' you

[Chorus: Alicaì Harley, Ensemble, 2-D, & All Together]

[Verse 1: Jelani Blackman]
Hey, I don't mind change
I don't like hate (Nah)
See when the sound system break
We make the system shake (Bullet)
When a girl wanna swing my way
Play street with the street that I played
But I'm on a street over here, all saints
Imagine no saints when you wake, aye
That's a good taste, hmm, that's a good space
Hey, this ain't my place
Like that's a real wave (Hmm)
I miss it so deeply
Well, put that shit on my grave
I buck and sway (And sway)
Ten toes for the rave in the ring, aye (Let's)

[Chorus: Jelani Blackman]
I love carnival bass (Go)
Ya don't feel the samе? (Let's)
That's cool, don't get in my way (Go)
In fact, don't migrate
(Lеt's) Yeah, and we like champagne
But we like Red Stripe and we like Wray (Go)
Ya don't feel the same?
That's cool, don't get in my way (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Jelani Blackman]
Oh, back in day
Notting Hill weren't no film
Teddy boys on my granddad outside, buy it back
Take 'cause his bones lie still (Hmm)
Salon in Ireland, they were really out there in the field
When the vibe was real, that's why I get in my feels (Let's go)
And I know that I can't fucking live here still (Go)

[Chorus: Jelani Blackman]
Ya don't feel the same? (Let's)
That's cool, don't get in my way (Go)
In fact, don't migrate
(Let's) Yeah, we like champagne
But we like Red Stripe and we like Wray (Go)
Ya don't feel the same?
That's cool, don't get in my way (Let's go)

[Bridge: 2-D & Barrington Levy]
Yeah, it's just the same as I thought it would be
When I was in carnival
I followed your principle
Do you really think I'd leave you?
Meanwhile

[Chorus: Jelani Blackman]
(Let's)
Uh, I love carnival bass (Go)
Ya don't feel the same? (Let's)

Yeah, we like champagne
But we like Red Stripe and we like Wray (Go)
Ya don't feel the same?
That's cool, don't get in my way (Let's go)

[Bridge: 2-D & Barrington Levy]
Yeah, it's just the same as I thought it would be
When I was in carnival
Dancing on protocol
Do you really think I'd forget you?
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
Meanwhile
Meanwhile

[Chorus: Jelani Blackman]
Said I love carnival bass
Ya don't feel the same?
That's cool, don't get in my way
In fact, don't migrate
Mmm, we like champagne
But we like Red Stripe and we like Wray
Ya don't feel the same?
That's cool, don't get in my way

- So what do you think of your food?

- Much better! Merci beaucoup!

- Gesundheit!

- He said its all good!

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open, open, open

[Interlude]
Open, open, open
Open, open, open

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen when your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm, you're frozen when your heart's not open, open, open
When your heart's not open, open, open

[Bridge]
Open your heart
It's not that hard
Open your heart
It's not that hard
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard

[Chorus]
When your heart's not open, open, open
When your heart's not open, open, open
When your heart's not open, open, open
When your heart's not open, open
You're frozen when your heart's not open, open, open

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
All my people out the trenches
Lift us up, make us alright
The devil can't stand your presence
Stand with God and I got leverage
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes Lord, we wave 'em high

[Verse 1: KayCyy]
Exhausted, it’s never the right time to go
I had to think twice before I moved
Standing my ground won’t break my mood
Choose puddles, be careful when you choose your steps
Gotta make it right before your left
Gotta make it right before your left
Exhausted, it’s never the right time go
I had to think twice before I moved
Standing my ground won’t break my mood
Choose puddles, be careful when you choose your steps
Gotta make a right before your left
Gotta make a right before your left

[Bridge: KayCyy with Sunday Service Choir]
Everybody wanna feel like
Everything gon' be right
New me over the old me
Let it out, let it all out
I can't help not feeling alright
Lord please make it alright
Forgive us all make it alright
Surround us all make it alright

[Verse 2: KayCyy & Sunday Service Choir]
Dear God, make it alright
Only You can make it alright
Dear Lord, make it alright
Nothing else ever feels right
Dear God, make it alright
Nothing else ever feels right
Na-na-na, nothing else ever feels right
Save me yeah, make it alright
Bow our heads because it's alright
Alright, mmm, mmm, mmm
24 hours, 24 candles, 24 hours

[Interlude: KayCyy with Sunday Service Choir]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes Lord, we put ‘em high, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
My God, Jehovah Jireh, my provider
People listen, what a vision
Wonderful vision, what a vision
Pray we listen, pray we listen
Washed us in blood, pessimism
He died for them, but he risen
Behold the land, we are in denial
Then I took the test, but I jumped the trial
This is the jam, like Jackie Chan
In my mommy's land, George Michael's sayin'
"Lend me your ear", like she Van Gogh
She like the old gang, like Faneto
Washed us in blood, pessimism
He died for them, but he risen
Wonderful vision, what a vision
Pray we listen, pray we listen

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
All my people out the trenches
Lift us up, make us alright
The devil can't stand your presence
Stand with God and I got leverage
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes Lord, we wave 'em high

[Outro: Sunday Service Choir]

Everything we did for the crib did here
Flexing with the business trip
Go off grid, take some G6
Lit, lit, '76
He spit this, then ask for change, tsk-tsk-tsk
Take this trip, trip, rip this, this

(Intro)

Yeah, yeah, ok, ok…
You want raps?
Alright, look…
Yeah

(Verse 1)
Ok, back when I didn’t have the clout
And a little hard liquor had me passing out
I was acting out, blunts that we passed around
I used to short a motherfucker on a half an ounce uh
I was trying’ to take the faster route
Cashin’ out to get up out of my daddy’s house
But ask around, every time I’m back in town
My city hold me down like the motherfucking Mayor, uh
Oh yeah, that’s the bounce, the class is out
So now it’s time to trash the house
They, on my trail like a basset hound
Let's play a little game of cat and mouse, track them down
Who’s the class clown? Who’s laughing now?
I’m getting high trying to catch a cloud
Better not get involved, killing y’all raps is foul
You might as well pick the casket out, dead motherfucker!
I don’t see y’all, wouldn’t want to be y’all
Recall, they some Majors feeling like tee ball
A bunch of new motherfuckers and they got it
But got it just won’t get it if it’s just nothing at all
I’m a full-year veteran, better than I’ve ever been
You think you’re sick? I got the god-damn medicine
Lil’ homies say my name, everybody know I changed the game
(Chorus)
God, God, God Damn, (God Damn)
God Damn (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn (God Damn)
God, God, God Damn, (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn! (God Damn!)



(Verse 2)
Um...
Said
Why are you acting like a straight up bitch?
Come to Pittsburgh homie, we don’t play that shit
Real motherfuckers over there, young polar bear
Colder than a frozen air, snowing at the local fair
Bitch I’m a motherfucking monster, all I know is conquer
Do you like Dahmer? oper-ate, I’m a doctor
Phantom of the Opera, run your whole squad up
Bang!
Came back just to claim my spot
You motherfuckers at the top really ain’t that hot
Go ahead homie, take your shot, uh, you only get one shot!
I bought a crib that I can’t afford
Have a butt-naked bitch come and stay at my floor
Go hard until I can’t no more
All of y’all better plan for war
Yeah, the flow water, washing out your whole roster
Trying to take what’s mine just don’t bother
I’ve built that, five hundred down, get a mil back
Real rap, everything I do know I kill that
I do this, it ain’t no joke, inhale got to taste that smoke
You on Top because you ain’t that dope
Kill yourself come and take this rope
(Chorus)
God, God, God Damn, (God Damn)
God Damn (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn (God Damn)
God, God, God Damn, (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn (God Damn)
Uh, God Damn! (God Damn!)

*instrumental*

[Verse 1]
Smile that shines like stars at night
Cold and bright the dying light
Tears they fall like rain in storm
You echo through my brain like once before

[Chorus]
I just wanna share the world with you
Show you all the things that I could do

[Verse 2]
Wide awake alone at night
Remember how we laid in my bed that time
Heart stopped beating as galaxies collide
Earth stood still as our breath combined

[Chorus]
I just wanna share the world with you
Show you all the things that I could do
I just wanna share the world with you
Show you all the things that I could do
It's easy to get frustrated
When you got no answers
It's easy to get overwhelmed
Make you want to put the blame on somebody else

I can sympathize with ya
Yeah, I will always ride with ya
I'll be the one cry with you
You can lay it on me
I won't leave you lonely
No

You can lay it on me
I won't leave you lonely

Lonely
I won't, I won't
You can lay it on me
I won't leave you lonely

I can see you in your head again
No, I can't stand to see you when you're struggling
You need a little motivation
Remember lifе is a celebration
Got thoughts that costs for new pеrspective
And lord knows I need some good direction
May this time is of the essence
You can lay it on me
I won't leave you lonely
No

You can lay it on me
I won't leave you lonely

Lonely
I won't, I won't
You can lay it on me
I won't leave you lonely
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you

And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?

And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry

And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my bеst
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelеntlessly upset

They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

Yeah

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset

They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
Yeah

Got a broken ego, broken heart
And God, I don't even know where to start

[Intro: J.R. Rotem]
J.R., Sean Kingston

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
See, it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love last forever (Last forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
Wе made it very clear
And thеy also said
That we couldn't last together (Last together)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down south
Oh I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (Make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh, I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal

[Intro: J.R. Rotem]
J.R., Sean Kingston

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
See, it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love last forever (Last forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
Wе made it very clear
And thеy also said
That we couldn't last together (Last together)

[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal
Brown guilty eyes and little white lie
Yeah, I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid

Ain't it funny
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still
You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there crying, wondering what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And maybe I'm just not as interesting as the girls you had before
But god, you couldn't have cared less about someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart, but you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy, I just want myself back

Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there crying, wondering what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

And don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy, feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else

And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied, but that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you
Enough for you
No, nothing's enough for you

[Verse 1]
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know wе weren't perfеct
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Outro]
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent thе night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffectеd, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies, wish I didn't care
I know their beauty's not my lack, but it feels like that
Weight is on my back, and I can't let it go

Co-comparison is killing me slowly
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else, my jealousy, jealousy started following me
Started following me

And I see everyone getting all the things I want
And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it, oh God, I sound crazy
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but I can't help getting caught up in it all

Co-comparison is killing me slowly
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself, rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else, but jealousy, jealousy
Yeah, all your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're living the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losing it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

Co-comparison is killing me slowly
I think I think too much 'bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself, rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else), jealousy, jealousy
I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else, jealousy, jealousy started following me

[Verse 1]
I, I may be weary
Women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
But to one who's weary
Try a little tenderness

[Verse 2]
And I may be waiting
Just anticipating
All the things that I may never, ever
Ever, ever possess
But while I'm waiting
Try just a little tenderness

[Verse 3]
I may be, I may be sentimental
I've had my grief
And I've had my care, yes
And just a good word, soft and gentle
I say that that one word can make it so much easier to bear
Yes, it can
And I might forget it
But don't let me, don't let me forget
Because love is all of my happiness
When you try just a
A little tender, tender, ooh
Try just a little tenderness

[Intro: Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls]
I'm gonna call on one of my brothers to the stage at this time
And ask him to join me, if he will
(Yes) Mr Lou Rawls

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls]
At, at, at, at last, at last
My, my love has come along, yeah
My lonely days are over (Well)
Don't you know it?
And life is like, like a song, oh
Oh-ooh-ooh
Oh, at last, at last, mmm
The skies above, the skies above are blue (Yes, they)
Yes, they are (Oh, yeah)
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night, the night that I looked at you, yeah
(Well) You know what I mean (Yes, ma'am)

[Verse: Lou Rawls, Aretha Franklin]
Yeah, I found a dream (A dream)
That I could speak to (Oh, baby)
That I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own (Oh, yes, you did, yeah)
I found a thrill (I found a thrill)
I would love to press my cheek to (I would press my cheek)
A thrill that I, I have never known, you, you
You, you, you (You, you, you) smiled
You, you smiled, baby
And then the spell (Ooh-ooh), it was cast
And then the spell was cast, and that's all
Now here we are (Here we are)
We are in Heaven, oh, baby
And we're here in good old Pittsburgh (Yes, we are), yes we are
I'm so glad you're mine at last (At last)
Well, well, well
Yeah, play the horn

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse: Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls]
I found a dream I could speak to (Well)

Yes, indeed (You really, really)
A dream that I (A dream that I), I know
Don't you know, don't you know you smiled (You smiled)
To me, baby
And then, then the spell, it was cast, cast (Was it really cast?)
Yes, it was, baby
Do you believe it was cast? Mm
Now here we are (Here we are), we are in Heaven (Heaven)
And I'm so glad, I'm so glad (Are you really glad?)
I'm so glad about (Ooh, are you really glad?)
I'm gonna run and tell the world about it (Would you tip and tell a few people?)
Yes, indeed, baby
I'm so glad you're mine (Oh-oh-oh), mine
So glad you're mine, you're mine (Sounds like the hill for travellers to me)
Mine, mine (You're so), mine, mine, mine, mine (Mine)
Mine (Ooh-ooh)
I'm so glad you're mine, yeah

[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
May I say that it is a pleasure
And, indeed, an honor to perform for you this evening
I've chosen for my second selection
A song that I feel is universal in the world
It is understood on any continent, in any language
And is as relevant today as it was the day it was written by John Newton

[Verse 1]
Ah, ah-ah
Amazing grace
How, how sweet
The, the sound
That, that saved
A, a wretch like, like me
I, oh, I once
Was, I was lost
Ooh-ooh-ooh, but now
I, I'm found
Was, was blind
But, but now I, I see

[Verse 2]
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me, oh, Lord
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
(I'm gonna ask thе ladies to join in)
(Will you join in?)
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That savеd a wretch like me (Oh, Lord)
I once was lost (I was lost), but now I'm found
Was blind, but now

[Outro]
He's amazing, He's amazing
He's amazing, oh, yeah
He's amazing (He's amazing)
Oh-oh, yes, He is
He's amazing (Oh, yeah)

Ooh, I see
I see (See), oh yeah

[Intro]
This is for ladies
Ladies only
This is your moment
It's your time
This is for ladies
For the girls only
This is your moment
To shine
Let the fellas take a look
Take a look, take a look
Ooh, at what they're missin'
And if anything beats a boy
It's some good, old-fashioned huggin'
(Ooh, get it, baby!)
And kissin'

[Verse 1]
Ladies only
You got the spotlight, let your hair on down
Ladies only
Let your partner spin you 'round and 'round

Sparkle all in your hair
Dance, lady, lady there

[Verse 2]
Ladies only
The night is young; the party's just begun

And there goes my hat into the ring
Mesdames seulement 

[?]

[Intro]
I think that's what sets it up
One, two, three
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Though you don't call me anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
On your window pane
I wanna tell you, baby
Changes I've been going through
Missing you, listen, you

[Chorus]
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to decide you had to set me free?
I'm gonna swallow my pride
I'm gonna beg you to please, baby, please see me
Gonna walk by myself to prove that my love is true
All for you

[Chorus]
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do

[Bridge]
Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of fear
Hear my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying

[Verse 3]
Although your phone, you ignore
Somehow I must, somеhow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
Gonna camp by your steps 'til I gеt through to you
I've got to change your view

[Chorus]
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me, that's what I'm gonna do

[Outro]
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane, open up, baby
Window pane, open up, baby
Tap on your door, tap on your window pane
Window pane
Let's make a track now

[Verse 1]
Just thought of a tune called "The Boy From Bombay"
I ain't got no idea what I am gon' say
A melody of something that I feel
And wondering if this tune is really real
Feel it, just sing to yourself about the boy from Bombay
Feels kinda close, but it's actually far away
It's all a kind of magic mystery
Just as much to you as it is to me

[Chorus]
But I know the boy from Bombay
She loved the boy from Bombay
She loved him with all of her heart
With all of her heart, with all of her heart
With all of her heart, with all of her heart, with her

[Verse 2]
Feels like some love riding on a wind of spring
And love in all forms is a beautiful, beautiful thing
If you find yourself trying to hum
Remember where the melody came from
It's the song or the tune or the boy from Bombay
Feels kinda close, but it's actually far away
Especially for you if you're kind of blue
I feel good about it, and I hope you do, too, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
The boy from Bombay
I'll give that one to the DJ

[Intro]

Said I won't (Leave it alone)
(Why don't you, why don't you let it be?) Mm-mm-mm
(Still water run deep) Yes, it do (Yes, it do)
(Oh yeah) If you only believe

[Verse 1]
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all, is all around

[Chorus]
Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
(Like a bridge) Just like a bridge
(Over troubled) Over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 2]
Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way
(See how they shine?) See how they shine?
Oh, and if you ever need a friend (Need a friend)
Look around, I'm sailing right behind (Ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
Just like a bridge over troubled water (Like a bridge over troubled water)
I'll be there to lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water (Like a bridge over troubled water)
I will lay me down
(Oh, I'll be your bridge, yes, I will)

[Bridge]
(Don't trouble the water)
Said I wouldn't (Leave it alone)
Well (Why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
Uh-huh (Still water run deep)
I know that (Yes, it do), yeah (Oh yeah)

[Intro]
To be young
Gifted and Black
Oh, what a lovely, precious thing
Oh, when you're
Yes, yes, when you're
When you're young
Yeah, thank you, Jesus
Gifted and Black
Open your heart, it's all I need

[Verse]
In this whole world, you know
There are millions of boys and girls
Who are young, gifted, and Black
With their souls intact, and that's a fact
"You are young, gifted, and you're Black"
We must begin to tell our young
"There's a world waiting for you, you
Yours is the quest that's just begun"
When you're feeling real low
Here's a great truth you should remеmber and know
That you're young, gifted, and Black
You got your soul intact, oh, and that's a fact

[Outro]
You'rе young, gifted, and Black
Young, gifted, and Black
Young, gifted, and Black
Young, gifted, and Black
Young, gifted, and Black
Young, gifted, and Black

[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be (Words of wisdom)

[Verse 2]
And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may bе parted
There is still a chancе that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be (There will be an answer)
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be (Words of wisdom, let it be)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be (Whisper words of wisdom)

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be (There will be an answer)
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, leave it alone, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be (Let it be)

You told me
That you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone and hours seem like years
So, darling, I sing my song

[Verse]
Your leaving
Makes my heart beat slow and slow
Now I'm wondering, where did you go?
Please tell me, tell me what is wrong
I still love you
Won't you please come back to me?
Come back where, where you ought to be
Don't stay away from me
'Cause you'll always be my own
We'll be together for eternity

[Chorus]
You told me
That you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone and hours seem like years
And you left me singing a song
I'm just singing a song
You left me singing a song

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try (Try), and I try (Try)
Said, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried, tried, tried
I can't get no, I can't get no, no, oh

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car
And a man comes on the radio
Telling me more and more
About some useless information
That's supposed to power my imagination
I can't get no
Oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey
Oh, baby, that's what I say
Yes, it is
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, baby, baby, that's what I say
Yes, it is, oh-oh

Well, I've done all I can do

Each thing new and different I try (Try)
Seems to turn out to be one big bore

[Outro]
I can't get no
Oh, no, no, no

Hey, yeah (When you're done)
Try to, try to, try to get some type of
Satisfaction, baby

[Intro]
(Banks made this)

[Verse 1]
It's the return
Ain’t nobody messin' with a brother named Luda', no matter how hard you try
Top 5 dead or alive, look in my eyes, realize I ain’t tellin' no lies, I
Came in the game with a chip on my shoulder, had to brush it off
A couple million dollars worth of drip, but I'm cut from a different cloth
Tell my competition lay low
I'm in the booth and over my head, you can see a halo
Why am I the best? 'Cause I say so
And every record, every plaque, every win 'cause this my every day flow
Put a crown on the man with the mic in his hand from Atlanta because there'll never be another
Ludacris spreadin' my gift like Jif
And I’m stuck in your grill like peanut butter, I’m on

[Chorus]
Ice givin' me the chills
The drank, I never let it spill
Mouth wide, how It feel?
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Hit the block, new whip
Let me see you show your grill
Ice givin’ me the chills
The drank, I never let it spill
Mouth wide, how It feel?
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Hit the block, new whip
Let me see you show your grill

[Verse 2]
Luda's already/R-rated, reincarnated, back with the crew, and we all faded
Sippin' somethin' while we money chasin’, medicatin', celebratin' 'cause we all we made it
Out the hood,  leatherwood, ridin' in somethin' foreign, lift the door and then pop the hood
Speakers bumpin', watch me pop the trunk
Life is short, a hustler gotta stunt, life is short, a hustler got a ball
If it ain't about money, don't take the call
But I'll walk in a store, put a bag on the floor and tell the manager that I want it all
Snatch everything that I came for
Cold water dumped on my neck
Now I'm frozen down to my ankles, and I'm on

[Chorus]
Ice givin' me the chills
The drank, I never let it spill
Mouth wide, how It feel?
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Hit the block, new whip
Let me see you show your grill
Ice givin' me the chills
The drank, I never let it spill
Mouth wide, how It feel?
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Let me see you show your grill
Hit the block, new whip
Let me see you show your grill

[Intro]
He got an opportunity to legitimize his hustle now
You know what I mean? He come from the street
I mean, so he gotta make wise decisions, know what I mean?
He ain't "Meek Mill, the street nigga" no more (Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap)
Know what I mean? He done legitimized his hustle
So those decisions that he make in the day time, they gotta be wise decisions, know what I mean?
Can't allow this motion to kick things back
I mean, or he gon' crash

[Verse]
It been eleven years, I held it in and I ain't shеd a tear
I had a story I ain't never sharе
Thought it was normal 'cause they left us here
This for the voices they will never hear
Walkin' out the courtroom, cameras everywhere, yeah
And they say, "Better join 'em, you can't beat 'em"
Don't believe 'em 'cause I went against the odds to make it even
It's deceivin', they say, "You gettin' probation, you think you leavin'?"
But they get technical, they give you violations, for even breathin'
Niggas pleadin', they got no money for lawyers, to even feed 'em
Nobody left to raise our sons and our daughters, so they repeat us
Reapin', innocent for twenty-eight years, 'cause mamas' grievin'
Only goals' to make it back home while she's still breathin'
Can you believe it, in the land of the free I'm fightin' for freedom?
They ain't even have no evidence on 'em, they tryna keep 'em
Black babies' still caught in the system, they try and Meek 'em
My new condo overlook Central Park and it's still reekin'
Said we guilty 'til we innocent ('Til we innocent)
And they gon' try and kill us with these sentences (Sentences)
It wasn't for the fame, they wouldn't mention it (They wouldn't mention it)
That's why I take my platform and distribute it for the ones that gotta live in it, it get interestin' (Get interestin')
When all the cops ain't got no discipline, we live in it (We live in it)
The ones 

[?] 'cause there be times the judge ain't listenin' (Ain't listenin')
And you can't label me a rapper 'cause I'm different, kid
And the only difference is, I'm really makin' differences (Differences)
I done took my pen and pad and made some businesses
This ain't no cap, I used to trap and now my business lit
Now I can't tell you, "Mind yo' business" 'cause my business is
Really on yo' mind, right where your fitted is, I'm fit for this
I gotta inspire them
Motivate the people where I come from, my requirement
Say it loud, "I won't be a product of my environment"
Say it again, "I won't be a product of my environment", we playin' to win (Playin' to win)
Took them bars they locked me in and made it a rap
I took them cells that they gave us and I made it a plaque
Before the sales on my album, I was scrapin' a wack
I turned them jails into mansions with a lake in the back
Now, there ain't no takin' me back, I just left in a chopper
And brought some billionaires together so they never could stop us
Had a dream, they say I'm king like Martin Luther, the doctor
We freein' niggas, it's like two for a dollar
A hundred-million on reform, nigga (Reform, nigga)
They never seen it, what you doin', nigga? (What you doin', nigga?)
Puttin' work and puttin' on, nigga (Puttin' on, nigga)
You know whoever doubt on 

[?], nigga (

[?], nigga)
I knew I was the one, the first, yeah, I was born, nigga, hangin' out the door, nigga
Rolls Royce drop-top, every time the cops stop
My career was at a lost stop, but I will not stop
The system broken, we can fix it, take it to the chop shop
Pick it apart and build it back, make it equal for the Browns and Blacks
Word up (Word up)

[Outro]

So today, today we honor Robert "Meek Mill" Williams

[Verse 1]
You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you
We do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine so

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

[Verse 2]
Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
And it's fire, you're like this Bourbon, hundred proof
Yeah, they don't burn the way you do
Yeah, we're better in the dark so

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

[Guitar Solo / Instrumental Break]
Hey

[Bridge]
Kinda like that Georgia wind
We'll be gone and back again
But always wind up right back where we are
Playin' roulette with our hearts
And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

[Outro]
Every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
You wanna talk to me
You got many things to say
You want the spirit to be speaking through
But your lust for comfort get in the way
I can read it in your eyes, oh
What your heart will not reveal
And that old evil burden has been draggin' you down
Bound to grind you 'neath the wheel

Yonder comes sin
(Walkin' like a man, talkin' like an angel)
Yonder comes sin
(Proud like a peacock, swift like an eagle)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to
Look at your hands, see what they been into
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin

You see this woman standin' next to me
She's foreign to your sight
Well, hеr eyes may be a diffеrent colour than mine
But her blood is red and her bones are white
You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things
But your fifty-dollar smile confirms
You're still tryin' to buy your way into the dreams of them
Whose bodies will be food for worms
Yonder comes sin
(Ready and steady, willing and able)
Yonder comes sin
(Standin' on the chair, standin' on the table)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to
Look at your hands, see what they've been into
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin

I say "See them six wild horses, honey
You say "I don't even see one"
You say "Point them out to me, love"
I say "Honey I got to run"
My brother's blood is crying from the grave
But you can't hear the voice
I stand in jeopardy every hour
Wonderin' what reason you have to rejoice

Yonder comes sin
(Down on your knees, down into the ditches)
Yonder comes sin
(Vomiting up jewels, vomiting up riches)
Look at your feet see where they've been to
Look at your hands, see what they've been into
Enough to put you to tail-spin
Yonder comes sin
Jeremiah preached repentance
To those that would turn from hell
But the critics all gave him such bad reviews
Put him down at the bottom of a well
Kept on talking anyway
As the people were put into chains
Wasn't nobody there to say "Bon voyage"
Or shatter any bottles of champagne

Yonder comes sin
(Cracking that whip, just like a feather)
Yonder comes sin
(Put a knife in your back while talking about the weather)
Look at your feet see where they've been to
Look at your hands, see what they've been into
Can you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin
(Thief on the cross
Chances are slim)

There's a thief on the cross
His chances are slim
There's thief on the cross
I want to talk to him

Well everybody's been diverted
Everybody lookin' the other way
Everybody's attention is divided
Well they may not afford to wait, well

There's a thief on the cross
His chances are slim
There's thief on the cross
I want to talk to him

Wanna ask him 'bout his mother
Wanna ask him 'bout his world
Wanna ask him 'bout to talk to himself
If this time it didn't roll too well, wеll
There's a thief on thе cross
His chances are slim
There's thief on the cross
I want to talk to him

Well, everybody know too excited
Don't be too surprised
Head for the dawn and you can see it well
And it's rising in his eyes, well

There's a thief on the cross
His chances are slim
There's thief on the cross
I want to talk to him

There's a thief on the cross
There's a thief on the cross

Now there's winning, ruling and readin'
Everybody goes (?)
Every scene be too excited
Whether Iran or Mexico, well

There's a thief on the cross
His chances are slim
There's thief on the cross
I want to talk to him
There's a thief on the cross
Thief on the cross
There's a thief on the cross
There's a thief on the cross
There's a thief on the cross
There is a city of gold
Far from this rat-race, eats at your soul
Far from the confusion and the bars that hold
There is a city of gold

There is a country of light
Raised up in glory, angels wear white
Never know darkness, never know night
There is a country of light

There is a city of love
Far from this world, stuff dreams are made of
Fear of no darkness, beyond the stars above
There is a city of love

There is a city of hope
Don't need no doctor, don't need no dope
I'm ready and willing, throw down a rope
There is a city of hope

There is a city of gold
Far from this rat race that tears at your soul
Far from the confusion and the bars that hold
There is a city of gold
There is a city of gold
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand

Friends, I'd like to tell a story of a family I once knew
We'll call them William and Mary and their little daughter Sue
Now Mary was just the average housewife
And Bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family arguments
But neither onе ever got mad
Then onе day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word lead to another
And the last word lead to divorce
Now here's two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthen their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense
You know she didn't ask to be brought to this world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones that its hurting the most
There'd be a lot more honest lovin'
In this cruel world today
If just a few hundred parents
Could hear little Sue say
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand
Well you heard about Pharaoh's army
Tramplin' through the mud
You heard about the Hebrew children
Redeemed by blood
Same spirit dwellin' in you
That raised Christ from the dead
If you're quick in your mortal body
Then let it run to your head

And cover down, cover down, pray through
Cover down, cover down, pray through

Got to have protection
By the full armour of the Lord
Well, the word of God is sharper
Than any double sided sword
He's the hammer of salvation
The breastplate of righteousness
Genesis to revelation
Repent and confess
Cover down, cover down, pray through
Cover down, cover down, pray through

Well, you wake up early in the morning
Turning from side to side
Something giving you a warning
You can't run and you can't hide
Demands are laid upon you
And burdens you can't bear
Sins you can't even remember
Are always waiting to say hello to you there

Cover down, cover down, pray through
Cover down, cover down, pray through

You got an image of yourself, I know
But you've built it alone
But it will come a-tumbling, a-tumbling down
Just like walls made of stone
You will be separated
From everything you seem to be
You think you'll be liberated
But the grave won't set you free

You got to cover down, cover down, pray through
Cover down, cover down, pray through
Cover down, cover down, pray through
Cover down, cover down, pray through
I will love him
I will serve him
I will glorify his name

He came on East out of Galilee
And disappeared like when he taught
He came down onto his own
His own knew him not
But as for me

I will love him
I will serve him
I will glorify his name

He said when the fig tree was blooming
He would be at the gate
He was talking 'bout the state of Israel
From nineteen forty-eight
And the time is near, and

I will love him
I will serve him
I will glorify His name
When He was down conceivеd here
His mother didn’t know what shе carried
Took an angel of the lord
To tell her what she done carry
Carry for all mankind, that

I will love him
I will serve him
I will glorify His name

Did anybody say it was gonna be easy?
Nobody said that you couldn't complain
The God of the world tried to drive me crazy
Even Peter denied him
Standin' right beside him
They took him out and falsely tried him
Eventually crucified him
Who am I to say I wouldn't do the same?

When he who repaired the roof
Tried to tilt against the grain
When Herod found out that he was born
He had every boy child slain
(?)

I will love him
I will serve him
I will glorify His name
Ooh
Hey you, I've given up that action
I've got something that I want to ask you, ask you
Ask you, ask you
Ask you, ask you
Do you believe in the hereafter?
Well, if you do girl then you know what are you after
I've got something I wanna say
Oh, let me tell ya (mm, mm, mm)
I've been in many places
Seen many faces (mm, mm, ooh)
But I met this young lady
She makes the hair on the nape of my neck stand up
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Some kind of way, you know?
I've got to tell her
In a very special way
That she brings joy to my life
To a world that was cold and forbidden
Now there's a new day
I can't let her get away
Somehow I know that
I've got to tell her that she's special
And how much I really, really, really love her
This is my promise
To you, darling
(Intro - Otis Williams)

Everybody needs one

I got a call just the other day
From a friend I used to have
She was reaching out to touch somebody
Lord knows she sure could use a friend
(Life had been kind of rough)
Oh, yeah
She had been dissed by a man
(I said: "Take me by the hand")
And I'll stand right by your, girl

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, yeah, hey
Oh no
Na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Just to feel your body
Your sensual desire
You know my heart goes crazy
When your tender lips touch mine
Let's explore our love
And the candlelight and wine
We'll leave the world behind, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, do you believe
In the miracle of love?
Would you try and see?
I'm the one you're dreamin' of
Baby, close your eyes
Let the fantasy becomе real life
Oh, yeah
Rеal life

[Chorus]
Stay 'til the mornin', baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
Like I wanna rock you
(Please)
(Stay with me, baby)
Stay 'til the mornin', baby, let me know
That you want me too
I wanna rock you, baby (I wanna rock you, baby)

[Verse 2]
Can you feel me, baby
'Cause I'm comin' from the heart
You're such a sexy lady, ooh
Just tell me where to start
I'll make sweet, sweet love
Like you never felt before
And give you so much more, hey, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
(When you need a friend)

(In the mornin', in the evenin', and all night long)
Stay 'til the mornin', baby, let me know (Oh)
That you want me too (I want you)
I wanna rock you, baby (Don't you?)

[Verse 3]
When you move, love, swift, it's like the words from the God, justice
You can't civilize the Earth
'til you know the surface
And you don't realize your worth
Until you are worthless
You don't appreciate the Earth
Until you are earthless
I had a vision paining about her and what became it?
Takin' the best part until birth, the quest to name it
Remember when the first time
We both came acquainted
Conversin' all about life and everything pertainin'?
Conversation so deep
The clouds started rainin'
Meditate your whole weeks about your name changin'
I opened up the door, and when I showed you the way in
Now that you inside, you should consider stayin' (I wanna know)

[Chorus]
Stay 'til the mornin', baby, rock me, girl (baby)
Like I wanna rock you
(I, I wanna rock you, baby, I wanna know)

Stay 'til the mornin', baby, let me know (I wanna know if you wanna stay with me tonight)
That you want me too (girl, rock me, rock me, rock me, and rock me)
You better rock me, baby (all night long)

Stay 'til the mornin', baby, rock me, girl (I'd rather, I'd rather, rather make sweet love to you)
Like I wanna rock you (I'm beggin' you, baby)
(Help me, y'all)
Stay 'til the mornin', baby, let me know (oh, ooh)
That you want me too (that you want it too, Temptations sing)

(Stay)
I want you to stay

[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… еnd me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What arе you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Chorus]
Your love is so remarkable, incredible, unforgettable
Girl you know you're so lovable, adorable, sensual
Your love is so remarkable, incredible, unforgettable
Girl you know you're so lovable, adorable, sensual

[Verse 1]
Girl you know you're constantly on my mind
You know I think about you baby all the time
I'll give you the world
If I could only make you mine
So come here girl
Let's not waste no time

Repeat 1

[Verse 2]
Girl you know you're all I ever think about
Tell the other fellas to forget about
You bring out the freak in me and that's no doubt
Girl you know I really wanna turn you out
Repeat 1

[Spoken - Otis Williams]
I just wanna take this time
To let you know how I really feel about you darlin'
You're such a rare, rare find
You're like a Picasso that's priceless
You're like the fresh spring rain that purifies the lay of the land
And I'd put you on a pedestal so high that if you should ever fall off
I'd be there to catch you with open arms
Cuz I love you girl, I love you

2 - So let's get sensual
Let's get sensual
Let's get sensual

Baby let's get sensual
Let's get sensual
So let's get sensual
Let's get sensual

Repeat above until fade

[Verse 1 - Terry Weeks]
Listen girl
From the moment I saw you
My hair stood on end
Who's that lady so lovely
Like poetry in motion
I play by the rules
I mean no disrespect
But you're the kind of girl that'll make
A man stop and turn his head

[Chorus]
Don't want no sexual harassment
But I just can't help it
I got those elevator eyes, elevator eyes
As you go walkin' by girl
I say my oh my oh my
I got those elevator eyes, elevator eyes

[Verse 2 - Barrington "Bo" Henderson]
Your body foundation is really out of sight
Your hair and your clothes
Everything is just right
I inspect you like a general does his army
Close order drill girl
Girl, you're looking so damn charming
Repeat 1

[Bridge - Terry Weeks, Bo Henderson and Wanda Vaughn]
Girl, I know how a woman must feel
A woman wants respect for who she is
I still believe that a woman wants to be told
She's an angel of mercy(Just like you)
Full of surprises (Yes I am)
So full of love, there's no denying

Repeat 1 until fade

[Intro]
Hmm

Understand been around the block a few times
(You need to try) You need to try a love like mine

[Chorus]

Say you will accept the love that I bring
(The kind that makes you sing) kind that make you sing
I can fulfill your EACH and ev-er-y dream (every dream woman)
(I'll be your special thing) buy you diamond rings and furs and things (would you like that baby)
See I'm that man YOU'VE searched for all of your life
(Sure your right) and I know I'm right I know I'm right
Baby take my hand to our own paradise
(I know you like) a love like mine

[Chorus]
My love is
Proven and true (awww baby baby yeah)

[Bridge - Ron Tyson & "Bo" Henderson]
My love My love
I wanna give you everything you visualize
The night you cried I can satisfy you
Boom boom boom boom

I know you've been through ups and downs changes and turn arounds
Boom boom boom boom
So I'm coming to your rescue to give you my love

[Chorus]
My love is

[Intro]
Well, look like it's time for me to hit the road again
I guess I better check my bags and make sure I got everything I'm gonna need
'Cause it look like I'm gonna be gone a long time
Ha ha, guess I'm going to my second home

[Verse 1]
Some days, I feel alone
And the wind beneath my wings
Is running round the globe
I know the day would come when my days are done
So I'm gonna do my best to make it through
And do what I gotta do

[Chorus]
(Gotta get on the road)
Rolling
Rolling (Roll, roll, roll again)
Ain't no place I'd rather be (Rolling, rolling)
Than around here whеre my soul is chill

[Verse 2]
The wheels are turning fastеr everyday
Sooner I would be moving pictures
From my room and with the past
Now I'm all dressed up with somewhere to be
Got so many roads to choose
The friends you lose
And hours before I sleep

[Chorus]
(Gotta get on the road)
I'm your friendly highway man
And I'm on the road again
I'm rolling (Rolling, rolling)
Rolling
(Gotta get on the road)
I'm your friendly highway, oh yeah
I can feel the wind beneath my wings, oh yeah
Makes me feel good inside (Rolling, rolling)

[Bridge - Ron Tyson and Terry Weeks]
Don't you know there's nothing well, keeps going right
But I'm surely knowing (knowing)
Your love keeps me going (going)
And I keep on towing
Towing the lie
Darling don't you worry
I'll be home in a hurry
You know I know I gotta jump to you baby

[Chorus]
(Gotta get on the road)
When your love, your love
Your love seasons through me
I'm coming home
I can take all the head and low (Rolling, rolling)
When I'm on the road, yes I can
(Gotta get on the road)
Must be in my blood (On the road again)
'Cause I love travelling all around on the road
On the road (Rolling)
On the road (Rolling)

(Gotta get on the road)
Think I'm gonna roll on down to Atlanta
And get me one of those good old country meals
I'm gonna ride all up to Philadelphia (Rolling, rolling)
And say hello to all my family and friends
(Gotta get on the road)
And then I'm going to Detroit, West Grand Boulevard
'Cause you know that's where it started yo
Chicago, Chicago I'm on my way, I'm on the road again
LA
LA
I'm on my way
I'm on the road y'all
DC, I ain't no forget you y'all, coming your way too
I'm on the road again
New York
Sounds so nice, don't have to spell it twice
I'm on the road again
On the road, on the road, on the road, on the road again
I'm on the road, I'm on the road, on the road again

[Intro to Film: Lacrimosa by Mozart]

[Song 1 - Dark Fantasy]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Can we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oooh!
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Can we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Can we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (Higher, higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Oh

[Newscaster Woman, on the television]
- The company is introducing 

[unintelligible] strategies for the middling European market. Last year the company profited 340-million euros, which was a 5-percent raise. Fires are raging today, causing major damage in the local area forests. The specific cause is believed to be a comet that landed in the forests starting these fires. Local fire departments are working hard to control this situation. We are working to bring you more details in the hours to come

[Speaks in an Eastern-European Language]

[Kanye West]
- First rule in this world baby, don't pay attention to anything you see in the news

[Song 2 - Gorgeous]

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded

[Interlude 2]

[Kanye toys around with the samples used on POWER on his MPC2000XL]

[Song 3 - All of the Lights]

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Song 4 - Devil in a New Dress]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme," not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

[Interlude 4]

[Man]
- Your girlfriend is really beautiful

[Kanye West]
- (Laughs) Thank you

[Man]
- Do you know she's a bird?

[Kanye West]
- Nah, I never noticed that

[Man]
- I mean like, leave the monkey in the zoo

[Song 5 - Runaway]

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Bridge: Kanye West & Rick James]
Run away from me, baby
Ah, run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Then run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day, you just up and leave

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Song 6 - Hell of a Life]

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Selita Ebanks]
Turn the level up if you wanna (Wanna)

[The Phoenix screams for the rest of the verse over the vocals]
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

[The Phoenix continues to scream]

[Song 7 - Blame Game]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude 6]

[The Phoenix]
- Can I ask you a question?

[Kanye West]
- Of course, babe

[The Phoenix]
- All of the statues that we see, where do you think they came from?

[Kanye West]
- I think that, artists carved them, years and years ago

[The Phoenix]
- No. They are Phoenix turned to stone

[Kanye West]
- (Laughs) Baby, they-

[The Phoenix]
- They are Phoenix turned to stone. Do you know what I hate worst about your world? Anything that is different you try to change. You try to tear it down. You rip the wings off the Phoenix and they turn to stone. And if I don't burn, I will turn to stone

[Kanye West]
- What do you mean burn?

[The Phoenix]
- If I don't burn I can't go back to my world

[Kanye West]
- I don't want you to go back to your world. I want you to stay here with me

[The Phoenix]
- I have to burn

[Kanye West]
- No. I'll never let you burn

[Song 8 - Lost in the World]

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night
(Slow down the time), ooh
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night

[Verse: Kanye West]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West & Elly Jackson]
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
I'm new in the city
Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night, down for the night
Down for the night

[Bridge: Gil Scott Heron & Kanye West]
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night, down for a night
Oh-oh, get down

[Outro]

[Non-lyrical vocals]

[Song 9 - Who Will Survive in America]

[Verse: Gil Scott-Heron]
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

Lyrics from Snippet

You say you want me, then it's fuck me
'Til you fuck me, then tell me, "Never again"
And you ignore me 'til you're lonely
In the morning, you're saying "never again"
Yeah (yeah), hey
Gucci always talkin' 'bout he love somebody (hey, hey)
He don't love nobody (uh-uh, hey)
Matter fact, nigga, you owe me some money don't you? (Hey, hey)
Let me show you how I do this shit (get money)
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick (huh)
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch (brr)
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit (huh)
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit (brr)
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she supеr thick (huh)
And she act silly like a kid, give hеr candy stick (brr)
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick (huh)
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (brr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe (get in)
I stashed her in my Fendi wallet, stashed her in my tire (racks)
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar (huh)
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Calender Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singin' like Mariah
Singin' like the choir, better yet singin' like Mya (bitch)
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlers
I be wit all the ballers, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cookin' with yo' pots
I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)

(Nigga, you don't love me)
I know I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I think I love her
Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why? (Polow and drum, man)
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece in jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon appétit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat
Nigga always talk, but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have nots
My hoes pose with pots like Young Goldilocks
We got white bulgin' rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steamin' hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click-clack, p-pop-pop
I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I think I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
(Nigga, you don't love me)
I know I love her
(Nigga, you don't love me) yeah
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey, hey
I know I love her (uh-uh, hey)
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey, hey
(Nigga, you don't love me) hey, hey
I think I love her (hey, hey, hey, hey)

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float, white Ferrari
Had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central

I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

Stick by me, close by me
You were fine
You were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text to speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me
Eventually, eventually, yes
Ah, on me eventually, eventually, yes
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
Good times
In this life, life
In this life, life

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine

Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

[Verse]
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh, dream maker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Moon river and me

[Verse 1: Sia]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Verse 2: Sia]
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost towns and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium
Never enough
It's never enough, there never will be too much you
Never enough
It's never enough, I always leave wanting more

[Intro]
(Damn, Ryder)

[Chorus]
Damn, back like I never left
Every nigga hatin' suck a dick, put 'em on the shelf
Niggas didn't help when I was down, I don't need help
Fifty thousand dollars old hundreds look like sea kelp
Strappin' up your seat belt (Blatt)
In a coupe tryna figure out how D felt
Yeah, big diamonds in my ears look like sea shells
Couple millions dollars unclaimed in my email

[Verse]
Oh, now you wanna see me?
Ridin' round late night with a star like LAPD
Big flights, ain't even left the home, we be geeked
Everything we do bе in 3D (Blatt)
I want Vlone
Six hoes, no phones
Sleepin' with that chromе, I ain't lackin', never
Big FN tucked in my Coogi sweater
Ayy, get the fuck off my dick though
Truth be told, we was the first ones on Rick though
Uh, heard what you said, you not slick, ho
Not Big Bank, but we'll make this a shit show (Boom)

[Chorus]
Damn, back like I never left
Every nigga hatin' suck a dick, put 'em on the shelf
Niggas didn't help when I was down, I don't need help
Fifty thousand dollars old hundreds look like sea kelp
Strappin' up your seat belt (Blatt)
In a coupe tryna figure out how D felt
Yeah, big diamonds in my ears look like sea shells
Couple millions dollars unclaimed in my email

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
All I got left is a four, I'ma drink it slow
I tote a big .223, pinch that baby nose
I give a fuck 'bout politics, I just play my role
I drunk three pints before gym, still be looking swole
I put red dot on his face like your mama mole
All I done did, I should move into a commode
Bad boujee bitch off IG suck a nigga soul
Drac' by my side, like a Glock, no, I could never fold
Broke nigga mad 'cause I'm rich and I fuck more hoes
Lil' bitch still touring round my house, we gon' cut her toes
What happened to that one nigga? Shit, we'll never know
House so damn big, at the end, it's a pot of gold
Heard how they move when they goal is to wipe my nose
My nose too dry, if it's wet, someone gotta go
I might max out off that X, God was speaking back
Niggas hit my (Huh?), and took my (Shh), I won't play with that
I'll pay for spinners 'fore I pay for that **** back
**** tote a five, stepper with that mac
Pouring up this Quagen, fuck around and have a heart attack
Slime had a drought in they spot like an architect
Arc'teryx jacket cost a rack, it ain't never match
Matching with my whips like I'm Tip, I keep twenty straps
Niggas freaking out, I keep calm 'cause it's under wraps
Riding with that SIG, bullets big, it could kill a calf
Cup filled with red like it's going down statistics graph
Graduated from school and the only thing I actually use is math

[Verse 2: DC2Trill]
Carat each diamond, gold AP, nigga, do the math (Yeah)
She been sucking dick for three hours, she need to take a bath (Yeah)
Matsuhisa, ate fire wagyu when I eat the calf
Trackhawk with the wide body, it's gon' leave the tags (Whew)
Finna find them niggas who took that (Shh), I'ma get 'em (Brrt)
Your nigga testified and you still with him, that make you a rat
I poured a six of the Keisha, that's gon' bring me back (I poured a six)
I just pulled up in a car that you could never have
Spinning his block, so we leaving the cellphone
Buy some Rick and go to Chrome
Getting cash, ain't ever home
With my Glock, I'm not alone
You not legit, not fucking with you
It's just us, get out the picture
Do it, bet that chopper stick 'em
Screw it, let's go handle business

[Verse 3: Draft Day]
Yeah
Now she see that you got motion, she want all forgiveness
When that light wasn't on me, I know you weren't paying attention
I'm tryna run up these Ms and quadruple that
Niggas say they be in the gym, but we ain't seen a stack
White and gold bust-down Cartiers, it's a yay party
I'm always on time with this shit, you can ask Ashanti
I could talk that Three Six talk, why that syrup got me?
And I know that I'm godbody, we made like John Gotti
Concrete Boys, niggas know it's us, they ain't seen what we seen
Boat just pulled up in that double M, it was one of fifteen
All my niggas stand fucking tall on everything they mean
You niggas hide behind the cameras, your life behind the scenes

[Outro: Draft Day]
Boy
Phew, phew, phew
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, mafia
Yeah, mafia
Yeah, mafia

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
I'ma pop up, mm

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I'ma up two hundred racks just because I can
Fuckin' up a sack with this sack 'cause a nigga can
I'ma put a dub on your mans if I don't like his look
Beatin' up that pussy, hit that shit with an uppercut (Go)
Ten gold chains on my neck like I'm King Tut
Walkin' 'round this bitch tight shirt with a lean gut (Blatt)
Fuckin' on this bitch, kind of ugly, but her booty big
Nigga cannot talk to me wrong, fuck who he is (Damn)
Concrete Boys disturb the peace like I'm Ludacris (Damn)
Tight flow, sippin' on Wock' in a poncho (Ooh)
Not Quavo, but I'm still the head honcho (Yeah)
Gettin' some top from this bitch with a monster throat
Iced out in New York, below freezin', 30K coat (Brr)
Nigga wanna rock with the boys, gotta pledge oath
Let me get this right, niggas mad that I fucked they ho? (Go)
50K cash to Elon Musk for a Tesla quote

[Verse 2: DC2Trill & Lil Yachty]
Invite that bitch straight to the mansion just to use hеr throat (Phew)
I'm on a PJ gettin' high, you don't know how that go (Damn)
How the fuck that bitch say I wifеd her up? I passed her to the bro
Why the fuck you always gettin' high with nowhere to go? (Uh)
Yes, I stay with blue strips, but I'm not a loc (Yeah)
Peter Piper, Pepper, I could never kept her (Phew)
Came here strictly for the cash, not the lecture (Yeah)
Lil' bitch pickin' up my cup, I'm like, "Hold on" (Yeah)
Feel somethin' like the Hot Boyz, I get my roll on
Tonka truck filled with the gas, he finna bag it in
Like the streetlights came on, I'm finna get it in
Yeah, this ho cool, but I'm tryna fuck her friend (Yeah)
I'm on an island like Ja Rule, we gettin' lit again
Bet a hundred she get a burger, not no Benihana
Lean dumper, the rap slow, then the fiends comin'
Give me the ball, I'll do great, got a mean jumper (Go)

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Bitch came in demanding dick, she's a mean woman (Mhm)
Late night, eyes wide open like I seen somethin' (Seen)
I'll take her to the back and get to bustin, bustin'
Told her think again before she think I'm the one to put trust in (Go)
Woke up inside a bitch I hit and started loudly cussin'
Should have checked her face, but ass was fat, so that was all Gucci
All this ice around my neck, I'm Kristi Yamaguchi
Shipped it bagged, it wasn't za, I told that nigga, "Sue me" (Don't)
Italian ice mixed with the Wock', I'm finna make a smoothie (Yeah)
Yeah, that brothers starvin', that's my favorite movie (Go)
Walk around with sixty CCs to Legends Jewelry (Swing)
Gun on my hip, I guess that's why they think I'm Lil Uzi
Prayin' clips and now we makin' movies, let's get straight to it
Lord of the beans
Gave this bitch a G6 and now she got wings

[Verse 4: DC2Trill]
I don't worry 'bout these niggas, I just do my thing
I'm on vacation up in Kingston, pour my drink in ting
I'ma fuck this lil' bitch, I'm on to better things
God damn, she too geeked up, she done took a bean
Mhm, came in this bitch with some rich fiends
Lil' mama, you know you broke as fuck, so why you talk to me?
Me and Cousin Skeeter on a boat, we're tryna catch some things
I made my life a dream just like Doctor King
Me and Boat got twin rings, nigga, bling, bling
I'm finna get Mei Ling a flight straight from Beijing
I got red put up, that shit aging
Perkies for the party, lean for the party
Drank Baby voice, I'm high, Carti

Vroom, don't be alarmed, that's the Hellcat getting started

[Outro: DC2Trill]
Ha-ha-ha-ha

Ask me, I've been on a roll, finna start preaching like Joel (Uh)
No matter how comfortable I get, still keep my pole (Blatt)
The more money that I make, the less that I trust these hoes (Yeah)
Just cause you comin' around, don’t think you can call me bro (Nah)
We start thumbin' it down, we start thumbin' it down (Thumbin' it down)

Them niggas out there ain't got love for you like me, my nigga (Yeah)
You my brother, I got your back, you know I’m gon’ deliver (Yeah)
Put it on God, whatever you need, give my brother my liver (It's us)
Cross me once, never again, told the bitch, "Cry me a river"
2015, we was in that basement, feelin’ like Tigger (God)

We are dead friends, but it's all the same
Promise I remember your face, just can't remember your name

[Verse 3: Boo]
Yeah, I'm hoppin' out the range wit the seats piped out
You can still see my chain even when the lights out (Lights out)
'Cause that's how mobsters do it
Spit a little game, give 'em that flossin' music
I'm the man from the C-H-I
These lames runnin' 'round thinkin' they so fly
Got a little buzz, but Boo been too high
I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick
I tell her, "Holler at Jeezy if you wanna pop Cris"
Get at Gucci Mane, 'cause he on some hood shit
And you know I'm in the cut, grippin' my .45

We just takin all your chicks, buyin' drinks, gettin' blunted
Groupies, show you how to do this, son
We throwin' out hundreds while you savin them ones, nigga

[Bridge: Lil' Will]
I got so many rocks, in my chain and watch

[Chorus]
There was time taken out from me
To do things that I couldn't see
This doesn't seem to be a place for me
In the size of your bigger scheme
So baby call off

Now you've started messin' with my mind
That must have been your plan all the time
You must have thought that I was blind
I didn't gave to look that hard to find
So baby call off

So now we know the final score
I've got no time to play your games
Don't think that I can take it anymore
Why don't you take your bags and hit
So baby call off

[Verse 1]
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, uh
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' sh** to say, ay-ay-oh

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-ee

[Verse 2]
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (I think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career (eh)
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, I-I-I
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
No, no, no

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, ah-ah

[Outro]
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
I think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars

[Verse 1]
Hanging on minutes
It's you and me versus the sun
Don’t wanna finish
It feels good, it's too good
This is religious, my body's speaking in tongues
I won't forget this, it feels good, it's too good

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't stop time (Time), but we got all night long
Baby, you're always mine (Mine)
Distance don't mean you're gone (Gone)

[Chorus]
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep

[Verse 2]
We got emotions all over, I don't know where
I reach for the open, you're not here, not here
Replay all the moments
Breathe you like you're air
Used to let my focus so clear, so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't stop time (Time), but we got all night long
Baby, you’re always mine
Distance don’t mean you’re gone (Gone)

[Chorus]
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep

[Bridge]
Don't think about the time
Don't think about goodbye
Right here, right now
There's nothing stopping us from this love
Don't think about the time
Don't think about goodbye
Right here, right now
There's nothing stopping us from this love

[Chorus]
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep
You don't ever leave me
Never out of reach
Always here when you need
When you need reminding (Oh-oh-oh)
Touch your heart, I'm right here (Oh-oh-oh)
We go, we go deep
We go, we go deep

[Verse 1]
I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh, yeah)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to makе me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just likе this

[Verse 2]
Used to be too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish shit was different than what it was (Oh, yeah)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Even if it's not for real
Stay the night
Only got you for a short time
Going through a hard time
Hoping you could carry my demons part time (My demons, oh)
Asking too much past the basics
Too much, just stay

[Verse 1]
Could it be we're just not right for each other?
You say, "I bare the noose"
We fuck her over, think of wondering to myself
How I ruin it this time? Why try?
But you know you're fucking with a diamond
Lost the shine, then do it justice, baby, ew
Heard you tryna build with a new bitch
Give a front, I don't need this now
I can't take no chances when you're manic
You gon' make me go and get my bros on you
Bows on you
Running across my mind it's kinetic
Connect to you, whеre it is
Ain't no fucking with my timing, yeah, yeah
Closеd on Sunday, gotta get that good God in
Sinning by Monday, you hit it from the side
I can't stand the way you treat me
Can't stand to watch you leave

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Even if it's not for real
Stay the night
Only got you for a short time
Going through a hard time
Hoping you could carry my demons part time
Asking too much past the basics
Too much, just stay

[Verse 2]
I miss you the most when my side do me dirty
I might be a hoe but you match so it's okay
I put you on hold, for the money, I can't play
You so touch and go, I can't tell if it's all fake
These bitches don't know you ain't shit, but I won't say
Secret safe with me, fuck in the back of the jeep
Fuck when you had no sheets
How you mad at me? I'm your battery
You should bow to me
Baby girl, you know what they say
"You ain't getting used, then you're fucking useless"
Must be a dummy by the way you do me
Coulda got some money, shoulda utilized me
But this too late, and I'm so straight
And them old ways, and we cold case
I tap into the mmm, weed, yeah
You talking all that shit but I ain't see no real yet
Is you calm?

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Even if it's not for real
Stay the night
Only got you for a short time
Going through a hard time
Hoping you could carry my demons part time
Asking too much past the basics
Too much, just stay

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You was cruisin' with your top down, fourth of July
I was movin' down the block, we got caught at the light
Out my window, I was shootin' my shot
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
In the summers, we let the top down, soak up the light
All I wanted was just to lock down the love of my life
Nice an' simple, like a midnight drive
Watchin' fireworks in the sky

[Chorus]
I'm calling it now, I'm calling it now, I'm calling it now
You'll find love with me somehow, yeah, somehow

Life is simple, 'long as you in my life
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
In the summers, we spent the nights makin' love in the park
We was buzzin' off cherry wine, lookin' up at the stars
Soft and blissful, how you feel in my arms

Keys on the drеsser my money in a great place where I could never tell yea
Cinderella story call me cinder fella I make it rain so much the strippers gotta
Bring umbrellas I double spike the punch skip breakfast and lunch

And bae I don't do dutch I let her order what she won't order what you must

[Rocko:]
A thay didn't thank I would be back I told them wait and watch
All you weight watches kick back and factor this omega ain't no comming after this
We the realest niggas coming from Atlanta street ya'll thought atlanta rap was all
Novelty (where you was at) I was in the trenches trying to escape probity
Or probably out selling sack or probably trying to figure out where the fuck you hang yo sack at
Way before I was hitten sack 5ave (what you was doing) I was on the avenue picking quarter
And taking orders from no nigga but the consumers (what you is) I'm a zone 4 nigga I hid the meals up in my room (n my draws)
These niggas grew up with a silver spoon I had a dusty folk you had to learn to wiggle up jus to get it up
Niggas playing cards in the hood but I ain't playing hell I will throw in my hand if I hand ya'll hand
And niggas a cut off they hand jus to have my hand I'm that nigga now look at you you throw dealing
Purple sent lergederment yea I'm threw dealing my name whole wait I carry my own weight

Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Verse 1]
We kissed in the morning on a summer day
You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes
There's a warning written in the corners of your face
Whiplash and you left me in a vapour trail
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
(You said) You fell in love, but you don't know how
We were good once, but I'm fucked up now
(You said) I was dumb, trying to work things out
I built a house and you burned it down

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what wе had

[Verse 2]
Just a minute now, there's somеthing different now
All your morning sounds, how's it all so loud?
Put the flowers down 'cause they look like clowns
Leave me to it then and let your hair grow out
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway

[Chorus]
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past, baby
Don't wanna talk, baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Hustle, Hustle, it's all about the hustle

Working in my trap house doin' lotta numbers
She ain't got no money, girl, it's a lotta gumble
Smoking on good shit, ice like Alaska

Feel the tide dying & they actin' wit your daughter
Clean go nasty, just to go charge her
Pull up in the Honda, bitch due summer
Fall off in thе club, dog, ain't know frontin'

[Verse 1]
Once a buncha times I took it too hard
Everything you told me I took it apart
I pulled you in and pushed you out right from the start
I was leaving before I'd arrived

[Verse 2]
Eyes are magnetic, that moldavite flame
Stopping the traffic, all six lanes
You're callin' me baby, barely sayin' my name
I was leaving before I'd arrived

[Chorus]
Half a margarita, have a little dance
Let's fine dine the demons and give peace a chance

[Verse 3]
On a Tuesday in August, I was holdin' your hand
By Wednesday in August, I was playin' with my band
Then Thursday in August, I was makin' a plan
Thеn I shut like a shuttered Friday

[Verse 4]
Your lips arе electric like lightning and rain
Your tastes are eclectic, multigrain
You pull on my shoestrings and you open my brain
But I was leaving before I'd arrived

[Chorus]
Half a margarita, have a little dance
Let's fine dine the demons and give peace a chance

[Verse 5]
We could talk for hours, I could buy you flowers
We could switch off in the movies, we could switch off in showers
We can turn it up (up), turn it down (down), watch Austin Powers
But I was leaving before I'd arrived

[Verse 6]
I'm fairly good at takin' a small thing and blowin' it up real big
I couldn't fit it in my wallet, I couldn't fit it in my rig
I can twist it in, twist it out, can really dig
About leavin' before I'd arrived

[Chorus]
Half a margarita, have a little dance
Let's fine dine the demons and give peace a chance

[Verse 7]
You believe in me some, you believe in me a lot
You see all the good things I seem to've forgot
You can cheer me up and calm me down, you know the spot
You say "Honey won't you stay a little while?"

[Verse 8]
You can make me smile just by lookin' around
You take me to the invisible lost and found
Where I can find a sweater or an old love letter
About leaving before I'd arrived

[Verse 9]
We can flapjack a nickel, pancake a dime
Waffle a tickle, french toast wine
We can take in bacon, sunshine
Tee off with a coffee and a tan

[Chorus]
Half a margarita, have a little dance
Let's fine dine the demons and give peace a chance
Half a margarita, have a little dance
Let's fine dine the demons and give peace a chance
I say lets fine dine the demons and save all the ants

[Verse 1]
Name on the line, last request
Pull the car over to find some rest
Saying "I love you"
Need to lie here, need to leave
Living in the debt of make-believe
Saying I owe you
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
Shadow from the grass in the dirt on the lawn
Why do I string you along?

[Chorus]
My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plain
In the future

[Verse 2]
Sit on the phone, watch TV
Romance, action, mystery
Wanted to show you
Sine wave is a particle ride
Bring your light out, then in on the tide
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you is a river so high
Maybe I love you is a river so low
I love you, still don't know

[Chorus]
My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the future

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plain
In the future

[Verse 1]
It's a little bit magic
Like a river of morning geese
In the new warm mountain
Where the stone face forms and speaks

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

[Verse 2]
When the topsoil
Is kicking up into the storm
And the dust goes dancing
And a billion planets are born

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

[Chorus]
Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

[Break]

[Verse 3]
There's a dragon in thе phone line
Coughing up a mighty flame
With a tonguе of silver, silver
Calling out my oldest name

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "Hey, you
Do you remember me too?"
We were coiling

[Outro]
It's a little bit magic
Magic
A little bit magic
Magic

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]

If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hi" with a bunch of I's
Or "Hey" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Sharper than the sword, wanna do me in
Was it somethin' I said? Well, it usually is
Conscience of subs, I call that subconscious

We grew up in this algorithm track
So if it's one for love, I need to get the one back

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]

What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, huh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, huh
Lyrics from Snippets

[Chorus]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
I read about a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse]
Sittin' by myself I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreaming (Jesus)
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Lord)
I watched so many people leavе (Lord)
I seen them change by the sеason, that's mama's seasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce you at the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just goes unnoticed (Jesus)
And they tell you that you good, to just stay focused (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear, you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' niggas, since niggas was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long go to the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tales, when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, when everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying, cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy was stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen and pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she was feeling nauseous, like she finna throw up
The water flows down the lakes, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, the big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside
He even let him get the last meal, he done with the streets after this, this his last kill
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "Nigga, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
The big bro just blacked out and all you seeing was the light (Jesus, Lord)

[Chorus]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
I read about a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Sia]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]

Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall

You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

Lyrics from Snippet

...With your boys, that shit is old news
Told that bitch that I can't trust her as far as I can throw you
Ho, shut the fuck up, I thought that I told you
Money over everything, you don't even come close to it
Up, up, up, I get so high that I get stuck...

[Verse 1]
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let thеm be
Some boys try, and some boys liе
But I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Interlude]
Living in a material world (-Terial)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (-Terial)

[Verse 3]
Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Outro]
A material, a material, a material, a material world

[Verse: Mk.gee]
Gave me back my peace of mind
Think about it all the time
Call your name, you walk away
Never here when you should stay
Mmm

[Verse: Madeleine Mayi]
Don't let out the things you give
How am I supposed to give
There's still fire, can't you see?
When you look at me

[Chorus: Mk.gee & Madeleine Mayi]
At me

[Verse: Madeleine Mayi]
How come when I need you most
Can't seem to pick up the phone
Nowadays, things seem strange
Those brown eyes, I think they've changed
And those

[Verse: Mk.gee]
Maybe it comes back to me
It could have done 

[?]
It's not the same, not how it should be
When you look at me

[Chorus: Mk.gee & Madeleine Mayi]
At me
Orange clouds out my window
Sunlight beats through my room
I don't mind the alone time
Helps me keep you off my mind

Who am I to judge me
I'm just getting lonely
All the waves have shown me
This ain't what I used to be

Raindrops and 

[?] leaves
No one knows what I mean
All the people with their
Thinking minds
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't—

Who am I to judge me
I'm just getting lonely
All the waves have shown me
This ain't what I used to be

[Outro]
I do not mind
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
Just a thick soul
Something that you just don't know
Things will never be the same
Crazy how one night can change me

Heard it through the grapevine
Someone took what was mine
Time's slipping through my hands
Your eye fixed on another mans

And
Took my hand, threw it down
Each for you, but 

[?] out
Warm, the touch, growing cold
Says this thing is getting old

And I—, I—
Oh, I, I
Oooh, uh

Can't you see all—
You belong with me
Can't you see all—
With me, with me
With me, with me

[Paul McCartney]
Is anyone sort of thinking at this like making an album or more like sort of doing a lot of numbers, then to be able to play them all one after the other? 'Cause I'm still thinking—

[George Martin]
I'm thinking half to play them and half like an album

[George Harrison]
I'm thinking half we return to record them and if we then—

[John Lennon]
You know, say, say we did half of them this Thursday and then they didn't have to film the next lot of rehearsals or whatever

[Paul McCartney]
Yeah

[John Lennon]
And we do another lot and do them in the same place, you know
If we can't—
It's just that we can't learn another five or six good for Thursday
We just got "Don't Let Me Down" and "I've Got A Feeling" just how they should be when we hit it

[Intro]
Good morning

Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door

But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

My character's breaking
Thought I had this memorized

Center stage from someone else?
Why's it still feel like I'm faking
When I'm starring as myself?

[Verse 2]
Got three more hours back from LA
And my Nissan's breaking down
Grab a replacement on the way
Got money for it now
Welcome to spotlit vacation
Where the silence grows like trees
I'm fielding congratulations
While I'm choking on the leaves

Should I keep on searching?
(Is this really all there is? I try)
I'm trying to turn in
(What if I already did?)
To I

They say the mind's a good servant
As a master, it is fucked
Convinced it's gotta be perfect
No such thing as good enough
You got a head full of what-ifs
And it's keeping you afloat
And you've got better days coming
Doesn't mean they're tomorrow

[Chorus]
Should I keep on searching?
(Is this really all there is? I try)
I'm trying to turn in
(What if I already did?)
To I
To I (If I already did, if I already did, I'm scared that I already did)
To try (I'm scared that I already did, I'm scared that I already did)
To try (I'm scared that I already did, I'm scared that I already did)
Lyrics from IGTV Live

[Intro]
Pa, la, pa
A million, a million

[Verse]
My life is just one big puzzle that's broken into a million pieces
I’ve been tryna sequence it gets hard as shit
Bruising the one you love, done shared a million things with
When I'm done they'll probably put my bones in museums
Like that’s one of the last from niggas, ever
'Cause at this rate we'll all be extinct then
I got a hole in my heart that I hate when I sink in
She spend a night with me and now she want a million weekends
Shallow hoes always fallin' in love with the deepest
I'm in the deep end
My city population eight hunnid thou'
But on my block alone you'll find a million pieces
And that's why we 

[?], dawg
Are you tryna test us or cheat us?
Or if we don’t like the way you treat us
Or might just be in a season
I used to wanna be a millionaire for shit like a million reasons
And then it came with a million leechers
That want that many pieces
Lawyer’s taxes, state taxes, agents, assistants, baby's managers
Fees and damages, plus somebody else to make sure that they’re not scammin' us
Shit have you depressed checkin' your balances
Luckily it's me, I know how to balance it
My dad says his dream to be actin’
But it never happened
And when he talks 'bout back then, it breaks me to a million pieces

[Chorus]
A million, a million
A million pieces
Pa, pa, pa
Pa, pa-pa, pa
Pa, la, pa

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
This is dog for life, somethin' you don't know about
No pot to piss in, no window to throw it out
You know what we do to bitch-ass niggas, we ho 'em out
You ain't gotta worry 'bout the score, we gon' blow 'em out
Earl, David, Jason, gotta be Sean
Gots to keep on keepin' up, I gotta get on
In the hood right now when the economy strong
These my niggas that I'm talkin' 'bout, follow the song (Listen)
Yeah, everybody wanna be down, they playin' spades
To me, all y'all niggas is clowns playin' charades (Clowns)
You hit a couple chicks in the town, playin' with AIDS
It's hot over there, my nigga, play in the shade
You see, we playin' with bullets, y'all playin' with blades
No handguns, we all playin' with Ks (Brrt)
For one of these niggas, I'll come with fuckin' grenades (Boom)
Exactly how many times do I have to say

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Sheek Louch]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)

That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go), ayo

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
We ain't cool like that, homie, we barely even talk (Facts)
Every rapper ain't close 'cause they comin' out New York
I ain't get a call from you when my mom was in the morgue
Or a nigga needed money, so how the fuck is you my dog?
Got a lil' older, seen shit for what it was
Yeah, I known you longer, but I like him for what he does
No talk, .38 revolver just because
Straight liquor, that cranberry fuckin' up my buzz
That's my dog, yeah, we done got it off the ground
Turned it to Ruff Ryders, gave niggas a new sound
You heard I was from Yonkers like it was a new town
I'm lookin' at these labels, like, "Who the fuck is these new clowns?"
Silverback, nigga, can't wait for me to fall
Same time, their bitches can't wait for me to call
These hatin' motherfuckers I be tryin' to avoid
Let's do it for Breonna, let's do this shit for Floyd

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
You can feel the love or all the evil that men do
Either playin' God or a dog that needs a menu
I was born a wolf, my nigga, let me continue
Come from a town where niggas fly out the window
Either they got thrown or the dust did it
Nah, the knife didn't kill him, but the rust did it
Lookin' at the new McLaren, need a clutch in it
That gun probably got a homi', but I fucks with it (I fucks with it)
All these niggas been my dogs since the lowlife days (My dogs)
Got a forty-five, shit'll probably blow like haze
You don't want a homi', you should let me go my way
I'm like Doughboy, you gon' wanna roll like Tre (Yeah)
All my niggas know the ticket on the heroin price
Every bar that I say is sort of like Klondike (Hah)
Yeah, that's cold motherfucker, get a hold motherfucker (Get a hold)
That's my dog, if he asked, I'll take your soul motherfucker

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

[Verse 4: DMX]
It just takes one shot from one gun by one dude
A reason to get it, what's up? Then fuck you
You know how a nigga move, it's how a nigga move
Fuckin' snake, you shoulda ate when your plate had food
I'ma say what the fuck I want, let it do what it do
And wherever the fuck you at, nigga, we comin' through
I ain't playin' with you niggas, I got kids your age
I ain't your father that shoulda stayed, too late, you shoulda prayed
You ain't know, motherfucker? I'm from the home of the brave
Where we played in the mountains 'cause we lived in a cave
When I came into the game, I crashed through the wave
I'm the best, somethin' that I'm takin' to the grave
Motherfuckers' jeans is too tight to be fuckin' with dog
So stop fuckin' with me, 'cause I ain't fuckin' with y'all
I might have dropped the ball, but I got it right back
My man dove for the out of bounds save and shot it right back

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Dog)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Oh), that's my dog, yeah (Yeah)
That's my dog, yeah, yeah, that's my dog, yeah (Here we go)

[Post-Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes
Do it for the have-nots, do it for the lowlifes (Yeah)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
That's my dog, yeah, yeah (Bounce), that's my dog, yeah (Bounce)

Everyday it gets darker (Rrr), the road gets longer (Rrr)
My body gets weaker (Rrr), my faith gets stronger (Rrr)

As long as I'm in His graces, it's gon' get ugly (Hey)
But, only He can judge mе so

That way I ain't gotta splatter with the rat-tat-tatta (Woo)

Man, if you not able to see

Ah (Right), ah

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 1: DMX]
Whenever I went through something, it brought me closer to God (Come on)
And I stayed in somethin', so now I'm closer to God (Come on), but
Close to his heart 'til the attacks get stronger (Uh-huh)
Become much harder to fight and they last longer (Yeah)
That's what it's always been, joy with the pain (Ooh)
Dark with the light (Ooh), sun with the rain (What?), but
With the right perspective there's somethin' to gain
Look for the good in the bad, like the sun when it rains

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers, skyscrapers

[Verse 2: DMX]
I don't like better, better get you comfortable (Uh-huh)
Comfort puts you to sleep, need to know what's up with you (What?)
Hate and love relationship, but what I love (Yeah)
Hate it because it kills me, love it for what it does (Why?)
Every day I live (Ugh), every day I die (Ugh)
Don't always laugh (Ugh), but every day I cry (What?)
Used to wonder why, now I enjoy the rain (Ahh)
Get stronger with the struggle, can't live without the pain (What?)
I just wanna be heard, fuck the fame (Yeah)
My words will live forever (Come on), fuck my name
Father God, please give me the strength I need
I was born in the dirt, so it's like you planted the seed, let me grow

[Chorus: Bono]
I've seen coal turn to diamonds
And blind man's visions become skyscrapers
What began as a seed is no longer a dream
Let's become skyscrapers

[Bridge: Bono & DMX]
Put your hands high and touch the sky (Huh, huh, huh)
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers
Put your hands high and touch the sky (Huh, huh, huh)
Put your hands high and touch the skyscrapers (Rrr)
Breezes in the summer comet sky
And jungle city lights go flashing by
Feel full of—
Feel full, full

[Outro: DMX]

On all fours, red wine with a blue rose
Shit cool, a Pitbull with a red nose
Man, it's so hectic
I slip out and slip back in to redirect it, connect it

Playing with my heart, man, that's a dangerous game (For real)
Put this dick up in your stomach, have you saying my name
Have you like (Ayy, papi) nothing gon' stop me
I'll gorilla-fuck that ass, leave the pussy sloppy
Sucker for love, not me, I ain't that nigga
Send you back to your baby father, hatin' that nigga

Because he’s not me, you know I
Would never be that nigga that's home watching the kids
While my wife was in the street sucking another nigga dick, damn

[Verse 1: DMX]
Look here, I grew up with the thing, hard living (Uh-huh)
Found out the source of the pain God givin' (Ooh)
He left me with no shelter in the rain
But I learned to stay dry, so it wasn't in vain
Every time you go through somethin', there's somethin' to gain
And you only truly suffer if you remain the same (Come on)
Let the dirt you go through change you (What?)
Don't forget, even Satan was an angel
You can't go through life walkin' blind
Gotta not only speak your heart but talk your mind (Uh)
One thing lead to another (Yeah)
How I get down is I will bleed for my brother (What?)
Man, I'm a different nigga (Man)
I'ma say it once (Please stop) all that riffin', nigga (Woo)
For the sake of all the people that love you, I'm a goon (Man)
Leave your family in the park lettin' go of balloons
We miss you

[Bridge: dEnAun]
I don't always get my share of roses
For me, sunny days are always comin', goin'
I know we all got our share of trials and tribulations, yeah
But I done rode for some of y'all
When you ain't even have a ride yourself
So tell me why I'm walkin', walkin', walkin'?

[Chorus: DMX & dEnAun]
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr (Walkin')

[Verse 2: Nas]
We in the new dark ages
We reject who we really are, adaptation
Accept no cheap imitations
I am the streets meet civilization, police precinct 114 chased him
Who should be held accountable
For the hell I encountered just explorin' the town I knew?
You pray a predator choose, I fared better than many
Y'all fear some career gun-slangin' youngsters
Coulda went to war, probably wouldn't have overcome it
I coulda been still bitter now, 'cause there's no middle ground
Locked up juveniles make grown men doubt
Made me wanna get myself knocked in jail just to get you inside
Can't even wait 'til you get out to air you out
As a teen, it's just a few things I cared about
Facts, I made it, impact behavior like the eternal flame
In Martin Luther's grave, yeah, gotta keep burnin', unabated
Turn a man to a millionaire
Just to tell you how good that my day went
My life should be an Ava DuVernay flick
Denzel plays a younger Nas with some CGI
If you rock with your day ones, bless
If you do not, don't let it stress
There's friends I only see once a year
Nothing changed, love is there
Some brothers you outgrow, you leave 'em there, yeah

[Chorus: DMX & dEnAun]
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the rain
Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Huh, walkin' in the, rrr
Walkin', walkin', walkin'

[Outro: DMX & Exodus Simmons]
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain
Walkin' in the rain

[Intro: DMX]
Huh, rrr (Woo)
Ooh, rrr
This is one of those
You already know what it is
Rrr

[Verse: DMX]
Dear son, I look in your eyes, I see my own
You look in my eyes, you see my throne
As many times I tried to talk to you, explain to you
See it didn't mean a thing to you
Love you, but right now I wanna bite you
I wanna give you a hug, but I might bite you
Be a man about it, we can admit when we're wrong
Come on, get off that kid shit you on
If you'd have paid attention, you'd have saw it coming
But you a man lookin' through the eyes of a woman
Always gon' love your mama (Always), we just drifted apart
And my kids, y'all my heart
And you got more brothers and sisters
Because I got more kids, and hey, it's just what it is
You the oldest, I known you longer, but I don't love them less
Had to get that off my chest
And I don't know what you thought about my use of drugs
But it taught you enough to not use them drugs
When you were a kid, you play with toys, okay
But you a man, put them toys away
What I'm saying is stop thinkin' like a child
'Cause what if it's when I'm gone (Damn)
That you gotta realize you're wrong? (Damn)
And we could've been best of friends all along
But it would kinda defeat the purpose of the song
917-915-4804
Give me a call, I love you boy (That's the truth, call me)

[Chorus: Usher]
Yeah, ay, I let you down
Should've been there but I let you down
Not too late, not too late
I can't give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late, it ain't too late
Call your father
Call your father

[Bridge: Brian King Joseph]
Dear father, should've been there when I needed you
Should've been there when the devil had a hold of your soul
(Hold of your soul, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Usher]
Ayy, I let you down
Should've been there but I let you down
Not too late, not too late (Not too late)
I can't give you yesterday
But I can learn from my mistakes
Not too late, it ain't too late
Call your father
Call your father

[Verse 1]
Day off in Kyoto
I got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
I went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a pay phone
They still got pay phones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming in through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changеd my mind (Woo)

[Post Chorus: María Reál]
You look so pretty
Someone should tеll me
Tell me to stay

[Verse 2]
Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chemtrails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it?
Twenty-five felt like flying

[Chorus]
I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

[Outro: María Reál & Phoebe Bridgers]
You look so pretty (Guess I lied)
Someone should tell me
Tell me to stay (I'm a liar)
You look so pretty
Someone should tell me (Who lies)
Tell me to stay
You look so pretty ('Cause I'm a liar)
Someone should tell me
Tell me to stay
You look so pretty
Someone should tell me

[Intro]
We're gonna get a bit more romantic
You know
I heard it's the right place

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's my sweet
My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to my mummy
Weren't allowed in the park
Exiled, couldn't even do one keepie uppie
The cars on my road almost see me in a hurry
The cars are just a sign of another yuppie
Down in the dirt
I used to surf with my bucket from Kentucky
I had a scratch card, I scratched so hard
'Cause I'm feelin' fuckin' lucky, boy, I'm feelin' so lucky
On my tenth birthday, got a puppy
Now I'm back in the park with the middle class yobs
Tryna get lucky
I was little once more
Weed smoke made me feel so yucky
Pullin' on my brain, born
Another fuckin' junkie, born
Another fuckin' scum, torn apart
I was little once more

[Chorus]
Stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm high again
Oh, I'm low again, boy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she's my sweet
My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home, right back to her, back to her
Down in a high
I used to pick you up
I used to, ah
I used to pick me, ah

[Chorus]
Stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
Oh, I'm high again, boy

[Outro: Archy, & Heckler]
How you doin' Archy?
Yeah, I'm alright
Yeah!
Erm

[Verse 1]
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out now

[Chorus]
She was a day tripper (Day tripper, yeah)
A one way ticket, yeah (One way ticket, yeah)
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 2]
She's a big teaser
She led me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She led me half the way there now

[Chorus]
She was a day tripper
A Sunday driver, yeah (Sunday driver)
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 3]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands

[Chorus]
She was a day tripper (Day tripper, yeah)
A one way ticket, yeah (One way ticket, oh now)
It took me so long
To find out (But I found out), and I found out

[Outro]
Day tripper
Day tripper
Day tripper
Day tripper
Day tripper (I got what you need)
Day tripper
Day tripper (I got what you need, girl)
Day tripper (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 2]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I think you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to join along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 1]
Stayin' up 'til the A.M
Call you out on all your bullshit
Whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff
It was sweet before the fall
You and I got comfortable quick
But whenever it's convenient for ya
You remember all the good stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

[Chorus]
If you want me 'causе you heard somebody mention my namе
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number
You got the wrong number

[Verse 2]
When you're thinking of the end
You're only hearin' me say, "I love ya"
You don't hear the door you slammed after
You remember all the good stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
You are forgetting we fell apart
I mean, look where we are
You are remembering everything wrong
You remember it wrong

[Chorus]
If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number
You got the wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number
You got the wrong number

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If you want me 'cause you heard somebody mention my name
And you wanna know if we can act like nothing has changed
Wrong number (You got the, you know that you got the)
Wrong number
If you're callin' because I happen to dance in your mind
And you wanna feel the way I made you feel one more time
Wrong number (You got the, you got the, you got the)
You got the wrong number

[Verse 1]
I know He got His hands on this
I know we got a chance on this
No, I never planned on this
I might need a band on this
This might get banned off rip
Gon' say somethin' 'fore y'all quit
Let me know something, who y'all with?
Don't know nothing, I know this
I know the Father breathed on this
Someone like we on this
Some might disagree on this
But I know somethin’, He gon’ listen
All yo problems, He know it
Ain’t no problem He don’t get
God gon’ solve em, He gon’ fix
Just wait on em, please don’t quit

[Chorus]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Verse 2]
More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God the Father like Maury
Don’t care what you say, nothin’ on me
I don’t care ‘bout the lawyer fees
I don’t care ‘bout your loyalties
God will solve it all for me
Trust man, he will fail ya’
Trust, and God’ll heal ya’
Dustin, he a Hoffman
Don’t fall what they offerin’, uh
Fall far too often, yeah, call God but don’t call enough
Fall down but don’t fall in love, I know God is all in us

[Chorus]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Outro]
There ain't nothin', He don't miss
Trust God, He don't miss
One God, He alone this
Amistad, we own this
Love of god, we own it

[Intro]
I want it to be, like, messy

[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
I'm over this teenage dream
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)

[Outro]
Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start
I am the way, the truth and life
No man cometh unto the Father but by me
If you're to enter into my kingdom
You must believe that I am what I am

I am the way, the truth and life
No man cometh unto the Father but by me
If you're to enter into my kingdom
You must believe that I am what I am

I am the way to salvation
The way to the great culmination
I am the way to bright glory
I am redemption's story

I am the bread of life
I am eternal life
I am the door by which you must enter
You must bеlieve that I am that I am

For I am, I am
I am, I am
I am the door by which you must еnter
You must believe that I am the I am
I am the light of the world
I am the everlasting father
I am the prince of peace
A wonderful counselor

I am the bread of life
I am eternal life
I am the way by which you must enter
You must believe that I am the I am

For I am, I am
I am, I am
I am the way by which you must enter
You must believe that I am
Just as I am, without one plea
But that thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, tho' tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fightings within and fears without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind
Sight, riches, healing of the mind
Yea, all I need in Thee to find
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believе
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Hath brokеn every barrier down;
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

[Chorus]
Mr. Chatterbox, how long will you live?
Always to receive but never to give
Always carry news all over the place
Mr. Chatterbox, you are a big disgrace

[Verse 1]
You cheek and you tongue a go let you down
And a when them let you down we a go batter you around
Bif, baf, boof, those are the blows you're gonna get

[Outro]

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know some shit that I would never say, never say
A lot of bad come with the good, I had to learn this shit come with the gain

I won't be the same, no I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't, no

On some real shit, shit still don't feel real shit
Now I'm in the hills countin' hunnid dollar bills with

And I got some stories that I'm taking to the grave with me
And I got some flowers I'ma take out to your grave with me
I was only young but seeing you go made a change in me
Taught me to trust nothing with a heart or with a brain in them

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know some shit that I would never say, never say
A lot of bad come with the good, I had to learn this shit come with the game
I thought money would change everything, everything

A lot of bad come with the good, I had to learn that shit come with the game
I thought money would change everything, everything
I can't rewrite the past, no money can buy my pain away
If anybody knows all I know
Seen too many rise just to fall
I won't be the same, no I won't
I won't, I won't, I won't, no

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Now, we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin’ by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I’ve been through, I wish I was dreaming
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus Lord)
I watched so many people leave, I see 'em change by the season
That's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin’ in
I know I madе a promise that I’d never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I’ve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain’t no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, "Look what I copped" (Lord)
Devil like, "Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped"
I don't say "What's up?", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no "I" in "Team", it's an "I" in "Win" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)

[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)
These **** ballin' they move, yeah, they gotta be playin', not the lottery (Lord)
I am in the flower, **** the pottery
Jargon is angelic, you don't get it, then pardon me
Got coke from Jesus, now I'm talkin' to Jesus (Jesus)
Real shallow ****, probably pray for a gray coupe (Lord)
Maybe the Lykan or a mansion out in the Seychelles
Ghost

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
And we done been a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Junya Watanabe on my wri', wri'
Junya Watanabe on my wri', wri'
Tell 'em this, did he miss?
Junya Watanabe on my, mmh
I can't really see, where did I miss? (Mmh, mmh)

Take what you want
Take everything

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Better that I change my number so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any product?
Well, that one time, I'll be honest
I'll be honest, we all liars, let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West with Marilyn Manson]
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

[Chorus: Kanye West with Marilyn Manson]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Don't you curse at mе on text, why you try to hit the flex?
I hold up, likе, "What?" I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting X'ed? Like, next
Guess who's getting X'ed?
You made a choice, that's your bad
Single life ain't so bad
But we ain't finna go there
Something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight
What a grand plan to sell you out
I could scream and shout, let it out

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
Man, tell them haters open up the jail (Open up the jail)
And you can tell my baby mamas get the bail money (Bail me)
I said one thing they ain't like, threw me out like they ain't care for me
Threw me out like I'm garbage, huh?
And that food that y'all took off my table
You know that feed my daughters, huh? (Mmm)
But I ain't really mad, 'cause when I look at it
I'm getting them snakes up out my grass and, ****, that's a good habit
I'm ready for war, let's get at 'em
And teaming up ain't gon' help 'em
'Cause beating the odds too deep
Just me and God, ****, ****, I'm good at it
Matter of fact, I'm great at it, my cell phone back at it
I know these people gon' try to tell me how to talk
Don't know what I seen or what I was taught
My mama worked two or three jobs to take care of three of her kids, my uncles watched
Yeah, we was raised by the crack addicts
Mmm, raised by the drug dealers, killers, and the junkies (Junkies)
Mama couldn't save us 'cause she had to get the—
Mama couldn't save us 'cause she had to get the money
Feel like your world falling, getting too hard to catch it, ain't it?
You and your girl arguin', you don't like how she actin' lately
Giving it everything that you can give and you don't get half the patience
You was busy hustlin', the things come with your hustle
They got in her head, corrupted her
Yeah, that's probably what happened, ain't it?
Large amount of capital, invested in myself
Underground, I ain't even have a basement, I read the affidavit
Let's see what it is with you
Only thing I did to you
Was always keep it real and true
Guilty, guess they gon' have to take me

[Chorus: Kanye West with Marilyn Manson]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Intro: Kanye West with Stalone]
Please welcome Dr. Donda West
Forever, ever
Can you hear me? Yeah
Forever, ever
Forever, forever, no
Glorious, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory

[Spoken Verse: Donda West, Kanye West, Kanye West & Stalone]
It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What do you want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different
My son (When you're runnin' outta time and you're not outta time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Change the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)

[Refrain: Kanye West with Stalone & Donda West]
Forever, yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, forever, no, oh, yeah
Glorious, glory, glory, glory
What did I teach him? (Glory)
And why Kanye ain't scared?

[Verse: Kanye West & Pusha T]
I'd rather deal with the shame than take the weight of the lie
Every time we talk I just wait for the lies
Every time I get the food, I just wait for the flies
Look, just send your prayers up, they'll be waitin' in the skies
My, my, my, Miss American Pie
Was a hero after Katrina but that levee went dry
Mom met my dad back in '75
Two years later, the chosen has arrived
Holy, Holy, Holy Father
Hold me in an ocean worth of Holy Water
And David's slingshot, hope it throws you farther
You brought church to stadiums built for only soccer
When the world built on lies, the truth is a threat
Faith over the fortune, it kept you outta debt
It's snakes in money pits that you ain't found yet
Crooks behind the scene like, "He ain't drown yet?"
Rain bills from the ranch 'til the whole town wet
God's grace rains down, that's the holy fountain
Got twelve thousand acres full of holy mountains
See, you almost didn't make it, who are you without Him?
Holy, Holy, Holy Father, hold me in a ocean the size of Holy Water
Man, if plan A worked, you wouldn't know your daughter
For every tear you cried in South Carolina

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)

[Verse 1]
I've been processed, packaged, delivered in bricks
I've been cut, cooked, chopped, and whipped
I've been called all types of names (heh)
Like perico, yeyo, snow, blow, and cane
I'm the reason that the Cubans took over Miami
I'm the reason they extorted Escobar by extraditing his family
I'm protected by killers
I'm handles by dealers
Well-connected with greed
I'm all white but I produce green
They'll kick in your door, like Bruce Lee
Just to have an intimate love affair with me
I corrupt governments. Yeah, that's me (ha ha ha)
I built the streets, listen closely
Now, it's cool to be a snitch, it's cool to go to jail
It's cool to get caught. Damn, where did I fail?
When I was in the streets heavy they had codes and rules
Now it's just steady foes and fools
That's why they get found stiff like frozen food
Take a sniff and let me remind you (Whoo!)

[Chorus]
Sniff (co-), snort, (-caine)
Deal (cow-), extort (-boys)
Will (will), kill (kill)
For the love of the blood sport
They'll do 25 to life
For the love of the blood sport

I see you look at me, like no one else is there
I don't know what I want, but I don't want love again
I never asked for this, I'm busy with my friends
Try to enjoy myself, before it all ends
One thing that I know is I don't need no one but myself
Oh, one thing that's for sure is I don't need you or anyone else

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm okay by myself
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Spoken Intro]
If we do it in … how about B flat?

[Verse 1]
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind
I can't wait, waitin' just makin' me go blind
Did you ever lay awake at night, your face turned to the wall
Drowning in your thoughtlessness, and cut off from it all?
I don't know, maybe for you it's not that late
But as for me, don't know how much longer I can wait

[Verse 2]
It's got to end, everything about it just feels wrong
I pretend, being close to her is where I don't belong
Well, my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
I'll stay here, where I can feel the hand of fate
And I don't know, how much longer I can wait

[Verse 3]
Skies are grey, life is short, and I think of her a lot
I can't say if I want the pain to end or not
Well, the blindness overtaking me is beating like a drum
I don't know where it starts or where it's comin' from
That's how it is, when I try to concentrate
And I don't know, how much longer I can wait

[Bridge]
I've been drinkin'
Drinkin' forbidden juices
I've been livin'
Livin' on lame excuses

[Verse 4]
My hands are cold, the end of time has just begun
I'm gettin' old, anything can happen now to anyone
I walk across the floor 'til I wear out my shoes

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Calboy]
...And darlin', I was raised in that field, I’m a soldier
Gotta keep it solid, I'ma fight until it's over
I live from a place where you just gotta keep a toaster
I jumped off the porch and I been runnin’ like a motor, yeah, yeah
You might understand but you won't ever feel me (Never feel me)
Oh Lord, give me a chance to see the man I will be (Man I will be)
Only ridin' with this can 'cause demons tryna kill me
Maybe you can send a sign or somethin' so I can feel free
I done made some choices that was not the real me
Heard so many brokеn promises, like "Mhm, we'll see"
Vivid picturеs, runnin' through my thoughts, I still see
Granny say, "Go get some lovin' ’round your heart, it will freeze"
Even though you broke my heart, I still wish you well
Next stage must be Heaven ’cause I been through hell
Back against the wall, still, I prevail
I got war scars, darlin', can’t you tell? (Can't you tell?)

[Verse 2: Calboy]
They got me thinkin' 'bout my past like
I done been to hell and back, remember like it was last night
Sorry Lord, ain’t tryna hurt nobody, tryna get my bag right
Fightin' anxiety and depression, that was every night
Say she got me, yeah, right
Say he got me, yeah, right
'Member they called me crazy 'cause I pray up to the damn sky
I just met this dude, have a tribulation with my head high
I talk to God like everyday, I hope the dead fly
'Cause where I'm from, you never make it out
Without a smile, I'd lose but I'm not breakin' down
Still got that wild in me but I'd fixate for Ralph's
Oh, she can vibe with me? Then I might stay a while
Look how far I've come, think I should take a bow
My heart was honin' you, now is you should make it out
I was the world for you, you let 'em lay 'em down
I was for you for you, you let 'em take me out

[Outro: Calboy]
Take me out, take me out, take me out
Take me out

[Verse]
Somewhere in a lot
Out in Laramie I thought myself
In a knot, again
Tangled up from looking in
And I wish I had the mind
To make a place where you and I
Didn’t have to try
It’s a heavy super love
And I thought of you a lot
At some rest stop parking lot in Colorado
I’m lost again
Drifting out and drifting in
And you were right!
You shouldn’t have to try
For something simple as a smile, oh god
When I’m low, I aim high, oh god
It’s a heavy super love

[Outro]
In a Utah hotel I drank myself out
Touched myself and passed out
I tried to FaceTime, I miss you right now
Then white man looks in my face and looks down
Like, “What are you doing in this town, huh?”
I ash a cigarette and look down, I miss you!
Then strange lights hover ahead and touch down, duck down!
One two three one two
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
It's too hard to sing
That if I ran away 

[?]

John:...when I start going oh oh about eight times
Paul: I just won't sing that bit
John: One two three

[Verse 1]
She wanted no part
Oblivious of luck
Shame or conceit
While proud men allied
Glorious worms
Her redshifted cheeks imbued with life

[Chorus]
“Black Hole Era doesn’t concern me”
Then she said: “Black Hole Era doesn’t concern me”

[Verse 2]
Duty bell spread its tone up
And through the box spring
While anxious men
Stacked empties and letters
Downstairs, in a dresser

[Verse 3]
And all things around
Kept losing their bonds
Erasing from earth
Words, meaning and life
Lost futures in her еyes

[Chorus]
“Black Hole Era doesn’t concеrn me”
Then she said: “Black Hole Era doesn’t concern me”

[Verse 1]
Dreaming of enhanced feelings
Words with no loss of meaning
Known limits shall give away
Fresh apples that won’t decay
Breathing craft and will

[Verse 2]
Sun pursues eternal extols
Rotating spheres, shifting poles
Deposed kings and queens
Against new competing machines
Standing marveled… in awe

[Chorus]
Massive tides carefully smooth domains
Nature reveals itself to mankind again
Cirrhosis removed from patient men
Who dare… come back flesh and bone
To reclaim the world as their own

[Verse 1]
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday, could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if She saw us

[Pre-Chorus]
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

[Chorus]
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
I wanna make you yell (Yell)
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
Don't wanna treat you well (Well)

[Verse 2]
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving

[Pre-Chorus]
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

[Chorus]
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
(Bad things)
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad (things to you)
Don't wanna treat you well

[Intro]
Welcome, it's Billie, and this is Happier Than Ever, the first time I am doing my album all in one back to back, so, I'm Billie

[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

[Verse 2]
Last week, I rеalized I crave pity
When I rеtell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

[Verse 3]
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

[Outro]
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time

[Intro]
Okay
Mm-mm, I

[Verse 1]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed

[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

[Verse 2]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyes)
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of - nerve
I don't deserve, so

[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew, ha
Said you were bad news

[Outro: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-a
La-da-da-da-da-da
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to focus
And you don’t seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection’s all alone
I had to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I (I), I’m in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

[Verse 2]
I know supposedly I’m lonely now (Lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (Someone)
But aren’t I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)
’Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again

[Chorus]
But I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her (Ooh)
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information’s not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there’s somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it’s torture though
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (You sure do)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m not sentimental
But there's somethin’ 'bout the way you look tonight, mm ('Bout the way you look tonight)
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I’m the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)

[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)
That heavy breathin' on the floor (On the floor)
I'm yours, I'm yours (I'm yours)

[Outro]
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental

[Intro: Los Angeles Children's Chorus]
"He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart"
"On thee we gaze, O' gold-wing'd messenger of mighty Gods"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Gold-winged angel
Go home, don't tell
Anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart

[Chorus]
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down

[Verse 2]
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year

[Chorus]
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down-down-down-down-down

[Instrumental break]

[Outro: Los Angeles Children's Chorus]
"With yearning heart"
"On thee we gaze, O' gold-wing'd messenger of mighty Gods"

[Intro]
Something's in the—

[Verse 1]
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (You, you)
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your s*** together, but damn, I was wrong (Wrong)

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job (Job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

[Verse 2]
I used to think you were shy (Shy)
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (Mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(So) So easy (So, so)
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong (Wrong)

[Chorus]
You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Yeah)
But you got no job (No job)
You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Think you're such a lost cause)
But you got no job

[Outro]
(What did I tell you?)
(Don't get complacent)
(It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na)
(What did I tell you?)
(Don't get complacent)
(It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na)

[Verse 1]
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few

[Verse 2]
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you

[Verse 3]
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 4]
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
What am I to do?

[Spoken]
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?

[Verse 1]
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really), how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
No reaction

[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated

[Verse 2]
I don't really wanna know why it went there (Why it went there)
I kinda don't care (Kinda don't care)
You wanna kill me? (You wanna kill me?)
You wanna hurt me? (Mmm)
Stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
(Is it news? News to who?)
That I really look just like the rest of you

[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated

[Bridge]
And everybody said it was a letdown
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
(Am I?) Am I?
All these other inanimate -, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?

[Chorus]
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated

[Verse 1]
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone

[Verse 2]
"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?

[Verse 4]
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown

[Intro]
Mmm
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

[Verse 1]
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

[Verse 2]
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

[Verse 1]
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' s*** to say, oh-oh

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here (I think I hate it here)
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

[Outro]
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 1]
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

[Pre-Chorus]
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Verse 2]
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

[Bridge]
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name

[Chorus]
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
I think, therefore, I am (I am)
I'm not your friend (Friend)
Or anything, damn (They wanna)
You think that you're the man (You're the man)
I think, therefore, I am (Therefore, I am)

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I’m happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin’ you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I’m away from you (When I’m away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn’t true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
’Cause you only listen to your f***** friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this s*****
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk s*** about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that s***'s embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me f*****' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just f****** leave me alone, yeah (F*** you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(F*** you)
(F*** you)

[Verse 1]
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with -
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Interlude]
(Want me to sing in here?)
(Okay)

[Verse 2]
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Outro]
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you

[Verse 1]
I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong
I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry and washed my clothes down
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away, he was not ordinary
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
I said, "I got no money, man," he said "That ain't necessary"

[Verse 2]
We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket and he gavе me his word
I said, 'Where wе going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth
I said, "That’s the best news that I've ever heard"
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold
I was thinking 'bout diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she saw I was so reckless
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could just hang on and be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said

[Verse 3]
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said, "There's a body that I'm trying to find"
"If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price”
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind
Well, the wind, it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to get on

[Verse 4]
Picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her
She was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special"
She said, "You look different," I said, "Well, I guess"
She said, "You been gone," I said, "That's only natural"
She said, "You going to stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes"

[Verse 5]
Isis, oh, Isis, you a mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
She was lying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on his shoes
Heading out for the Old East Coast
Lord knows he's paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam, I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out West
Splitting up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walkin' away
Sayin' over her shoulder
"We'll meet on another day, on the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 3]
He had a job in Santa Fe
Workin' in an old hotel
But he never did like it all that much
And one day it just went to Hell
So he drifted down to New Orleans
Lucky enough to be destroyed
Well he got him a job on a fishing boat
Docked right outside of Delacroix
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind
And he just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, right beside my chair
Said "Don't tell me, lemme guess your name"
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
Must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started in the dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
So now I'm going on back again
I got to get to them somehow
All the faces we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are truck drivers' wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Ever look at all the people, seem to know exactly how to be? (How to be, how to be now, how to be)
You think they don't need piles of prescriptions to function naturally? (Functioning natural)
Take a look and you might just catch it, stay a minute more (Minute more, minute more now, minute more)
There's a little moment after the sunny smile that eyes fall to the floor (To the floor, to the floor now, to the floor)

[Pre-Chorus]
And then truth starts peeking through (Peeking through)
They don't lie like me and you
They can fake a smile too

[Chorus]
Thе anonymous ones never lеt you see the hate they carry (They carry, they carry, they carry)
All those anonymous ones never name the quiet pain they bury (They bury, they bury, they bury)
Keep on keeping secrets that they think they have to hide
What if everybody's secret is they have that secret side?
And to know, to know we're not alone is all we're hoping for
I don't wanna be anonymous
I ain't gotta be anonymous
I don't wanna be anonymous anymore (Anymore)

[Verse 2]
Spot the girl who stays in motion, spins so fast so she won't fall (World's spinning so fast, spinning so fast)
She's built a wall of her achievements to keep out the question, without it is she worth anything at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth starts peeking through
They don't lie like me and you
They can fake a smile too

[Chorus]
The anonymous ones never let you see the hate they carry (They carry, they carry, they carry)
All those anonymous ones never name the quiet pain they bury (They bury, they bury, they bury)
I don't wanna be anonymous
I ain't gotta be anonymous
I don't wanna be anonymous anymore

[Bridge]
The parts we can't tell, we carry them well, but that doesn't mean they're not heavy
The parts we can't tell, we carry them well, but that doesn't mean they're not heavy (I don't wanna be anonymous anymore)
The parts we can't tell, we carry them well, but that doesn't mean they're not heavy, heavy

[Chorus]
Anonymous ones never let you see the hate they carry (They carry, they carry, they carry)
All the anonymous ones never name the quiet pain they bury
Keep on keeping secrets that they think they have to hide
What if everybody's secret is they have that secret side?
And to know, to know we're not alone is all we're hoping for
I don't wanna be anonymous
I ain't gotta be anonymous
I don't wanna be anonymous anymore

[Verse 1]
I can't read ya, my sexy Mona Lisa
Can't tell if you gon' leave here, or if you wanna stay
Girl, just ease up, don't yell in my two-seater
You say that you a freaker, but fall asleep at eight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sheesh (Sheesh), but you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama, mama
Sheesh (Sheesh), girl, you killin' me
But you won't see me with another lover

[Chorus]
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco, I'm just ridin' the wave
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo, but I love you that way

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
There's something 'bout a crazy lover
Oh
I love you that way

[Verse 2]
Damn, that body, devil in Versace
Did I win the lottery or am I gonna pay?
Damn, you got me, likе bitcoin and like Doge
I'm rich with you besidе me, 'cause you're not coin-based

[Pre-Chorus]
Sheesh (Sheesh), but you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama, mama
Sheesh (Sheesh), girl, you killin' me
But you won't see me with another lover

[Chorus]
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco, I'm just ridin' the wave
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo, but I love you that way, yeah

[Outro]
Sheesh, girl, you perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feelin’ sad and kind of blue
I didn’t know what in the world I was gonna do
Them Communists they was comin’ around
They were in the air
They were on the ground
They were all over

[Verse 2]
So I ran down most hurriedly
And joined the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
Went back to my backyard
And started lookin' on the sidewalk
'Neath the rose bush

[Verse 3]
Well, I was lookin’ everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the mornin’ ’n’ lookеd under my bed
Looked bеhind my kitchen, behind the door
Even tore loose the kitchen floor
I couldn’t find any

[Verse 4]
I looked beneath the sofa, beneath the chair
Lookin' form them Reds everywhere
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away

[Verse 5]
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor
I snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss
Sayin' "Hands up, you Communist!"
It was the mailman
He punched me out

[Verse 6]
Well, I quit my job so I could work alone
I got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered there was red stripes on the American flag
Did you know about Betsy Ross?

[Verse 7]
Well, I was sittin’ home alone an’ I started to sweat
I figured they was in my television set
I peeked behind the picture frame
And got a shock from my feet that hit my brain
Them Reds did it
The ones on the "Hootenanny"

[Verse 8]
Well, I fin’ly started thinkin’ straight
When I run outa things to investigate
I couldn’t imagine doin’ anything else
So now I’m sittin’ home investigatin’ myself
Hope I don’t find out too much, good God

[Verse 1: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

[Verse 2: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah, the country was young
With God on its side

[Verse 3: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to mеmorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their sidе

[Verse 4: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
The First World War boys
It closed out its fate
The reason for fightin'
I never got straight
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side

[Verse 5: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

[Verse 6: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

[Verse 7: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side

[Verse 8: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for you
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

[Verse 9: Bob Dylan & Joan Baez]
So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
That if God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war

Light the incense (Incense), not to mention (Mention)
Skin like whiskey (Whiskey)
She's cold like on the rocks (Rocks)
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la
Eyes still low, smokin' zaza

Feelings get lost in the lala (Here we go, haha, we in business)

Happy but you're unhappy (We in business)
Shorty, you're so valid

Don't you know eyes can be so deadly?
I try not to think, but you made me
It's just a G thing, baby (Baby)
Now all in my satin sheets, you're layin' (Layin')
Walk through the door, there you were
Bought you Louis, Fendi, et cetera
Woman, you should've told me you were dangerous
Woman, you should've told me you were medicine (Here we go)

[Intro: Kanye West with Stalone]
See this in 3D
Slow life down for me
Slow life down for me
Thought and thoughts to me
80 Degrees
Warming up to me
Finally free
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I won't sh-ow
I might float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry nigga from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's only defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me
But they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call
I might not get the message
She just tried to run off with my heart
But I blocked off the exit, yeah

[Bridge: KayCyy]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I know you won't (And I know)
I know you won't, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know you won't
I know that you look over us
So we sleep sound asleep
Rain down rain (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
A lot of people off the self
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
A lot of people are for sale, pull up like
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
A lot of people run and tell
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Time ought to tell, judge black males
Gon' cross all the rails to stop clientele
Let me take you round, round, round
This a new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten
We going in, in, in
No doubt Kan' can't cool it
Good job for a student
Nice car for a student
Nice shoes for a student
New bag going stupid
Show me how you do it
Show me how you -err
Don Kan', who you foolin'?
I don't wanna be so judgemental
I don't wanna be so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
(Everybody judge)
Flying down with the next invention
Got the new Porsche up with the Tesla engine, -err
They keep playin' one bit
Texts coming in fast
That's a A1 kit
That's a A1 split
Travel ban, cancel trips
But the crime rate, take a pic
Let me show you what he did
Change the summer for the kid
Hundred summers for the kid
Throw a line, what he did
Throw a line, what he did in the

[Outro: Kanye West]
City of lost angels, uh, uh, uh
City of lost angels, uh, uh, uh
City of lost angels
City of lost angels, uh, uh, uh

[Part I]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah
Kept the Galleria open 'til ten for you and your friends
You know how I spend in H-O-U-S-T-O-N
I get too crazy, had a little baddina
We stay good friends, we get too wavy
All I know is that when this cup ends, the next one begins
My bae, you know me and you knew me back then
And you know how it goes when I see you again
You know I'm making my way to your ends
And you know I need you to be there for me

[Verse 2: Drake]
You a little Post Oak baby
You a little forty-eight baby
Got a little candy in her pocket
She gon' take off like a—
You already know (Know, know, know, know)
Dirtied up a cup, I'm on the Northside
Text you but I know you probably courtside
No, I got to come and check the whole man, baby, hold tight
I just touched the city with the G-block stainers
And we got it adopted by some fifth ward strangers
You know what it means when I twist these fingers
Me and you been on a first name basis
Why you think I hate it when you talk that Drake shit?
Same reason that you never left me hangin'
Same reason that I tried to make you famous
Same reason that I tried to show you just who I was

[Chorus: Drake]
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club
Show you just who I was
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club

[Interlude]
Some OVO shit, let's go— have some fun, enjoy the show
You know, we in Houston celebrating
We goin' to Houston, Atlanta, Vegas
Y'all are going to Vegas? Now we in Houston
We definitely goin' down
Goddamn it—

[Part II]

[Chorus: Drake]
Pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Yeah, pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Now I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep, oh
In too deep, in too deep, oh
In too deep, in too deep, oh
I'm in too deep, oh, in too deep

[Verse: Future]
Got some bad bitches
That's gon' fuck me for that AP
Fuck me for that AP, fuck me for that AP
If I wasn't rappin', baby, I would still be trappin', baby
Comin' down on sippin' techs, boppers on me, hella crazy
New Mercedes for my baby, 2022, updated
Shorty met a sponsor in the club
Shock's spend a hundred like dubs
I'm lovin' droppin' bands on her
Emilio Pucci curvin' her up
We turn the studio into a strip club
Got the strippers goin' way up
Drankin' on Texas and I pop two pills
That's gon' make a nigga stay up
In too, in too deep (Pop them freaks)
Bitch on demon time, she don't get sleep
You get She Nay Nay, number five five, one, two, three, woah

[Chorus: Drake]
Pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Yeah, pop that shit, pop that shit
Baby, that pussy was so worth the wait
I wasn't in love with none of them anyway
Now I'm in too deep, I'm in too deep, oh
In too deep, in too deep, oh
In too deep, in too deep, oh
I'm in too deep, oh, in too deep

[Intro]
Damn, these niggas broke as a motherfucka, bro, what the fuck goin' on, bro?
I'm not on enough, gettin' money 'round, this motherfucka wet
What you lookin' at, nigga? Head shot, face shot

[Chorus]
Uh, uh, bust down everything
Two chains on me, nigga, I let it bang
I ain't check the shit, I'm walkin' the door, strap, must not know my name
Two pistols on my hip like I'm Max Payne
On the save, VVS my chain, I'm SOD Money Gang
Bust down Cartier came from Johnny Dang
Air out on the freeway, double R, nigga, it not a thang
Two thousand cash for these buffets, dark frames like Johnny Cage

[Verse 1]
Hunnid fifty thou' cash in the save, fuckin' America Express
Head shot, face shot, gang nigga reachin' for my nеck
It's a water, water wet, Audеmars Piguet and a new Patek
I jumped off the porch and I jumped on a jet
Jump, jump, jumped on a jet
Uh, uh, niggas mad, get here with the TEC
Uh, seven-six-two, two-two-three, bullets hit the hardest
On this private jet, big Boeing, I went to the forest
Bust down, bust down, bust down my Rollie
Double R, double R, he actin' like he know me
Big stick on me, air knock down your big homie
F&N on the backseat, who gon' pick on me?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm a dumb mind
Nigga get DP, jump like the lunch line
Bling, bling, blaow, lookin' at the water on my neck like wow
F&N spray the crowd, nigga, on gang

[Chorus]
Uh, uh, bust down everything
Two chains on me, nigga, I let it bang
I ain't check the shit, I'm walkin' the door, strap, must not know my name
Two pistols on my hip like I'm Max Payne
On the save, VVS my chain, I'm SOD, Money Gang
Bust down Cartier came from Johnny Dang
Air out on the freeway, double R, nigga, it not a thang
Two thousand cash for these buffets, dark frames like Johnny Cage

[Verse 2]
Bust down, bust down, VVS on my teeth, nigga (Bust down)
Buy a new chain every week, nigga
SOD the gang, I fell in love with beef, nigga
Murder gang, money gang, I hang with some street niggas
Seven-six-two, bullets knock down the street, nigga
Fifty thousand for my feet, nigga, I gotta eat, nigga
Homie, twenty-five thousand on CashApp every week, nigga
Have to get money, it's out, sixteen, how the fuck you mad at me, nigga?
On the set, nigga, whatever you did, I been did that
Big, big choppa blow his whole wet bag
Big, big Backwood, I smoke for a week, nigga
Three point five, we was smokin' on back fourteen, nigga, on gang
Big ice gang, big ice chain
Two pistols on me, I spray the whole gang
Messin' with the squad, nigga, you must be insane
I done bust down the Cartier and I'ma bust down my frames, nigga, on my gang

[Outro]
On my set (Soulja)
Niggas bitch
What's wrong with y'all niggas, nigga?
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on, make the room move (Prr), gon' doubt it

[Verse]
Endlessly I've dreamed of love and its fever
And how it could bring such a change through the years
Now that it's all real, nowhere to run
We must make the best of the things that we've done

Sittin' 'round thinkin' 'bout it rips my soul
It drives me to the bitter end, you know
Glad that it's over and love didn't last
I'll think of the future, the heck with the past

[Chorus]
And the words don't come from the heart of me, girl
We can't go on make believin'
We're still in love, can't you see
It's meant to be

[Verse]
Love was a sweet dream - I woke, it was gone
And then came the bad times, on and on
If that's how it must be, I don't feel so bad
And I'll count your love as the worst that I've had

[Chorus]
And the words don't come from the heart of me, girl
We can't go on make believin'
We're still in love, can't you see
It's meant to be

[Verse]
Sweet and bitter ways are not often wrong
When one's for another it can't be done
I followed a dream and it took me away
Away from love's fever we caught yesterday

[Chorus]
And the words don't come from the heart of me, girl
We can't go on make believin'
We're still in love, can't you see
It's meant to be

[Chorus - Outro]
And the words don't come from the heart of me, girl
We can't go on make believin'
And the words don't come from the heart of me, girl
We can't go on make believin'

[Chorus: Kanye West & Victory]

...time's off...

[Kanye West]
...won't slow down my breath...

[Verse 1]
Come around you roving’ gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 2]
He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever therе was people, therе was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 3]
Sailing’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They’re still talking’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
“I’ve come to win some money,” Gambling Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 4]
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 5]
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 6]
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 7]
It was late one evening’ during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 8]
So all you roving’ gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gambling days are up
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 1]
Well I'll sing you a song, It ain't very long
About an old man, who never done wrong
How he died nobody can say
They found him dead in the street one day

[Verse 2]
Well, the crowd they gathered one fine morn
At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
There on the sidewalk he did lay
They stopped 'n' stared 'n' walked their way

[Verse 3]
Well, the policeman come and he looked around
"Get up, old man, or I'm a-takin' you down"
He jabbеd him once with his billy club
And the old man then rollеd off the curb

[Verse 4]
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said
"Call the wagon, this man is dead"
The wagon come, they loaded him in
I never saw the man again

[Verse 5]
Well, I've sung you my song, it ain't very long
About an old man who never done wrong
How he died no one can say
They found him dead in the street one day

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 2]
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
And how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 3]
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
And how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Intro]
It feels so good to be alive
Got all my family by my side
Couldn't wipe this black off if I tried
That's why I lift my head with pride

[Verse 1]
I got a million miles on me
They want to see how far I'll go
The path was never paved with gold (Gold)
We worked and built this on our own (Own)

[Pre-Chorus]
And can't nobody knock it if they tried
This is hustle personified
Look how we've been fighting to stay alive
So when we win, we will have pride
Do you know how much we have cried?
How hard we had to fight?

[Chorus]
It feels so good to be alive (It feels so, so, so, so good)
Got all my sisters by my side (I got all my sisters by my side)
Couldn't wipe this black off if I tried (Black off if I tried)
That's why I lift my hеad with pride
Now we're sitting on top of thе world again, huh

[Verse 2]
I got a million miles on me
They want to see how far I'll go (They want to see how far I'll go)
The path was never paved with gold (No)
We fought and built this on our own (We fought and built this on our own, own)

[Pre-Chorus]
And can't nobody knock it if they tried
This is hustle personified
Look how we've been fighting to stay alive
So when we win, we will have pride
Do you know how much we have cried?
How hard we had to fight?

[Chorus]
It feels so good to be alive (It feels so good, so good)
Got all my family by my side (And we gon' sit on top of the world again)
Couldn’t wipe this black off if I tried (And I wouldn't trade nothin', and I wouldn't trade nothin')
That's why I lift my head with pride (So baby, lift your head, yeah)
It feels so good to be alive (Darling, it's a celebration for you, yeah)
I got the tribe all by my side (You're doin' everything they said you couldn't do)
Couldn’t wipe this black off if I tried
That's why I lift my head with pride (Lift your head, yeah)

[Outro]
Woo!
(Ooh)
(Ooh, I tried)
(Oh!)

[Intro]
Yeah (Huh)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap
People recognize me from the TV, but I'm done with that
People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's me that's gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back
All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
Or times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I mean, even with his salary, you can't put no prices on that
There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real
I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix
Actually, I never wanna know 'cause we made it like this
Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss
Overtime hours all good, we take it in shifts
What would you do if it wasn't this? That's a hard one
The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from
Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from
Anxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done
Delusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from
My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from
Bet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from
I know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from
But I still don't know where I get the calm from
(Where I get the calm from) Yeah

[Interlude]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah (Woah, woah)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)
My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with
I'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off
Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the strings'll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that
Y'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back
And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard
Oh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it
I'm always tryna rekindle
From the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning
Nobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)

[Outro]
Woah, woah, woah-woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah-woah, woah
Woah, woah, ah
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Yeah (Ooh, yeah)
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Hard when it starts to fade away
It's hard when the memories start to fade away
Said its hard when the memories start to fade away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh) So beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me
And I'm coming back better for you (I'm comin' back, oh-ooh)
Most times it was my selfishness and your helplessness that I took advantage of
You sit in the house and I be out and I know you're worried, up (I know you're worried, you're worried, you're worried)
And you try and block it out
I'm so sorry for letting you down (Oh-oh, oh-ah)

[Refrain: Drake]
I should've came home, came home sooner
You'd probably still be there if I
Came home, love you like I treat ya
You'd still be there
My girl, my lil' baby speechless
You'd still be there, baby

[Verse 2: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me (Work it)
And I'm coming back with a plan and there's money in my hand, baby (Work it)
You said I was fucking up when I was out here fucking fans, damn, and it made you look crazy
Made you seem, made you feel, it was crazy (Ooh-ah)
While you sit in the house, I be out and you stay worried about me (Oh)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Nights when I just needed to hold somebody
Feeling overwhelmed, should've told somebody
Picturin' it's me sending chills through your body
I just probably should've chilled 'til I saw you
How am I supposed to get to know somebody?
Nigga left his 20s and I still wanna party
I can not be trusted on my own with nobody
I can not be
If we broke it off then you know it wasn't painless
If she got a watch then you know it's not a stainless
I was out here fucking fans, I was shameless
Yeah, and I know that
You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you
Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do
Hard for me to justify the women I was into
Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you
Then I locked the door that night in Vegas 'cause I had to
Then I had a kid even though I never planned to
I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news
I know that
Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything
Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything
Probably made you want to kill me on everything
Yeah, trust, I know that (Trust, I know)
Dialing, I'ma say two, zero, one, four
'Cause you're on the same shit that you was on before
I know you're not happy, girl, everybody know
Could see it in your boyfriend eyes at the show
Don't tell me let it go, I'm a letting go pro
You don't wanna grow but we gotta outgrow
Went six digits on the lock screen code
You crack  into that ho and it's gon' be a lot of smoke
We both getting rich but the trust getting broke
Tear me down with words but I know that's how you cope
Cover up a lot, can't cover up your soul
Know you're not happy, girl, everybody know

[Outro: Drake]
(Trust, I know that, trust, I know)

[Intro]
M-M—, M-M—

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
No, I'm never gangbangin' in my blue Chucks
Money callin' so I threw the deuce up
Yeah, they plottin' on me but they gotta do somethin'
Told my dawg two-somethin' just to shoot somethin' (M-M—)
Left them niggas stretched out on the train tracks
Rather you than me, here come that payback
Got 'em lookin' for that paper that they can't tax
Yayo so clean, I told 'em call it, "Ajax"
Hialeah celebrated when Fidel died
Patti LaBelle, who knew that we would sell pies?
Standin' on your own is when you realize
When all the lights go out, that's when you see the real guys
Back to the real niggas glowin' in the dark (M-M—)
Never perfect but you know a nigga heart
A rich nigga that'll pull up to the park
Get on one knee and tell the kids that they are stars
Bullet wounds don't be covered by ObamaCare
Your funeral was way too soon, that's if your mama there
Real niggas deserve to live twice (M-M—)
Plastic fork and some fried rice

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, two-point-two for the Rafael Nadal
Don't act like you're happy for me now
Don't act like you wasn't prayin' for catastrophic collapses
Catalog is immaculate
Still runnin' the game, don't ask me about the practice
Ho, you go on vacation, don't ask me about relaxin'
Not sure if you know but I'm actually Michael Jackson
The man I see in the mirror is actually goin' platinum
Unthinkable when I think of the way these niggas been actin'
Yeah, I never did you nothin' and you play like we family, huh?
Next thing, you wanna shoot me down, it can't be love
Not sure where you was tryna send it, it can't be up
That day you sounded like a bitch, you fancy, huh?
Damn, how can I forgive like this?
I gotta dead a lot of shit just to live like this
I had to fuck a lot of girls to get a kid like this
I had to get a lot of cribs to get a crib like this, nigga
That's why I'm movin' all elusive
These boys on they last resort and it's givin' us all inclusive
Been spazzin' since CB was chunkin' up the deuces, nigga
Your shit was boo-boo, excuses, excuses, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Brrrt, may I speak to pussy niggas?
I just call it like I see it, I ain't even lookin', nigga
I just walk it like I speak and I ain't speakin' to them niggas
I ain't starvin', I'm just greedy, all I eat is pussy niggas
Don't wan' see these pussy niggas, y'all can't see me, pussy niggas
You keep talkin' like you eatin', I'ma feed you bullets, nigga
I might even cook a nigga, all my weed is cookies, nigga
Shove a 8-ball up her pussy like a fetus for me, nigga
I got bitches doin' lines, I'm Adidas to 'em, nigga
I got sentenced, took some time and it was easier than simple
I'm so difficult to fathom like a fever in the winter
I got women in the Phantom with they cleavage out the window
Long hair, lot of tats and I smell like the pack
Money trail right on track
Whip that big body Maybach like it's a little Pontiac
All my chains look like snakes, that's some real diamondbacks
Pull my hammer out her pussy, pull her nails out my back
I don't chill, I react
On the scale, my pockets fat, and to this whale, you like a ant
I'm a dog, if you a dog, then pull your tail up out your ass
And on this Codeine, I'm a turtle, it done shell-shocked my ass
I'm the hottest on the cellblock, I promise
I can fly to check my mailbox, invoices soundin' like Jill Scott
Pill popped, house in Hidden Hills on the hilltop
Her ears popped, she lick my lollipop and my teardrops, Tunechi

[Intro: Drake]
Uh
This might be too real, too real

[Verse 1: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, supposed to be mine
Baby
I need some help just like anyone else
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, open your eyes
Baby
You said you felt something for me (Talk to 'em)
I don't know when
Based on the signals you send
Based on the way you apologized
When you came to see me and then (Then what?)
You had the nеrve to defend (Dеfend what?)
Mistakes that you made at the end
You said I was too invested
And that's what had forced you to go and pretend
I swear you crazy
Someone that's close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends (Oh)

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend (Woo)
And it's wrong, I know (Know, know, know)
But again (Ooh, yeah)
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend (Oh)
And it's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
No
You said you felt, you said you felt
Something that's different from everyone else
You had the nerve to still ask for my help
Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
You said you fell
And I took your word that night in our hotel
One thing about time, surely, time's gonna tell
Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
Can't let it go, can't get this out of me
This shit still bothers me
Don't you dare (Don't you dare)
Don't say you're proud of me
Hurt's just unreal to me
Now you wanna come crack to me (Crack, crack)
Three whole years after me
Why did you wait 'til the end?

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend, friend
And it don't feel wrong, but again
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend
Oh, and it's wrong, I know, but again
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend

[Intro]
Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look

[Verse]
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, "True, though"
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call "R.I.P. Nipsey"
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a "Respectfully," I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' "Bro," but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, "Boy, you're going places"
Never understood where I could really take it

[Outro]
Yeah

[Intro]
No friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man, you niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (Woah)
Yeah, you heard about me, you don't know me more than that
Yeah I know I—
Hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus]
No friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man, you niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (Woah)
I was known for snappin' when I chat before the app
Stood on everything I said and never took it back (Woah)
No friends in the industry
I had to draw the line between my brothers and my enemies, a fact
Niggas love to start the beef, don't wanna keep it rap
Yeah, he hit us up and now we owe you something back

[Verse 1]
See, I was young angel but these niggas turned me evil
Yeah, I know I know you, but you really ain't my people
Yeah, I heard some people say they know 'em as my equal
Truth be told, I son these niggas, girl, I don't compete with 'em
Ask about The Boy and they gon' say they got the streets with him
Niggas so offensive knowin' they don't have no defense
Why they always act like we can fix it with a meeting?
All that linking up, man, I'ma see ya when I see ya
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, brothers been my brothers, man
You niggas ain't no kin and that's a fact (Ayy)
And I'm like Sha'Carri, smoke 'em on and off the track (Aye)
And you love that hoe, but me, I put her on her back
You get Drizzy on a track, he'll put you on the map
Oh, it's like that? Hell yeah it's like that (Ayy)
And I got a contract, it's a max (Ayy)
SInce I got in contact, she attached
When I signed my first deal, that shit came through a fax
That should let you know how long I been out here runnin' laps
(I been doin' this for a long time)

[Chorus]
Yeah, no friends in the industry
My brothers been my brothers, man, you niggas ain't no kin to me, a fact (Woah)
I was known for snappin' when I chat before the app
Stood on everything I said and never took it back (Woah)
No friends in the industry
I had to draw the line between my brothers and my enemies, a fact
Niggas love to start the beef, don't wanna keep it rap
Yeah, he hit us up and now we owe you something back

[Verse 2]
(Ayy, what?)
Damn, this shit too dirty, gotta yellow tape it
And I got her waitin' at the telly naked
We ain't drop though, how you niggas celebratin'?
Already disrespecting, something I ain't tolerating
You niggas fuck with me, I give 'em motivation
And your circle shrinkin', see some boys escapin'
Rest of them is guilty by association (Ayy, what?)
Fuck debatin' who the goat
Bet not make the shit up 'bout the numbers all I know
Bet not make the shit up 'bout the summer all I know
Better find ya someone else to hit with all that smoke, nigga, yeah
And all them tweets and all them posts
Ain't got the type of time to be playin' with you folk
I had a Richard prior to these niggas, that's the joke
I'm really down to die behind these verses in my notes

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, brothers with my brothers, man, you niggas ain't no kin and that's a—
(I could play off the iPod?
Yeah 'cause this a mother fuckin' 2016, baby
I see the way the lights go, on the dashboard
The lights go to the dashboard
That's how you know it's new, ooh)

[Intro: Drake & Montell Jordan]
I know that I hurt you
Yeah
I was a child trying to be a man
To all my sons worldwide
I walked out on my only son
All my juniors
I left you in your mother's hands
I apologize for my absence, I know I left you without an annual drop
And now I'm standing right here
I don't know how I expected you to get your clout up and get your money up, but
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes
Don't worry
See your mother raised a fine young man
Daddy's home
And I know I missed so much of your life
Turn me up (Mario)

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah
Niggas know they need to stop
I'm standing at the top, that's how I know you never seen the top
Sierra Canyon parking lot lookin' like Magic City parking lot
Hear the talks when I walk by like you know it's over when we drop
Ayy, drop
Yeah, and I'm coming with the wop
Y'all niggas not poppin'
Fuck her, then she goin' shoppin'
Woah, I'm runnin' out of opps
They're runnin' out of options
Put 'em up for adoption
Sign my name on the dot
Ayy, this is not luck, baby, this no four-leaf, no horseshoe
I'm in the bank thinkin', "Poor you"
I'm in New York goin' Jon Chetrit
Supermodels and they all sexy
Lock the door to the bathroom 'cause they doin' something that is not Pepsi
I'm just pourin' up the shots
I remember that I told you I miss you, that was kinda like a mass text
I remember that I told I loved you, that was really in the past tense
I remember that I told you I get you, truth is that I get around
Mentioned havin' us a kid, '42 hit, I tend to kid around
Yeah, on Benedict with the top down
Shorties out here gettin' knocked down
City coming off a lockdown
Rap niggas doing weak features for a pop artist 'cause they popped down
Used to wanna throw the Roc up, niggas know how I rock now

[Interlude: Drake & Nicki Minaj]
You know how I'm rocking now
YM forever
Big owl, big birds forever
Don't make me go get your mama to talk to you
'Cause if he gotta get your motherfuckin' mama to talk to you, you know what I'm sayin', I'ma bring that motherfuckin' big switch out
At this point, I'ma start collectin' child support the opposite way
You gotta pay me to be my motherfuckin' son, ha-ha-ha-ha

[Outro: Drake & Montell Jordan]
Look at me
Take a real good look at me
Don't turn away
Don't you turn away like I did my son
Look me in the eyes, junior
I'm making no more promises
For real
I'm trying to find the word to say
Daddy's home
Daddy's home (Don't you know)
Daddy's home (Said, your daddy's back home)
Yeah
Daddy's home (For every birthday that I missed)
Wanna be my dad again
We've got to start all over, be friends (Start right here, right now)
If you wanna be my dad again (Said, my only son)
We've got to start all over, be friends (Can you look at me?)
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, that's it
Showtime
Something's happened to me, bro
Ha-ha-ha

[Intro]
(I'm working on dying)
Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
It's like home to me (She belongs to the streets)
It's like home to me
I tatted your passport up
Now it's lookin' like a arm sleeve
Just know that was all me

[Verse 1]
And when you see Chanel, I wish that's how you saw me
That shit you tell Chanel, I wish that's how you called me
That raw shit, that honesty, yeah
You know I love you more than all them niggas put together
And it's a lot of niggas' trust, I put the list together
And it's a lot just to assume we're meant to be together
You gotta live that shit for real, you can't just say whatever
You could never tell nobody that you held me down
If it was ride or die then you should've been dead right now

[Chorus]
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (Right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?

[Verse 2]
Tried to run it back a hundred times
The world is yours, but the city's mine
I can't believe you put it on your mother's life
I can't believe you told me it was ride or die
'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive
True enough I know you from the other side
I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?
That nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice
And I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face
You're the reason we'll be going separate ways
You're the reason we cannot communicate
It's not the things you say, it's what you don't say
I'm not in your way, you're in your own way

[Chorus]
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (Right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?

[Outro]
Baby, pipe down
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 1: Drake]
Told the girls to meet at Tao
Now y'all doin' shots, now them bitches got you fired up
Don't know who you talking 'bout, I'll put that on the Bible
Turnin' up on me, don't make me turn it back around
And you know
Think I'm Tiger Woods, the way I'm teed off thе 17
And you know pockets on whatever, jеans forever green
And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it
And you know (And you know, and you know)

[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Okay, okay, okay
Trenches bitch, I got her a salon
Gucci and Pucci, it's deep in her budget
She hittin' up Virgil for Louis Vuitton
It's not in the Bible to wife off one girl
I'm Muslim, I go by Quran
The way I be smilin' and holdin' my gun
She think I be mimickin' Von, Grandson
She only play me in the whip
India Royale cosmetic, I'm just promotin' my bitch
Drake song do a billion streams for sure, I'm just promotin' her shit
Nasty with it
Take her to Sono Bello and get her some ass and titties
Fashion nigga
Rhude call when they drop like send my addy with it
Bitch left me and I'm glad she did it
Know I be testin' bitches
Back to back, I'm wrestlin' with 'em
Lean voice, I'm raspy with it
I did my dance one time on TikTok and went viral with it
Mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mm, mm-mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mm, mm-mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mm, mm-mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 3: GIVĒON]
You've been on my mind
We've been spendin' time, but I'm scared
A good girl inside (A good girl inside)
But you're tainted every time that I'm there (Tainted)
Here we are now and it's crazy
Held my flaws down to you, baby
You love, you trust, you trust
I'm not what you think
Don't be proud of me
I'm not what you feel
And you gon' see it real soon
I'm not what you think
Don't be proud of me
I'm not what you feel
And when you see the real, will you still want me?

[Intro: Project Pat & 21 Savage]
I gotta feed the streets, my pistol gon' bleed the streets
Ski mask on my face, sometimes you got to cheat
To stay ahead in this bitch-ard (Gang), drank syrup like it's liquor
Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (Yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (Gang)
Flipper, so much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (Yeah, gang)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm mister body catcher, Slaughter Gang soul snatcher
Ain't no regular F-150, this a fuckin' Raptor
No capper, street nigga, not a rapper
Chopper hit him and he turned into a booty clapper
Smith & Wesson, I'm 4L Gang reppin'
We done baptized morе niggas than the damn reverеnd (Yeah)
Kappa Alpha, me and my gang, we do all the steppin'
Who you checkin'? This FN shoot East to West End (Gang)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
I heard Papi outside
And he got the double-R droppy outside
Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside
I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherfuckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that fuckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies

[Verse 4: Drake]
I fuck with her, and fuck with her, and her
I hit up err and tell him do the err, for sure
Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks
Know the dogs had to hit them where we knew it hurts

[Chorus: 21 Savage & Drake]
Gang shit, that's all I'm on (Yeah)
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on

[Verse 5: 21 Savage]
Let it bang, bang, let it bang, bang
'Til his brains hang and his mama sang
And the pastor sang and them bullets sang
And them choppers sang and the choir sang

[Verse 6: Drake]
I'm on everything
Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain
US Open, had it on us at the tennis game
Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, and my men insane
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing
We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it

[Interlude: 21 Savage]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Gang
Metro

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on
Nigga, gang shit, that's all I'm on
Gang shit, that's all I'm on, yeah

[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Oh, yeah, yeah, girls want girls where
Ayy, woah, girls want girls where I'm from, ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cannot play a player, babe
I grew up with Drayaface
I done seen the realest ones come and leave a crazy way
Had to take my spot, it wasn't somethin' they just gave away
Sorry to all my fans that might've caught me on a crazy day
Fuck you niggas thinkin' tryna block me on a fadeaway?
I've been on that shit, I only vibе with a payday
Say you go that way, I guess we both go the samе way
Girls want girls where I'm from
Yeah, yeah, where we both from
Ayy, and you just got to Miami, need hotel rooms
Niggas told you that they love you, but they fell through
So you shotting '42 'cause you
Ayy, and you throwin' on that dress 'cause it's see-through
Yeah, talkin' all the shit that you done been through
Yeah, textin' me and say, "I need to see you"

Oh, yeah, yeah, girls want girls where

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
My girl got a girlfriend
Ain't tryna be out of shape, well, stay up on them curls then
If gym don't work, get surgery
I'll pay for that, my courtesy
Can't imagine no bitch curvin' me
I put in that work overly
I handle business
And I got two pretty bitches, keep 'em both on fleek
They got matching Benz and matching APs
Now they can really call each other twins
I'm cool with all the owners, they love me, so they gon' let us in
And bring all of your peers, it look better with more people
We got 1942, Casamigos, it's getting heated
They gotta follow us in the Uber, my car filled up with shooters
It be lights, camera, action when you with us, it's a movie
I don't drive my coupe to house parties, I'm tryna leave with two of 'em (Shh, shh)
Yeah, don't nobody know the shit that we do
She like eating pussy, I'm like, "Me too"
I can't wait to get off work to go and see you
Please bring your girlfriend along with you
Y'all been on my mind too much, like what the fuck is wrong with me?
She said it's somethin' about the way your girl just makes her feel
Whatever you've been dreamin' 'bout, I swear to make it real
Just ride around the town with me
Then come lay down with me

[Pre-Chorus: Drake & Lil Baby]
I don't know (I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
I might come, I might go, I don't know

[Chorus: Drake]
Starin' at your dress 'cause it's see-through

[Outro: Drake]
But I know you wanna roll with the gang
And I know you want the finest of things
Askin' me about se— settlin' down 'cause you know that things are going my way

[Intro: Juice WRLD]
I think that's what life is about
Truly findin' yourself
And then closin' your eyes and dyin' in your sleep

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi & Drake]
Lifted are my days, my dreams are vivid colors (Woo)
The jet is low, they make me take your trips, we fly by (Let's go)
No stress is on my brain, no worries here, I'm chosen (Yeah, yeah)
Made another way, my nigga, watch me go shine
When I close my eyes my world comes alive (Yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la
People grow, good times sometimes (Nigga)
Real niggas in life survive (Yeah)
And I'm sailing to the edge of my mind
Nigga, double up life (Yeah, yeah)
Set the tempo, got a nympho on my line (Yeah-yeah)
Said she wanna unwind (She do)
And I'm focused on gettin' more
They too stuck on gettin' even, I'm ready for it
We should really be together more
'Cause I know we got some time but I'm never sure

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie
She checkin' for me, now baby come in my dreams, my dreams (Yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Kid Cudi]
Finding myself as the days
Fly by like us on the move
You told me I was a phase
Okay, fine, I miss you too
Probably wouldn't believe me if I told you
Pieces of myself that I should never lose
All these people that love you don't know you
How am I supposed to move?
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
How am I supposed to move?

[Verse 2: Drake]
All my niggas rally 'round me
Bold niggas gettin' real italics 'round me
Finally circled, found the purple
Undisclosed amounts straight from Universal
Too commercial, 'leven years later I done found my purpose
Here I am, oh, they mad
Goin' out swingin' for 'em, goin' out sad

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie
She checkin' for me, now baby come in my dreams, my dreams (Yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Finding myself as the days
Fly by like us on the move
You told me I was a phase
Okay, fine, I miss you too
Probably wouldn't believe me if I told you
Pieces of myself that I should never lose
All these people that love you don't know you
How am I supposed to move?

[Outro: Drake]
Gettin' more
We should really be together more
But I'm never sure

[Verse 1: Drake]
How do you know the way I feel?
You got me losing my mind, oh
Try to suppress my emotions
They're bursting like fountains, baby
They take me up, they take me down
I’m getting weak in my knees, oh

[Chorus: Tems]
I got nothing to admire, taste certain
Baby, longing you make me feel something
I got my eyes on you, pull down the curtain
I'll be patient with you, no more fighting

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tems]
Oh, baby
Come in, come in, yeah, come in
I cannot fathom this life without you
Woah, oh, come in, come in, yeah, come in
This feels like home now
Come in and stay here
Baby

[Verse 2: Tems]
I feel you in my mind
I want to dance tonight
It's in thе air tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know it’s all your fault
No, I don't wanna say no
You'vе broken down the door
Don't make me go, no

[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
I just wanna hold you
I need no control, no
Would you let me love you, me love you?
It's all over
I lost my composure
I got love to show you
Would you let me love you, me love you, baby?

[Chorus: Tems]
I got nothing to admire, taste certain
Baby, longing you make me feel something
I got my eyes on you, pull down the curtain
I'll be patient with you, no more fighting

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 1]
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 2]
Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recording and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 1: Drake]
Told the girls to meet at Tao
Now y'all doin' shots, now them bitches got you fired up
Don't know who you talking 'bout, I'll put that on the Bible
Turnin' up on me, don't make me turn it back around
And you know
Think I'm Tiger Woods, the way I'm teed off the 17
And you know pockets on whatever, jeans forever green
And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it
And you know (And you know, and you know)

[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Okay, okay, okay
Trenches bitch, I got her a salon
Gucci and Pucci, it's deep in her budget
She hittin' up Virgil for Louis Vuitton
It's not in the Bible to wife off one girl
I'm Muslim, I go by Quran
The way I be smilin' and holdin' my gun
She think I be mimickin' Von, Grandson
She only play me in the whip
India Royale cosmetic, I'm just promotin' my bitch
Drake song do a billion streams for sure, I'm just promotin' her shit
Nasty with it
Take her to Sono Bello and get her some massive titties
Fashion nigga
Rhude call when they drop like send my addy with it
Bitch left me and I'm glad she did it
Know I be testin' bitches
Back to back, I'm wrestlin' with 'em
Lean voice, I'm raspy with it
I did my dance one time on TikTok and went viral with it

[Chorus: Drake]
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)

Always in the line again
Alone and tried and true
Her eyes were red and black and blue
Surprised she don't fear that

[Chorus]
Oh, little girl, I know your face, don't ever do that
Alone in the middle
Always in the middle, yeah

[Verse 2]
She thought of driving off one day
To see how it would feel
The road was dark and black and blue
Surprised she'd rather stay

[Chorus]
Oh, little girl, I know your face, don't ever do that
Alone in the middle
Always in the middle, yeah
Oh, littlе girl, I know your face, don't ever do that
Alonе in the middle
Always in the middle, yeah

No one likes to be on the floor
What did you think was gonna happen?
No one likes to feel like a chore

[Intro: Hot Sizzle]
Why not?
I had to do it
I feel the same way
Lets go

[Verse 1: Hot Sizzle]
You said I don't do the simple things I used to do
You say that, that fits me its suitable
You gotta prove to me that's refutable
So when it goes down I'm blamed at the funeral (Dont)
Making it seem like its all my fault
What's the cost if that's all I bought
Words of thought
Course its a misunderstanding using blogs to talk
See I don't thrill disrespectful
Tendencies that I wouldn't dare connect to
Accept means change
When we first got together that's when you said that you most feel special (Special)
From being told "you the best yet"
Being hated only accumulate to death threats
How dare you compare me to the rest
But women do that when they turn you to a ex
Tell me where it begin to hurt
I said "get rid of him and I get rid of her"
We was tryna work on us and all
While we laying in my bed he got the nerve to call, wait
First of all
You said "who is this" made a face disperse the call
I shook my head like I heard it all
I learned from Tank "Maybe I Deserve" it all
What or who did I lose you to?
Was it materialistic something you wasn't used to
In the end I ain't see us together, right along with losing you
That was retrospect but see now we finished
I remember that picture of us without you in it
I'm not fighting for us to work
I'm just fighting to prove my point

[Chorus: Usher]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 2: Usher]
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

[Chorus: Usher]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 3: Usher]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

[Chorus: Usher]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Bridge: Usher]
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

[Chorus: Usher]
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

[Verse 1]
Some folks, they're always crying
Crying their mean old blues
Not me
You never even see me frown

[Verse 2]
Some folks just walk around tryin'
Tryin' hard love to lose
But I say let it come, goodbye to bum
I'm the happiest gal in the town

[Verse 3]
Easy come, easy go
Nothing ever worries me
Care for none
Eyes of stone don't know misery
If my sweet man trifles or if he don't
I'll get someone to love me anytime he want

[Verse 4]
Easy come, еasy go
Right from my head to shoes
Don't wanna be no skinny vamp or nothing likе that
Daddy always knows just where his sweet mama's at
I'm overflowin' with those easy-come-easy-go-blues

[Verse 5]
This world owes me a-plenty lovin', hear what I say
Believe me, I go out collectin' most every day
I'm overflowin' with those easy-come-easy-go-blues

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertimе sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the bеst

[Post-Chorus x3]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (oh oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus x3]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (oh oh oh oh oh)

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

[Post-Chorus x3]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I don't think 'bout anybody
But bein' beside your body, baby (La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You can leave open windows
Don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy (That's just crazy)
Can I slide out mine and into yours?
Heels on, waitin' at your door
I don't wanna play no more
Leave everything on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want is to taste your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip (The way I, way I, I)
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips?

[Chorus]
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deservе to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell whеn you locked the door
Just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes? (Can we take this off and get naked?)
When can we take off all our clothes? (Baby you're so anxious, you can't take it)
When can we take off all our clothes? (Can we take this off and get naked?)

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy
Yeah

[Refrain: Drake]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows

[Chorus: Drake]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

[Refrain: Drake]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth
I–

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
I got one, Laurie got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

[Chorus: Drake]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

[Verse 3: Baby Keem]
I told you that I was a mess, okay
I get out of bed and get dressed, okay
I think about ways I could fuck on your friend
It's something I never confessed, okay
God got me to protect, okay
Mama, I paid out the debt, okay
Baby Keem waiting on wings
You fuckin' him now, I'm gonna be next, one day
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt (Skrt, skrt)
You wake up and floss like I'm not for gossip
You niggas fraud, like I'm in the moshpit
This ain't for stage freight, black out the tint
Then skrt off the lot, went turbo, ferocious, and I–
Your bitch on hypnosis, and I–
Tell the mama that I'm sorry, Baby
Keem way too impulsive, and I–
Baby Keem been a GOAT, we know
Baby Keem for the soul, we know
Keep these hoes on tippy-toe
Your relation with the trolls
Pick him up and wipe his nose
I jump in out that fire
Microwave relationships on IG

[Refrain: Drake]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth
I–

[Outro: Baby Keem]
Happy birthday, bitch
I got a gift for you, it's my dick
Make a wish, make a wish
Make a wish, make a wish, make a wish

[Intro]
It's after hours at that glamorous blank spot
Where they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences
Let's listen in America Today

[Refrain 1]
Straight from Shibuya, on some zen
I'm back, ramped up, I'm on ten
I know revenge is saved only for Him
But it's hard to make amends when mens just gon' be mens

[Verse]
The white picket got me feeling so fenced in
Bipolar don't equal seekin' attention
That's that psy-that's that psychology
Gemini inside of me, it's my dichotomy
Sendin' Christ publicists to get the Christ out of mе
Just to mention His name is a glitch in the gamе
Break all the chains, I ain't had a drink in over 21 days
Certain summers was a bummer, momma made minimum wage
Everybody rocking J's, I couldn't get 'em for days
She was the only one that knew that I would get to that stage
Guess who wouldn't be shocked by anything that I say?
It's getting kinda heavy like when rain broke the levy
We livin' in the years where tears become deadly
And my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy
'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley
I ain’t turn in homework for bout' like 4 months and I bet she let me
She saw the vision
"Yeezy you so special' go make your own decisions then"
Yeah, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce
They tried to take my voice away, I ain't tryna take the choice away
I just pray the water break, just for my daughter sake, from a sip-up
Fake signatures from fake managers, it all damage her, good Lord
Give 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with
The paparazzi never really got what my angle is
They treat my family like, like some type of er'tainment
My niggas still dissin', wonderin' why I ain't saying it
I can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit
I revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it
God is sending you something, make sure that the baby live
And if Ye ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this shit?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute
Let me stop playing with it, God playing 'round with it
Popped in a Lamb with it, in a damn pandemic
Know that Uncle Sam gotta have his damn hand in it

[Refrain 2]
Look, straight from Shibuya, on some zen, I'm on ten
It's a marathon and yet we coming for the win
Just like Puff told Christopher we gon' win big (C'mon)
Put the whole family on, look at what my kin did
Just like Puff told Christopher we gon' win big (Uh)
Uh, we gon win big, woah (What?)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Say you want my company
Sometimes I feel so naive
I don't wanna give up on you easy
Things aren't easy I agree
Why you wanna be this cold to me
Why you wanna make me make believe
Things aren't what they seem
And it got too deep girl, too deep
It's a problem

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

[Chorus: Drake]
Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like your bored of me

[Bridge: Drake]
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means

[Verse 2: Drake]
My yiy's too fried (Ayy)
All these thoughts in my mind
Motives too transparent for me
I know you don't care about me
Dealing with me like some wasteman
You think I live in the palm of your hand
I'm too understanding and patient (Patient)
Lightning might've stricken you right where you stand (Ooh)
And your karma, karma's gonna be a problem

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

[Chorus: Drake]
Now you wanna mention me
When you speak on mistakes
Now you wanna mention me
Like someone could replace me today
Now you wanna mention me
Some emotional statements were made
Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like your bored of me

[Bridge: Drake]
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means more to me
Ooh-ooh
Maybe this means

[Verse 3: Rema]
She did play with my energy, nonstop
You realize that you messing with a gangsta
Oh girl worry 'bout your karma
Tired everyday a lil drama
If you wanna leave just leave, no pressure
If you wanna leave just leave, no pressure
No no no pressure
I will miss ya
If you wanna leave just leave, no pressure
No pressure at all
(Another banger)

[Refrain: Rema]
My girl you whine
Make you dance
Make you move like a rasta
Move dirty wine
Make you dance like a dancer
Give me dirty dance
Like you do, belly dancer
My girl you whine
Make you dance
Make you move like a rasta
Move dirty wine
Make you dance like a dancer
Give me dirty dance
Like you do, belly dancer

[Verse 1]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I’m wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin’ friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 2]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin’ sad
So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Outro]
Ah, aah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, So, baby, come try me (Aah)
Baby, come find me (Ah-ah)
Baby, don't wind me up (Don't wind me up)
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? No
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' sh** to say, uh, ay-ay-ay

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I could crave you, but you don't need to know, I

[Verse 2]
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here (I think I hate it here)
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth)
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, I-I-I
Want it now, mmm, mm-mm-mm
(You can't give me up)

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, ah

[Outro]
Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars
Ooh, I don't know if I can take it anymore
Ooh, I don't know if I can take it anymore

Ooh, I don't know if I can take it anymore (can, can)
Ooh, I don't know if I can take it anymore
Ooh, I don't know if I can take it anymore (can, can)
Ooh, I don't know if I can take it any-
More
There's a big hollow tree
Down the road here from me
Where you lay down a dollar or two
Then you go around the bend
When you come back again
There's a jugful of mountain dew

Oh, they call it that old mountain dew
And them that refuse it are few
Oh, I'll shut up my mug
If you'll fill up my jug

With that good old mountain dew
Well, there's my old Aunt June
Bought some brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellin' phew

But to her surprise, when she had it analyzed
It was nothing but good old mountain dew
And there's Uncle Mort
He's sawed off and short
He's just five feet and one inch or two
But he thinks he's a giant
When he gets him a pint
Of that good old mountain dew

Now, there's Uncle Bill
Got a still on the hill
Where he runs off a gallon or two
And the buzzards in the sky
Get so dizzy they can't fly
Just from smelling that mountain dew

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
You moved like magic, you moved like time
You had your heart disguised
When you cry diamonds, yeah, they shine
But they blind my eyes, and now

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I hear the whispers every night
Even when I'm dreaming
Now, tell me, baby, were you ever mine?

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]
I wanna know who’s in your head?
Stealing your heart while I'm still bleeding
Who's in your bed?
Wrapped in your arms while I ain’t sleeping
Got lost in your halo (Halo)
I just wanna know
Now, who's in your head? In your head? (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know who's in your head? In your head? (Aaoo)

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You moved like danger, but I don't mind (Yeah, yeah)
The way you talking with your eyes, yeah (Your eyes)
You leave me broken, no I can't lie (Can't lie)
It gets me every time, and now

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I hear the whispers every night
Even when I'm dreaming
Now, tell me, baby, were you ever mine?

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]

Stealing your heart while I’m still bleeding
Who’s in your bed?

I wanna know who's in your head? In your head? (Aaoo)

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
You get me down
On my knees
On my knees, yeah
You drive me wild
When you want
When you want it?
Oh you get me down
On my knees
On my knees, yeah
'Cause every time I look into your eyes
(Look into your eyes)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]
I wanna know who's in your head?
Stealing your heart while I’m still bleeding
Who's in your bed?
Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleeping
Got lost in your halo (Halo)
I just wanna know
Now, who's in your head? In your head? (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know who's in your head? In your head? (Aaoo)

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
In your head, still bleeding
In your head, while I'm sleeping
In your head, still bleeding
In your head, while I'm sleeping

They say ev’rything can be replaced
Yet ev’ry distance is not near
So I remember ev’ry face
Of ev’ry man who put me here

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 2]
They say ev’ry man needs protection
They say ev’ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 3]
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he’s not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Lyrics from Snippet

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is it too late for second chances
Give my life to gain your blessings
Trade my pain for all the pleasure
Let your peace sustain my mental
Is it too late for second chances
Love so toxic, and romantic
When you rich you can't imagine
I pray your peace sustains my mental

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
Over and over again lord
Temptations got hold on me again oh
But I ain't doing nothing to change it all
I ended up with her and then
Plot twist now i’m with her best friend
Next thing I know we in a group text
Now we having group sex
Damn I love this shit
It's a lifestyle, can't let go of it
Nothing compares to the perks
When you on percs
Everyday I serve
Swear they keep me smiling at my worst, yeah
Swimming in my feelings in my bag
Fucking all these bitches that they wish

Let's be heroes in the night (In the night)
Like spotlights beaming in the black sky
We could lift the darkness with our light

'Cause everybody says harmony right now (Together now)
Harmony right now (All together now)
Harmony right now (Together now)
'Cause everybody says harmony right now (Together now)
Harmony right now (All together now)
Harmony right now (Together now)

[Outro]
(All together)
All we need
(Were all together)
(In harmony)

[Intro: Kanye West]
For all my people that's—

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song "12 Questions"
We scream: "rocks, blow, weed, park," see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tеll my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on wеlfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is for all my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause they need a extra scratch just so they can shine
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We steal money out the register for extra scratch, then get paid
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"

[Verse 3: GLC]
And now they got me doing bug-stained flow
Way over gold, like my pockets working out
Calls stay over swole poles
Crazy over hoes, flow all up in your nose
At night, I cook coke, smell all up in your clothes
I would use hotplates mane, rarely over stoves
When momma got up on her feet, got heat, never froze
By the time I'm 24, I was back over stoves
Less than a year ago, it was something wonderful
Daddy broke over dro, tryna get them 100 spokes
Smokers up in our hood, watch us weekly overdose
Homies got shot in the head, bled, strictly over-tote
Your folks would stab your back then homies would cut your throat
No, 

[?], hoe, to see tomorrow
87 would swallow hollow tips, never borrowed
Bitch, you gotta honour the way that I live
A product of my environment, don't trifle me
Kids, c'mon

[Chorus: Choir]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
"We don't care what people say"
Lyrics from Snippet

[Skit: DeRay]
You graduated from college as a math major
But now you work at The Gap
You're the smartest person there!

(Chorus)
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back

(Verse)
Before I go I make sure I know it's set
I know what I'mma do, I know what I'mma get
I've been planning this shit my whole bid now
They say "Damn he back in jail? What the fuck he done did now?"
Nothing, but that's all right because I'll be home soon
Matter fact, I should reach the port authority by noon
Tomorrow, and you said they'd never let me go
I told you that I'm coming so act like you know
Mom dukes told me, and I knew it was true
"They got places for little bad motherfuckers like you"
In a way I'm reminded of the very first day
Since the fucked up system, made me pay
For something they didn't catch me doing and I remember then
I swore I'd never go back to jail again
Brothers tell me I'll be back but I know there's no doubt
Because this time (what you doing?), I'm going all out
(Chorus)
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back

(Verse)
Back on the block, it's the same as when I left
I wonder if my mother still lives in 9F
Banging on the door "Ma, I'm home from prison"
Somebody from inside said "We ain't got no more "lism
Comeback a little later, right now it's too hot"
Damn my mother's crib, done turned into a spot
Only one place left for me to go
I went to see my man Joe with the 5.0
Now Joe is kinda cool and sometimes he does favors
For those that he knows and Joe was a savior
He hit me off with something to eat and a Mac-10
A place to sleep, I said "Yo, I'll be back when
I catch up with the kid that snitched on me"
(Yo D what he did?), go out like a motherfuckin' bitch on me
I want revenge and Joe got the picture
He picked up the 9 and said "Uh, I'm coming witcha"
Came off to his place, knocked, he opened the door
I let off in his face, he fell to the floor
Hit him again, cause I wanted to see more blood
Betcha won't tell nothing else to the judge
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back

(Interlude)
Ain't hard to tell know what I'm sayin?
I'm doing what I gots to do (word up)
To get out the penile, whatever happens just gots to happen
Represent for them niggas

(Verse)
Hit the front of the building
Cops, damn somebody got the call
Must've been the man from down the hall
Huh, let's take a hostage, they can come and get us
Cause if we gotta go, a few cops is going with us
Back upstairs down the hall (What you did?)
Kicked opened the door of the man that called (Then what?)
Grabbed his wife, bitch wouldn't stop crying
I told her that she'd be all right (but what), but I was lying
The boys in blue rolled through in a crew
So I started firing, Joe was busting off too
Next thing I remember is the cops still gunning him
The man and his wife too, I had to flat run in them
And even though I ended up cold dead
My word was bond and I was true to what I said
I always knew that I was going to hell
I just refused to go back to a jail cell

(Chorus)
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back
My love she speaks like silence
Above all ideals and violence
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can’t buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People speak of situations
Read books and rеpeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
While somе talk of the future
My love she talks softly
She knows there’s no success like failure
And that failure’s no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawns must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love she’s like a raven
At my window with a broken wing

[Intro: serpentwithfeet]
I thought there was redemption in the four ethers
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, free—

[Verse: Baby Keem]
You know I'm borderline more than rich, had to tame the orphanage
Navigated two bitches, textin' them the coordinates
Two phones literally, house party loiterin'
Deals so dummy had to let several lawyers in
One day, I'll tell you how my life was unfortunate
For now, I'll tell you how fast these Porsches get
Story of the young and reckless, 'bout to eat my bitch for breakfast
Pink pussy been a prеference, nеver fold under pressure
Cheap shots, let it rock, eye open, Fetty Wap
Rain like confetti drop, I bet he drop
I don't hate the trendy things, just don't like to feed the trends
Mama gave me all my sins, love me when the story ends
Flowers on my uncle's tomb, thousands to my auntie's too
I'm used to takin' backstreets, last week was nothing new
Bitches is my scapegoat, who I made this tape for?
I tell the story two years later, for now, the case closed

[Outro]
I've heard so much about it
You talk about it all the time
I wanna go there, inside your mind
Melodic Blue

[Verse 1]
Well, it’s always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

[Verse 2]
Blood dryin’ in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But I don't know what it is makes you think you’ve seen me before
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 3]
Her eyes were two slits that would make any snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint and she was well-endowed
Praising the dead as she rode a donkey through the crowd
Or was it a hyena?

[Verse 4]
Do I need your permission to turn my other cheek?
If you can read my thoughts, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothin' about the man that you seek
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 5]
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

[Verse 6]
A peaceful exchange of ideas for you was always too tame
Inter-tribal warfare was always more your style that your game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 7]
There’s a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half-dead, you’re down to the bone
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown?
In Jerusalem or Argentina?

[Verse 8]
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her strength cards are showin' gold
He’s surrounded by God’s angels and she’s wearing’ a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

[Verse 9]
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take Heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God’s truth name tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course
Just step into the arena

[Verse 10]
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weepin’ and moanin' in unholy places
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina
(Oh, oh Angelina)
(Oh, oh Angelina)

[Intro]
Ain't got no fur slippers now

[Verse 1]
Six o’clock in the evening, I feel so low
Ain't got not girlfriend ain't got no place to go
Even took my fur slippers away

[Chorus]
Oh, ain’t got no fur slippers now

[Verse 2]
Where did she go, where can she be?
Maybe to a movie show, maybe she's watching TV
She was here yesterday, that's all I can say
All that I know she took my fur slippers away

[Chorus]
Oh, ain't got no fur slippers now
Oh, ain't got no fur slippers now

[Verse 3]
I cannot go outside, the ground is too hard
Where can I go? Can't even go in my backyard
Can't drive my car nowhere I don't wanna get in, too
I sure do miss them fur slippers as much as I miss you

[Chorus]
Oh, ain’t got no fur slippеrs now
Oh, ain’t got no fur slippers now

[Verse 1]
Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh-oh Jokerman

[Verse 2]
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
No store bought shirt for you on your back
One of the women must sit in the shack and sew one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh-oh Jokerman

[Verse 3]
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah, but what do you care?
Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Scratching the world with a fine-toothed comb
You're a king among nations, you're a stranger at home

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 4]
Now, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
No crystal ball do you need on your shelf
Michelangelo himself, could've carved out your features
So drunk, standing in the middle of the street
Directing traffic with a small dog licking your feet

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh-oh Jokerman

[Verse 5]
Well, the preacher man talking about the deaf and the dumb
And a world to come, thats already been pre-determined
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, and padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks can't drown out his sermon
You let the wicked walk right into a trap
You give away all the good things that fall in your lap

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh-oh Jokerman

[Verse 6]
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray
A woman just give birth to a prince today and she's dressed in scarlet
He'll turn priests into pimps and make old men bark
Take a woman who could have been Joan-of-Arc and turn her into a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 1]
I seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, “This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To new Jerusalem”
Well, I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I can tell you one thing
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 2]
Mmm, I heard that hoot owl singin'
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Was his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing thе blues
Like Blind Willie McTеll

[Verse 3]
There’s a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He’s dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
Some of them died in the battle
Some of them survived as well
And I can tell you one thing
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 3]
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Hear that undertaker’s bell
But I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 4]
There’s a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He’s dressed up like a squire
Bootleg whiskey in his hand
There’s a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 5]
God is in His heaven
And we all want what’s His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I’m gazing out the window
Of that old St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 1]
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
Maybe we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who’ve lost all ray of hope
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come over herе from over there, girl
Sit down hеre, you can have my chair
I can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I'm not gonna take you there
I wished I’d have been a doctor
Maybe I’d have saved some life that've been lost
Maybe I’d have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah you, I need you

[Verse 3]
I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could I’d bring you to the mountain top, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But it’s like I’m stuck inside a painting
That’s hanging in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can’t move

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s gone but the past live' on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, oh yeah, I need you

[Bridge]
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
Oh, do you remember Napoleon Street
Where you blew Jackie P.’s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line

[Verse 4]
Let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charms
No more affection that’s misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn’t dance

[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you
Yeah, you, I need you

[Verse 1]
They say the wife got the husband drunk
But I don't know, I wasn't there, I was visiting a friend in jail
They sang “Danny Boy” at his funeral and the Lord’s Prayer
Preacher talking ’bout Christ betrayal
It’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
That he reached too high, tumbled back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down

[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back, ain't no goin' back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 2]
He had a brothеr named Paul
You can find him at the Cafe Royalе
Where Miss Trixie plays and the reviews are mixed
He's on the borderline, says revenge is mine
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song about whiskey heaven
And your old cold-blooded love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion where conformity’s in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

[Chorus]
Well, the foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

[Verse 1]
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 2]
Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Not much happening, I got someone to see
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
I got nothing to say, specially about what could or could not be

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 3]
I took an untrodden path once, where the swift didn't win the race
It went to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 4]
Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 5]
It's noontime and I’m still pushing myself along the road on the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 1]
Tell me
Tell me, I’ve got to know
Tell me
Tell me before I go
Does that flame still burn, does that fire still glow?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 2]
Tell me
Are you goin’ somewhere and not sayin’ where?
Tell me
Do you even care?
Tell me quick with a glance or a sigh
Should I hold you close, should I let you go by?
Tell me
Ooh, tell me

[Verse 3]
Are you looking at me and thinking of somebody else?
Can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse?
Have you had any secrets that will only come out in time?
Can you ever be just a stranger to me?
Am I imagining something that ever can be?
Tell me
Ooh, tell me

[Verse 4]
Tell me
Do those neon lights blind your eyes?
Tell me
Behind what door your treasure lies
Is my name written down there in your book?
Should I come back and take another look?
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 5]
Do you think of yourself as somebody’s plaything or toy?
Have you been like a waitress who says “what’ll it be boy?”
Do you have any morals?
Do you have any point of view?
Have you ever longed to ride on that old ship of Zion?
What’s better to you: a live dog or a dead lion?
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 6]
Tell me
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Tell me
Ever do the opposite of what the experts say?
Tell me the truth now, don’t tell me no lies
Are you anybody's somebody prays for or cries?
Tell me
Ooh, tell me
Everybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did
Hе went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends hе would turn his pockets inside out

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

They said, “Listen boy, you’re just a pup”
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill
They said “Congratulations, you got what it takes”
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

He bought the American dream but it was all wet
The only game he could play was Russian roulette
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O’Toole
He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did
He could’ve sold insurance, owned a bakery or bar
Could’ve been an accountant or a tennis star
He was wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay
His mama weeps and cries, his daddy cries and moans
They sleep together in a home they don’t own

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

Well, they're asking me why he couldn’t adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

[Verse 1]
Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the moonlight’s on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 2]
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 3]
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 4]
Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes
State champs white and blue
Yeah, I remember you
You sure had a hell of a view from way up there
High above the yellow pines
And first baptist, "Jesus Saves" sign
I talked to you a million times but
I'm getting out of hand

Water tower, it sure is good to see you
I've been away, way too long
Water tower, like a lighthouse in a storm
You help me find my way back home

How far did you think I'd get
When I pointed my wheels out west?
A little young and dumb, I guess
Gotta learn somehow
Slowin' down and drivin' in
I can finally breathe again
It's likе I found a long-lost friend
God, I've missed this town
Watеr tower, it sure is good to see you
I've been away, way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
You help me find my way back home

You and that lonesome full moon watching over me
I'm right where I'm supposed to be

Water tower, it sure is good to see you
I've been away, way too long
Water tower, like a lighthouse in a storm
You help me find my way back home
You help me find my way
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Keep light, son, go 'sane
Keep my son, but don't change (Dead, dead, dead)

[?] father, 

[?] tame

[?] locked out, it don't rain

[Outro]
I'ma 

[?], that's bae (Dead, dead, dead)
All participation is a myth
I have been manipulated and permanently distorted
There is no justice in road accidents
I am being paid to act weirdly
Up on the ladder the insides are removed
We slide like slime through the flock paper walls
But as you're not really listening you won't notice at
All
We are empty and confused it barely keeps us amused
These are bad clothes for rich folks who have joined
The master race
All we want is to be like you
We beg
For the scraps
From your
Table
There is really no need to fear
Were the orchestra at the ball
Trussed up in tuxedoes
For slaveships

Unforgiving
Pencil sharp
Well at least
You look the part

[Verse 1]
If you're in a forest, out of your mind
Harpies in the branches breaking your arms
If you're stuck in rainbows, shattering glass
Where you miss the moment, watching it pass

[Chorus]
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word

[Verse 2]
When you spend your life wishing on a twinkling star
When you forget how lucky you are
Buried in rubble, sixty foot down

[Chorus]
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running

[Bridge]
When you change your friends like changing your clothes

[Chorus]
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running
I'll come running

[Verse 1]
Why us?
Why not someone else?
Why us?
The cameras are turnin' off our lights
So run away

[Chorus]
And this just feels like
Spinning plates
Our bodies floating down a muddy river

[Verse 2]
While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

[Chorus]
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
Our bodies floating down a
Muddy river

[Extended Outro]
(Why us?)

[Verse 1]
There’s a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

[Verse 2]
Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done, how?

[Outro]
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

[Verse 1]
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

[Chorus]
Don't leave
Don't leave

[Verse 2]
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

[Chorus]
Don't leave
Don't leave

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Well, I will not go down under the ground
’Cause somebody tells me that death’s coming 'round
An’ I will not carry myself down to die
When I go to my grave my head will be high

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 2]
There’s been rumors of war and wars that have been
The meaning of life has been lost with the wind
And some people thinking that the end is close by
’Stead of learning to live they are learning to die

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 3]
I don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see
When someone is pulling the wool over me
So if...

[Spoken Outro]
Do you want this?
Do you want to put this on?
It's awful long, I mean it's not that long, it's just that it's a drag
I sang it so many times

[Verse 1]
Grenadine quarantine, I like you a lot
It's LA, "Hey" on Zoom, Target parking lot
And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend
Someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one, too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is run over, so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

[Chorus]
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

[Verse 2]
Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothing to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that?

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I'm complicated, my life's sorta, too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
'Cause I sing like an angel, my heart's like one, too
The only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

[Chorus]
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
They said I was bad and I'll show them what bad girls do

[Outro]
My black bathing suit
(Oh, let 'em talk about me)
They're just yesterday's news
(They're fucking broke and we're laughin' about them)
Mail me when you get the blues
(We'll have the last laugh about it)
By the way, thanks for the shoes
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks out of it
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me (So, thanks for that)
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me (So, thanks for that)
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that

[Verse 1]
Put your red boots on, baby, giddy up
Baby wants to dance, baby gets her way
Treat me nice, talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice, I'll treat you like a holiday

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Babe, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

[Chorus]
Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the Fourth of July
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

[Post-Chorus]
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

[Verse 2]
Get your jacket on, be a gentleman
Get into your truck and pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for the long-haul freight train
Burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down, lie next to me

[Chorus]
Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like, six times 'til I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

[Post-Chorus]
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Let's keep it simple, babe
Don't make it complicated
Don't tell me to be glad when I'm sad
I really hate that
I try not to be bad
He's interested, he's holding me back
If I could be more like you, I would
But I can't and I'm glad about that

[Pre-Chorus]
What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

[Verse 2]
Let's keep it simple, babe
We can't afford to change it
Don't turn me into something I'm not
There's no way to sustain it
I try not to hold back
It seems, either way, it makes you mad
So I'll be who I'll be, if you think that that's cool
Then I'll take you back

[Pre-Chorus]
What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

[Verse 1]
There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy
Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with the city
Like thе Paramount sign sparkling
Sparkling just for me

[Chorus]
You made me tradе my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha

[Verse 2]
There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the Merthys Alleys
In the streets have ceased
And still, the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you, I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

[Chorus]
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryin' to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
(Ah-la-ha, ah-ha)

[Outro]
There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy

[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
Don't have to write me a letter
'Cause I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

[Pre-Chorus]
We love every hair on your head
Love you like God loves you
And you say that you're scared
Might be unprepared for havin' the baby blues

[Chorus]
Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

[Verse 2]
You name your babe Lilac Heaven
After your iPhone 11
"Crypto forever," scrеams your stupid boyfriend
Fuck you, Kevin

[Pre-Chorus]
We lovе every freckle you have
We love you like God loves you
If you're ever stressed out, just dance in the night
If you get those baby blues

[Chorus]
Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

[Bridge]
Pink slippers all on the floor, woven nets over the door
It's as close as we'll get to the dream that they had
In the one night sixties, and
Jason is out in the lawn
And he power-washes every time things go wrong
If you're stressed out, just know you can dance to your song
'Cause we got you

[Chorus]
If you get the blues, baby blues
Just know this is your song
It'll live on and on, way past me and you
If you get the blues, baby blues
You've got us, we've got you
So there's nothing to lose, and we love you

[Outro]
So don't write me a letter
I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

I'm about to crash into the water, gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive, end it all so legendary
I'm about to crash into the water, gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive, end it all so legendary

[Verse 1]
Overloadin' when I'm looking in the mirror
Feel myself, I'm looking way better than ever
Overloadin' when I'm looking in the mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash, I

All or nothing, burn in Hell or go up, heaven-sent, yeah
Wheels up on the curbside, put it in speed drive

I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash, I

I'm high voltage, self-destructive, end it all so legendary, yeah

[Intro]
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up (Ooh)
Lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up (Ooh)
Lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

[Chorus]
Hang on ball and chain
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you)

[Verse 1]
It ain't about the money, don't matter where you're from
Don't care 'bout what you believe in
Or who you wanna love
Let's get back to basics, before we turn to dust
Forget about all the illusions
Tonight it's us

[Chorus]
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Ooh)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Ooh)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

[Verse 2]
Sweat drippin' out our body, that's how we shed our pain
The monsters waiting outside, like poison for the brain
Things get a little bit crazy, don't need to feel ashamed
There's no more time for cryin'
Tonight's for us

[Pre-Chorus]
DJ, play our worries away
You can be our savior
Keep on lightin' me up, on lightin' me up
On lightin' it up

[Chorus]
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you for life

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

[Bridge]
Trapped inside the rhythm world, I feel free
Let me be your prisoner
Suffocated by the beat, lets me breathe
Keep on lightin' me up, keep on lightin' it up

[Chorus]
Hang on ball and chain
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain
Don't let go, I need you (Need you, need you, need you)
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Shine on, keep me dancin' all night
Hang on ball and chain (Hang on)
Don't let go, I need you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Baby, you need me and I need you to survive)
I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives (I'll be dancin', we'll be dancing for our lives)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Take my hand and let's get shackled)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life

[Outro]
Baby, you need me and I need you to survive (Hang on)
I’ll be dancin', we’ll be dancing for our lives
(On lightin' me up)
Take my hand and let's get shackled on my light (Hang on)
Don't let go 'cause I need you for life
(On lightin' me up)

[Spoken:
"That's all I do?
I'm just a ditz with a credit card?"]

Day off in Kyoto, got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train and went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't

Called from a payphone
Yeah, they still got pay-phones
It cost a dollar a minute
To tell me you're sober and you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

I'm gonna kill you if you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world 'til I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind

Sunset's been a freak-show on the weekend
So I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and stare at the chem-trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by, like, ten days
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it
25 felt like flying

I don't forgive you but please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

Guess I lied
I'm a liar

Day off in Kyoto
Day off in Kyoto
Day off in Kyoto
Day off in Kyoto
Day off in Kyoto

[Intro: Dylan Brady]
G-g-g-g-g-gec
Back once again
A-a-and you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
Anything about me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
When we were together, I tried to tell you
I used to tap dance and I was in choir
And I broke my arm when my dad crashed a go-kart
He didn't mean to, my mom didn't buy it
I tried on your lipstick, I thought I looked pretty
But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy
And you're always busy, so you never hear me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
So you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Do I sound like a joke when I'm talking to you?
I take it back quick and I nod like "true"
'Cause you say so many things, and I don't know what I mean
Short messages to you, short messages to me
Now if I think of a joke when I say goodbye
I put my palms on my face and pretend to cry
But I'll laugh too fucking hard, you prob'ly think I'm so mean
But I don't even know you, and now you'll never really know

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Bridge: Laura Les]
I guess it's such an easy game, ga-ga-game, ga-ga-game
If it put you right to sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep
Rationale, a cheap cliché, ché-ché-ché, ché-ché-ché
I wouldn't call that sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep
Could you explain it all away? (Way-way-way, way-way-way)
Like it was all so clean? (Cle-cle-clean, cle-cle-clean)
Something said about the, wait-
Okay bet, I forget
And I guess I never knew, but I don't think I'll forget, it's cool
I guess you'll never know

[Chorus: Dylan Brady and Laura Les]
Know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me

[Outro: Dylan Brady and Laura Les]
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me (Wooooh!)
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
Yeah, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
What you crying about baby?
Are you getting lazy?
Clear blue sky but it rains all the late fees
Did you get the payment? We had an arrangement
We don't wanna watch the news, we just read statements
Do you wanna party? Malibu Barbie
Are you gonna pack that shit up when it all comes tumbling down?
Do you wanna party? Malibu Barbie
Are you gonna pack that shit up when it all comes tumbling down?

[Pre-Chorus: Laura Les]
Go pitch your fit, no one gives a shit
Better off if you just get over it

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'm going crazy
Little tiny Hollywood baby
Brand new Mercedes
I’ve been in the crib going crazy
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Living in the moment
What you crying 'bout, crying 'bout, crying 'bout now?
Buckle under pressure
Came tumbling, tumbling, tumbling down

[Pre-Chorus: Laura Les]
Go pitch your fit, no one gives a shit
Better off if you just get over it

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'm going crazy
Little tiny Hollywood baby
Brand new Mercedes
I’ve been in the crib going crazy
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh, oh whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa-oh

[Outro: Laura Les]
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby
You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby

[Interlude: Laura Les]
Oh, Jamie... let me tell you something about that about that "Jamie": he's got knuckle tats that spell out "violence," and "fuck you" poked out on both of his eyelids. But nobody knows 'cause he never blinks. Yeah, he uses a lighter to cook up his steak, but sometimes complains that he leaves it in his wake

[?] He never speaks 'cause his teeth are all busted, but if he did, you know that son of a bitch would be cussin'; He's crazy, I don't know who gave him a gun, he's fucking crazy, I'd stay away from him if I were you...

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Billie knows Jamie, Jamie's got a gun

When he gets that look in his eye, you don't know what he'll do

No, what the fuck are we gonna do?
I don't know what—

[Verse 1]
I look in your eyes
I told her relax
You've come for a ride
There's no turning back
I've been there before
It's all that you need
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

[Bridge]
I know that you like to dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

[Verse 2]
Its been so long
Don't overreact
You've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
Just open the door
Don't look at me
This world is for us
It's all that it seems

[Bridge]
I know that you love to dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gonе blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature madе friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes (Those ocean eyes)
I'm scared (I'm scared)

Shut the fuck up

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Woah, woah)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash detergent
Internet urgent, time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in a copacetic manner
Camouflage like a sheep, so we slide through the cancer
Lies and deceit, vibe like a Phantom
Dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house

Rolex, woah, arm on froze

Your leverage in the back
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash
Get gone like The Flash, Flash, Flash
Let's add and subtract, math
I see that you look at these VV-VVs
Let's get you a piece for me

[Chorus]
I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real nigga in your life

It's some niggas goin' stupid in here, I must admit it
Got my eye on one of many, she look like a flight attendant
I know it's a few ballplayers that been hit it
You gotta come see me first, you know you in my city
Sin City, headed East until you near me

[Chorus: Che Ecru]
Pussy-ass nigga, you ain't know that shit (Uh)
Back of the club with a fat-ass bitch (Ayy)
I'ma call your ho when I call at night
She won't come to door when a nigga outside
Call me up a Uber, I ain't leavin' for shit
Call me in the mornin' when you needin' some dick
Call me in the nighttime when you needin' some dick
Call me any day (Anytime) when you needin' the dick

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
Ayy, spent a lot on your hair
Spent a lot just to take you on a trip and keep it playa
Put my soul in these condoms, spent time, lil' bitch
Laid up at the crib on some Seinfeld shit
We overdue for some fuckin', huh
We overdue for some suckin', huh
We overdue, we overdue, we overdue
We overdue, we overdue, bitch, huh?
I need hands in the air (Air), hand up in the air (Air)
If I lose my open (Ooh), shit just won't be fair (Fair)
I spent all night there (There), it cannot be fair (Oh, oh)
If I can't see where you're goin', I'll wait all night

[Chorus: Che Ecru]
Pussy-ass nigga, you ain't know that shit (Uh)
Back of the club with a fat-ass bitch (Ayy)
I'ma call your ho when I call at night
She won't come to door when a nigga outside
Call me up a Uber, I ain't leavin' for shit
Call me in the mornin' when you needin' some dick
Call me in the nighttime when you needin' some dick
Call me any day (Anytime) when you needin' the dick, ayy

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, already livin' my truths
Can't sabotage my love for nothing
'Member I had to choose, "Lord, help me" 'cause I couldn't say nothin'
This remind me of them days before I was buzzin'
Whеn my auntie told me
"Come insidе the house, you make a mess, I'll kick you out"
Don't saturate my love for some respect, I cannot vouch
Judgin' from my shoes and all they seein' is the couch
My moral what I stand on so I got up and I bounced

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Verse 2]
(Mmm-mmm)
In the backseat, holdin' on for dear life, I must
(Mmm-mmm)
Runnin' them streets, thinkin' that I'll never get touched
(Mmm-mmm)
I've hit the point where enough is never enough, yeah
I gotta see my ceiling with those I trust (Ooh-ooh)
I'd rather feed my feelings with those I lust (Ooh-ooh)
You know what it means, I had low self-esteem
We was livin' on the east side
And I had to pack up my things when my mama was 'sleep
Two kisses to the peace sign
That's when life was on the decline
Two bus passes I'll be fine

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Bridge]
(Close your mind a little bit)
Can you blame us?
(Random thoughts in my head)
You can blame us
(Can't get the bad out my head)
Can you blame us?
(Is this from the pain I had)
Can you blame us? (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
I need a new fixation (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Open the conversations (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Starting to lose my patience (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Inviting new temptations

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life You gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, ever since day one
Pop a 911 and pop another one

Turning up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting too manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

I can't see me cry
Can't see mе cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see mе cry
This is the end (ooh)

My biggest en- is still me
Pop a 911
My biggest en- is still me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop another one
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save them 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built me around my oasis
Paradise is in my hand
Holding on so tight to this status
It's not real but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry
This is the end (ooh)

My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911 (End, end, end, end, end)
My biggest, my biggest, my biggest, my biggest

My biggest en- is still me
Pop a 911
My biggest en- is still me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop ano-

You got me running 'round the country, I'm tryna find you
I need a girl I can relate to and confide to
See me dealin' with the mob, how you let me do it?
Can't trust, can't trust, girl, you made me do it
I can hide you in the bed, keep on lock the bedroom
Killstreaks, killstreaks when I need some leg room
Introduce you to the homeless, you ain't know him
On the flight back to Paris, I gotta show 'em

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
Baby, did I make you proud?
I know I'm hard to handle
I'ma come break you down

You ain't gotta bide the time for emotionals
You in the box just to see a new spectacle
Me, I spent a lot of time in the gutter, though
I'm a cutthroat freak, don't get it, though
Let’s take a walk around here, on the road, dawg
All these niggas out here, sellin' they souls, dawg
Are you really here for me? Are you my bro, dawg?
I don't want another woman, it's a roll call
And I see the good relationship with your mama
Educated, Harvard-made it and your honored
And I know the good morals on your socials
First Lady, President, you in the Oval
I'm at the '02, I'm going postal
You on the side stage, I had to show you
They told you I was next up, when I told you
I had to fall back just to get to know you

I gave you hell, I'm so down by myself
Killstreaks, killstreaks...

[Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

[Chester Bennington]
You love the way
I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away
If I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

[Chester Bennington]
I won't believe
A word you say
I'm cut to pieces by the sound of every breath you take
Swimming through a
See of hurt
My life, my pride is stronger

[Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
It's time to sink or swim
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
(No)
It's time to sink or swim
(No)
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
(No)
It's time to sink or swim
(No)
To see who gets scared when the lights go dim
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

[Verse 1]
And hate runs through my blood
Well, my tongue was in love
But my heart was left above
I've gotta be leaving now
I thought I'd never be shut down
But, girl, I'm black and blue
So beaten down and blue
Well, I'm beaten down and blue

[Chorus]
Don't break away
I waste away

[Verse 2]
And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
I had no chance to get away
I can't escape my own escape
Even more when it's sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sensе astray
I look up and seek through faith
Oh, but, girl, just lean over and say
Well, lay mе down
Well, I pull me out
Well, take my crown
See, he's submerged in doubt

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Wait, I'll make my last request
I see this could be the best
But, blue, I need to rest
Well, I've been broken down
So much has lost it now
I just stop to say
Well, girl, don't you worry 'bout a thing

[Outro]
Baby, well, don't you worry anymore, ah
Well, my baby
Well, my God
Now you're lying on the floor

[Intro]
And no help still
And no help still

[Verse 1]
She said it hurts when he stares at lights
I guess my brain was full, indecision on the lefthand side
But the doctor said it's cool, just take these in the dead of night
Within the deepest sleep, you'll fall, my head hit bed, but my mind's still alive

[Refrain]
These pills just make me, these pills just make me drool
These pills just make me, these pills just make me, these pills just make me, thеse pills just make me drool
Thеse pills just make me, these pills just make me, these pills just make me, ah

[Verse 2]
I told him he weren't doing things right
So he put me on some more, no change as a year flew by, woo
I gave that fraud a call, he sniggered when I told him my plight

[Refrain]
He told me I was, he told me I was wrong
He told me I was, he told me I was, he told me I was

[Verse 4]
And now she's sat here in the deep of night
She's sitting in a pool, makes incisions on the righthand side

[Refrain]
Her blood is in me, her blood is in the song
Her blood is in me, her blood is in me, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in the song
Her blood is in me, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is in me, yeah, her blood is on the walls

[Outro]
And no help still
And no help still
And no help still
And no help still

[Verse]
I'm used to saying, "I don't belong"
A burdened youth outcast from young
But how are you? I'm wasting your own time
And once consumed, spit gunk from lungs
To tell the truth, I haven't done
But how are you? I'm wasting your own time
My skin is bleach, my hair is long
I have no teeth, I've never done
My gums are raw and bleeding all the time
The shapes are grey, the cityscape
Bourgeoisie change to replicate
How can I be feeling the same as you?

[Outro]
'Cause they
Girl, they
Won't be wasting my time
Thеy
Sun will sink
I never know
Won't be wasting my timе
Won't be wasting my time
They
Won't be wasting my time
They
Girl, they
Girl, they
Won't be wasting my time

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Could we meet here until the end of time?
Oh, girl
I don't know why
I don't know why

[Verse 1]
In soft bleeding
We will unite
We ooze two souls of pastel blue like
From heightened touch to losing sight
Swimming through the cool lagoon, basking in the dark of night
Of depths unknown to be explored, girl, we sink together through the sky

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I search for you, could we align?
Could we meet here until the end of time?
She said, "Don't forget, things may change sometimes"

[Verse 2]
A lovers sigh to bе absorbed
But I let go, I sleep alone as sorrow weeps my lucid еye
Abandoned bodies by numb minds
The universe salutes and Lucifer cries
Within your heartbeats, you say goodbye
Within your heartbeats, you strum goodbye, I, I, I
I don't know why
Is anybody out there?
Anybody out there?

[Outro]
Girl
Could we align?
I search for you
Could we align?
Is anybody out there?
I don't know why
I search for you
Could we align?
Is anybody out there?
I don't know why

[Verse 1]
There's a television
There's a television
Speaking to me
There's a French girl
On my television
She's crying
In the palm of my hand

[Verse 2]
In moving metal
I read the paper, or just the photos
I rip one out with my hand
There's a massacre
Across the o-, across the o-, across the o-, across the ocean
I can see it in the palm of my hands

[Interlude]
Me hundo cada vez más hondo

[Verse 3]
Below the ground floor
We're losing signal, we've lost connection
I left her dying
She was still crying
Now she's lying in my head

[Verse 4]
Above the third rail, trash still flying
Next stop's wobbling, but I'm riding to the end
What am I good for?
I've got no signal
Abandoned to the voice in my head

[Outro]
Uh, we're gonna slow it down a bit

[Intro: King Krule]
Thank you all for coming out tonight
This next song's called "Slush Puppy"
One, two, three

[Verse: King Krule & Jacob Read]
Don't you dare, baby, dare, baby, dare
Deface me already, replace me already
Nothing is working with me
Nothing is working with me
Don't you dare, baby, dare, baby, dare
Deface me already, replace me already
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared
Deface me already
I'm a waste, baby
Girl, I'm so alone
'Til you come over
Whilst I'm down under swingin'
Nothing is working with me (Nothing is working with me)
Nothing is working with me (Nothing is working with me)
Nothing is working with me (Nothing is working with me)
Nothing is working with me (Nothing is working with me)
Nothing is working with me, oh, ah (Nothing is working with me)

[Outro: King Krule & Jacob Read]
Everyone, everyone show some love for Jerkcub
Ayy, ah

[Intro]
This next song is dedicated to a Mr. Jacob Read
A Mr. Moody
Mr. MC Pinty
Mr. Michael Colvill here
And Mr. Bream

[Verse 1]
I've hit rock bottom
Ooh, now I'm running away
I've made it, babe
Think what your lover would say
Think in a brotherly way
See, girl, I won't say
Until it finds me
One day

[Verse 2]
My mind starts to derange
Distortions arrange as sight loses its range
As everyone's perspective begins to change, girl
Ooh, I'm the same
Just something to blame
Another thing wrong with the game
And watch me as I descend
Into shame
Into
Into shame
Into
Into shame

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And whеn your heart's got no more, you're lying dеad on the floor
The wounds in your back are still sore
And everyone who watched you watched on in awe
But now you see who's nothing but poor
Another lost soul who never accomplished a goal or made a light out their lives
And they're the ones who pulled out the knife
And like that, oh, everything is gone in front of your eyes
Your hands lost their grip on their prize
And you've got no more tries
'Cause you lost them through lies
Oh, but your lucky this time
And hopefully it'll make you seem more wise, or otherwise
They'll leave you to your own demise

[Verse 4]
'Cause it's the end of something I did not want to end, beginning of hard times to come
And something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was
Girl, what was
Girl, hey

[Outro]
Girl, I can't hold this down much longer
This ocean current, girl, your current's stronger
Girl, I wonder if I should ponder or just stay down
Pour it all out
See, I'm bathed in doubt
'Cause we was in doubt

[Chorus]
You're my everything
Make me feel alright, you're the only thing
Make me feel just fine, you're my everything
Make me feel alright, you're the only thing
Girl

[Bridge]
I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go

[Verse]
And in my silence, it's so menacing
And when I'm left alone, it's so damaging
And in my violence, the walls cave in
Girl, I'm not able to escape it all

[Bridge]
'Cause you're my everything, I have no worth
And you're thе only thing that makes life work
Thought I hated еverything, but it's not worth
Thought I hated everything
Another lonely night
Another lonely night
Another lonely night

[Chorus]
You're my everything
Make me feel alright, you're the only thing
Make me feel just fine, you're my everything
Make me feel alright, you're my everything
Girl

[Outro]
I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go, girl
I guess I have to go
Girl
I guess I have to go

[Intro]
I don't really have too much to say

[Verse 1]
Not again, Peckham Rye, half five
Boy on the ground with his pants down, what happened to him in his past life?
What happened to him in his park side?
Roads were busy, buses passed by
I wonder who saw me, I was the last guy
Think it was Willem, said I was headed in through the poolside
Hustled the cold keys 'til 5AM, but all I got was swept aside
Like the pesticide in your vegetables in summertime

[Chorus]
Like the worries of those at thе worst times
Like the worriеs of those at the worst times
Like the worries of those at the worst times
Is my brain fried?
Woo

[Verse 2]
Not again, Peckham Rye, half five
Boy on the ground with his pants down, what happened to him in his past life?
Spilled blood from his dome in his pastime
Has it happened again? Is my brain fried?
Is the gold fine?
At least my nose ain't bent and my face sliced
And he asked for a light, when he offered a line
Fought from worst of men, but I'm glad to decline
Must've triggered somethin', enhanced masculine
After I push it in, self-esteem insulin

[Chorus]
Contorts the glows at the worst times
It contorts the glows at the worst times
At the worst times

[Refrain]
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste (A waste)
Of time (Of time)
A waste

[Outro]
Jacob, Jacob, take a break, take a break, chill

[Verse 1]
Take a dip, if you're alone, take your time
Take a ticket, take the train to the end of the line
See where you can go, we spent it, it's plastic, no do or die
Better flip it, think about it, then you'll do just fine, girl

[Refrain]
These things will come and go
Deep in the metropole
Hey

[Verse 2]
Throw a stone, see it land, forget its flight
Draw a line in the sand between your thighs
Oh, just to see which way you go
So you got this, you're the lead, feel your own
Battle through it, consume it, then let it go, girl

[Refrain]
But don't forget you'rе not alone
Deep in the metropolе

[Verse 3]
The ache of thunder in the storms of your mind
Soak it in, for the rain will pass in time
Nothing wrong with sinking low
You're the omen of paradise
You're the ghost they put aside, girl

[Bridge]
But don't forget you're not alone
And sometimes you're stretched
But don't forget you're not alone
And sometimes you're stretched

[Outro]
Every minute, every second, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone
Everyone must know
Everyone must know
Girl, you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone

[Segue]
All I can see is her mouth
It's motion, it's urgent, it's trigger

[Segue]
Pulling us in

[Verse 1]
My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl, I could've been someone to you
Would've painted the skies blue

[Refrain]
Baby blue
Girl, only if you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 2]
Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl, I've got no chance, girl, and nothing to say
Girl, but stay here for a little while

[Verse 3]
But if only
Girl, you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last, baby

[Outro]
You were my slave, can't you see?
This problem is I feel, I feel like I built this world for your being
I had to change, I had to remove so many things to be
I had to change, I had to change all I could, but it still wasn't good enough for me
I was tirеd, I was living life, I was tired
Running down under thе high rises
Nothing was out there, is there anybody out there?
'Cause I was bathing at home
It was a, it was a, it was a whole world that no one knows
Is there anybody out there?
'Cause I'm all alone
Is there, is there anybody out there, girl?

[Outro]
Everyone show some love for Gal Go on the sax
On bass, we have James Wilson, woo
On the keys, we have Jamie Isaac
On guitar, we have Jack Towell
And the one, the only, Mr. George Bass

Half man with the body of a shark

Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark

[Verse 1]
Half man with the body of a shark
Man, know you left me in the dark for days
Oh, man, if you try and it works, well, maybe it can stay
It was a corrosive touch, I just lost too much of my soul
Perhaps the emotive rush turned my brain to mush, girl, I'll never know
I'll never know

[Chorus]
You were so fine in the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyеs in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts bеcome menacing
Watch this raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body, hey

[Verse 2]
Perhaps the emotive rush turned this brain to mush
Girl, I had to let go, showed too much
To let this place combust, you must refrain from lust
Dismantle the throne

[Chorus]
You were so fine in the moonlight
Head aligned with your eyes in my sight
Caught everything
Simple soft thoughts become menacing
Watch this raw adrenaline
Racing through my bones, racing through my body, oh

[Bridge]
And if you don't know and if you don't care, don't try hide it
You're not even there
And if you don't know and if you don't care, don't try fight it
You're not even aware
And if you don't know and if you don't care, don't try hide it
You're not even there
And if you don't know and if you don't care, don't try fight it
You're not even there, ayy
Brother, brother
I've only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
They make it hard for us to understand
Brother, brother
I've only got two fighting hands
Brother, brother
Make it hard for us to get together in this land
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
Half man with the body of a shark
And if you don't know and if you don't care, don't try hide it
You're not even there, ayy
And if you don't know and if you don't care, don't try fight it
You're not even there

[Outro]
Girl, you'll never know
At least when you look to the stars, they still glow
But not for me, though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Girl, I suppose
I'll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown
Girl, I'll forever be alone, ayy
Girl, I'll never know
At least when you look to your stars, they still glow
But not for me, though
Body and head are empty, even when we're toe to toe
Girl, I suppose
I'll forever be the only one who knows
Aspirations ingrown
Girl, I'll forever be alone

[Outro]
Woo

[Intro]
One, two
I'm just a piece of shit
The moon hangs, up above
Makes judgment of all of us
Girl, I've had enough of what you think of me
I wasn't sure of what I was supposed to be
The demon's keep on showing up in times of need
Set me free

[Verse 1]
Nothing ever made me feel the way you do
Is it real?
You came at last
You lock the door and run the bath
Girl, I was doing good, I was keeping
Kept my head up above your intimacy or steadily
Your putrid ooze came to swallow me
Is it meant to be?
And find me those big sad eyes
I lay you down on the empty streets that always seem to lead me to you

[Chorus]
Under the underclass
Deep in society's hole
That's where I saw you last
And we're beneath it all
I had this feeling I was coming back
But little did I know

[Verse 2]
But little did I know
That the numbs spread through me, girl
I let that fire grow cold
And prepare that bed for me
I'm under your control
Under the underclass
Deep beneath it all
I had this feeling I was coming back
But little did I know
But little, little did I know

[Outro]
Guess I had this feeling I was coming back good
But little did I know
Figure it on your own
That's the way, figure it out your own
That's the way, figure it out your own
And sometimes—

[Intro]
Energy fleets

[Verse 1]
Where are you going?
The day's about to end
Such a funny life
I lead
I think about it all the time
I bleed
Watch it flow right out of me

[Verse 2]
Why'd you stop reading?
When the page is 'bout to turn
It's such a funny life
I lead
I see it circling the times
I sleep
Yeah, someone told me it gets worse
I disbelieve
Thought I'd be overseas
Curing disease but
Now it's part of me

[Outro]
All the diseased
Such a funny life
It's such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
It's such a funny life
It's such a funny life
It's such a funny life

[Verse 1]
Please complete me
It must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numb that surrounds
Why aren't you near me?
What stars are you under?
If only I could be with you right now
Did your mind ever clear me?
Has your faith found a pastor?
Am I still in shapes in the clouds?
Did you see me on TV?
Have you seen the disasters?
We don't have long 'til this earth is drowned
If only I had seen clearly as we lay beneath thunder
Feeling the feeling of pride, the pride that brought me down
When they all stood and cheerеd me what made your departurе?
Am I still walking off in the crowd?

[Verse 2]
Insincerely
Eros' bow has no archer
Icarus still soars above the ground
The moon appears freely but arose to a structure
And our days and nights have been constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be numbness around
This place doesn't move me, girl
Everything's just letting me down

[Outro]
Thank you for coming out tonight
I always, I always like coming here

[Intro]
This is our last song

[Verse 1]
Well, same old Bobby, same old beat
Well yeah, they got nothing on me
The same old cars, same old streets
But yeah, they got nothing on me, I
Easy come and easy go
Well yeah, I'm sure I told you so
Well, they just want you for your dough
Well yeah, I'm sure I told you so
And while your dead-end job
Has been eating away your life
You feel little inside
The trouble and strife
And now you spend your evenings
Searching for another life
Well yeah, I think, matе
I think you've got her in your sights

[Chorus]
Well, еasy easy
No need to take that tone
Well, easy
Man, just leave us alone
I'll be one minute on the phone

[Verse 2]
Ow no I should've kept my receipt
'Cause the sandwich I bought
It's been off for a week
And 'low Tesco's stealing my money
When positivity seems hard to reach
I keep my head down and my mouth shut
'Cause if you’re going through hell
Well, just keep going

[Outro]
Well, you're easy
Man, just leave us alone
I'll be one minute on the phone, woah

[Intro]
Hold myself my bands, count up all my bands
She my only fan
I was in my hovercraft, have another laugh
Go on, do the math, spotlight in the man

[Chorus]
Got this on remote control
Got this on remote control
Got it on remote control, like they used to know
I thought you should know, ooh-woah-ooh-woah

[Verse]
Yeah, He got the plan, you can't force my hand
Bitch, why you so mad?
Keep recording

[Interlude]
He got this, He got this
He got this, He got this

[Pre-Chorus]
He got this on remote control, like a sink in gold
He got it, spotlight in the man, spotlight in the man
He got it on my hovercraft, have another laugh
Go on, do the math, spotlight in the man

[Chorus]
He got it on remote control
He got it on rеmote control
He got it on remotе control, like they used to know
I thought you should know, ooh-woah-ooh-woah

[Pre-Chorus]
On remote control, like a sink in gold
Spotlight in the man, spotlight in the man
I was in my hovercraft, have another laugh
Go on, do the math, spotlight in the man

[Chorus]
Got this on remote control
Got this on remote control

[Verse 1]
I've got this feeling inside me
Lust is burning
Meaning striped and deserted me
Left on my own with my hostile conscience

[Verse 2]
All these nights were spent working late
I looked for a better fate
I would be altogether over soon
Over the skies for my Japanese exile

[Bridge]
A smooth three-sided copper be my way
Twelve times a vigor
