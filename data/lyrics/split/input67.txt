I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on

[Verse 2: Life]
I'mma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'mma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
I can flip raps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
And leave your head in a spin like starin' at turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - this is real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that, cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vibes I create, this heavy weight, I'm about to detonate
And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
To the top of my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete

[Hook: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on…
I can't help my self from sittin here missin you

You can keep on thinkin i'm sittin here missin you
But i wasn't playing when i said that we're through
Just likin you
Every time that i fall for you
I'm sick of these games

Just like somebody breaking your trust
When its handed to you

You, make me smile

Take my hand
And don't let go i want you to know
I love you all the while

Cry no more

With no regrets the day i said that we're through
Just like you do
Every time i fall for you
You'll keep lyin
But i will keep tryin
Just like somebody breaking your trust
When its handed to you
I'll never fall in love with you
Saying now or never
I'd rather it be forever

We'll make it right
Just promise you'll be true
And i'll wait for you yeah ah ah
Cause i'll never get over you
Yeah
Whoa
Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
There's no stopping me

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't know about tomorrow
All I've got is today
I'm not wastin' time worryin' 'bout
How things might change
The sun will think about the moon
When its comin' out at night
I'm just gonna shine
'Cause I'm havin' the time of my life

[Chorus]
I wanna fly, I wanna be free
Like a butterfly
Gettin' my wings
I wanna run as fast as I can
Don't wanna let anyone hold me back
I can be anything I wanna be
There's no stopping me

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna see the world
Gonna take in all I can
See everything through the eyes of love
And try to understand
That everybody's different
And that's got to be okay
I'll find all my strengths
And let go of my mistakes

[Refrain]
Yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna fly, I wanna be free
Like a butterfly
Gettin' my wings
I wanna run as fast as I can
Don't wanna let anyone hold me back
I can be anything I wanna be
There's no stopping me

[Bridge]
Everything is possible for me
That's what I believe

[Chorus]
I wanna fly, I wanna be free
Like a butterfly
Gettin' my wings
I wanna run as fast as I can
Don't wanna let anyone hold me back
I wanna fly, I wanna be free
Like a butterfly
Gettin' my wings
I wanna run as fast as I can
Don't wanna let anyone hold me back
I can be anything I wanna be
There's no stopping me
I wanna fly, I wanna be free
Like a butterfly
Gettin' my wings
I wanna run as fast as I can
Don't wanna let anyone hold me back
I can be anything I wanna be
There's no stopping me

[Outro]
There's no stopping me, yeah
(Laughs)

I know (I know)
There will be those days
I wanna hide under my pillow, yeah

And I'm sure (I'm sure)
That the clouds will come
And try to rain on my parade, but

I won't let that get me down
I'll laugh until the sun comes out, 'cause...

Oh you can't hurt this girl
Won't hurt this girl
Not this girl, no
She won't listen to you
And your lies
Can't you see why I'm
Not this girl
Can't like you or myself
What do I know
Need a finish line needing to find
Somewhere to collect my thoughts and
Better myself and try to be
Somewhere better than me

What a shame, I'm not this girl
The one who hides in her own little world
Now there are miles to go
And I'm not that girl, anymore

Not this girl
Anymore
See her come down, through the clouds
I feel like a fool
I ain't got nothing left to give
Nothing to lose

So come on Love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around

Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one

I see them snakes come through the ground
They choke me to the bone
They tie me to their wooden chair
Here are all my songs

So come on Love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around
Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one

The only

Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one

The only one
The only one
The only one
The only one

So come on Love, draw your swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around

The only
Walk On Water

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
God's given me all this, still, I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's — a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
Pectations and meet 'em, but first
The "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' frowned and clowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

Stan

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Love the Way You Lie

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, “Wait!
Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't
Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1]
Gotta get something off of my chest, can I get a witness?
Yeah, I got tattoos all on my skin, but scared of commitment
And I keep saying that I love you, I wish you would listen
I wish you would listen
But there's something missin', mh

[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna have to choose between you or having my freedom
Baby, I don't wanna let go of us or what I believe in
I don't wanna feel like I need to leave, don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
You know that I mean it, mh

[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely, oh oh yeah (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Bridge]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Just one thing that's on my mind)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(Yeah, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)

[Breakdown]
Ahh, if I lose myself
Ahh, yeah
If I give a little more of me
Would I lose myself completely?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Outro]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Oh, ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I give you, if I give you, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me

[Intro]
Uh
Kyuh
Rrrr

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'ma give 'em what they asked for
On my James Brown flow with my afro, uh
Tell 'em meet me in the back though
And they better have my motherfuckin' cash flow
When I'm chillin' out in Houston with the Astros
And they know that I get flyer than an acrobat
They can't see me from the back row, back
I shut it down with my clique though, clack
I know what I don't know
Always pregnant with some sons but I don't show, uh
New York, I'm in SoHo
Gotta hit the UK for some promo, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
On it, I'm not entertained
Me and you are not the same
Bringing it back like Rogaine
Let us do us like romaine
I think I'm insane
I think I'm insane
On it, I'm not entertained
I think I'm insane

[Chorus]
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
Keep trying, baby, good luck
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
Keep trying, baby, good luck

[Verse 2]
Yo, I-I-I know not to doze off
All the boys wanna see me with my clothes off, uh
V.I.P. and it's closed off
Wanna kiss him 'cause his lips look so soft, uh
Gotta tell em hoes hold off
None of them could've did what I pulled off, uh
Doors up when I pulled off
And I been good with that mic like a Bull's court
Why you tryna get up all in it
Do you golf 'cause you tryna put your balls in it?
Uh, I'm just asking a question
Is you driving or is you a pedestrian?
Could I come through your crib with my best friend?
Could I ride that, uh, like equestrians? Uh

[Pre-Chorus]
On it, I'm not entertained
Me and you are not the same
Bringing it back like Rogaine
Let us do us like romaine
I think I'm insane
I think I'm insane
On it, I'm not entertained
I think I'm insane

[Chorus]
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
Keep trying, baby, good luck
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
I know you, I know you, I know you wanna touch
Keep trying, baby, good luck

[Intro]

[Verse]
Everybody goes through it, too
Don't just think its only for you
Upset over what has been done
Don't you blame yourself

Everybody goes through it, too
Don't just think its only for you
Upset over what has been done
Don't you blame yourself

[Outro]
Don't you blame yourself

[News story plays in the background]

Fuck Donald Trump bitch. Yep, yep. Yep, yep. Fuck you.

They should suspend your dumb ass motherfucker all the goofy shit you do every day. When you gon' get suspended motherfucker? Fuck you. I'm with Marshawn Lynch, nigga. Stand up for the Mexican president, Mexican motherfucking national anthem. We fuck with Mexicans, nigga. They the homies. Fuck you bitch.

Fuck you Donald Trump and everything you stand for.

LaVar Ball good looking out. I want to thank that motherfucker, but fuck you. "Should've left him in jail", what kind of nigga is you man?

[Scoffs] Garbage.

America y'all should be ashamed to call this piece of shit your president. He ain't mine. Fuck him.

[Verse 1]
When I wake to the morning sun
Then I sleep when the morning fall
And I bask in the morning's love
'Til I can't feel the love no more
And we see what the day will bring
And we see what's left in store
And we listen to the old birds sing
They cry melodies of love so raw 'cause I...

[Verse 2]
See the night has begun
To explore and try
City vilain number 1
Memory, this night..
Scandalous and crazy
Makes it all worthwhile
Perfume smells like daisies
Now my heart is on trial

[Verse 1]
Like a lonesome stream
I keep running towards a dream
And on trusty road
Getting weary from the load
'Cause they are wasting all their time
Glorifying days behind
'Cause they've been wasting most their days
In rememberance of praise, again

[Chorus]
We're living in the past time, 

[?]
We're living in the past
We're living in the past time, 

[?]
We're living in the past

[Verse 2]
Like the sand upon the shore
Like we've never dreamt before
'Cause it's an evil sight to see
All the things that bring you grief

[Chorus]
We're living in the past time, 

[?]
We're living in the past
We're living in the past time, 

[?]
We're living in the past

[Outro]
We're living in the past time, 

[?]

[Verse 1]
How much longer can I take this
As I know wish for 

[?that scheme?]
All the pain and suffering
Pulling me down deep within

[Chorus]
But I just feel so much grieve
Over love that was so 

[?greed?]

[Verse 2]
At nightime, toss and turn
Oh how this feeling hurts
I've taken too much pain
But I'm the one who 

[?sieve?] the pain

[Chorus]
But I just feel so much grieve
Over love that was so  

[?greed?]

[Bridge]
Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up
Get up, get on up
Get up, up
Get, Get on up

[Chorus]
But I just feel so much grieve
Over love that was so 

[?greed?]

[Chorus]
Imagine, imagine, uh
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine, Imagine, uh

[Verse 2]
What's the point in conflict? Whatcha' tryin'a prove?
Too much confrontation, always against the good
Just like we'll soon turn to haters, unless we change our ways
Avoid all confrontation, to see them brighter days
Too much pointless indifference, just leave it unsaid
Intelligence is intuitive, sent a shock into the head
My love is my soul's imagination
I do love you, yeah

[Chorus]
Imagine, imagine
Imagine, Imagine, uh
Imagine, Ima-ha-gine, yeah
Imagine, Imagine, uh

[Verse 2]
Ask yourself: What is your purpose?
To hide behind reality, yeah, or rise to the surface?
Rise above all of the fraudulent powers
To take back to what is rightfully ours
Control yourselves, let the world around you
Take what it needs to let the love surround you
My love is my soul's imagination
I do love you, yeah

[Chorus]
Imagine, imagine, yeah
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine, Imagine, uh
Imagine, Imagine, yeah
Imagine, imagine, uh
Imagine, imagine, yeah
Imagine, imagine, uh
Imagine, imagine, yeah
Imagine, imagine

[Instrumental Bridge & Outro]

[Verse 1]
I'm just sitting here in my treetop
I'm just swing, swing, swinging away
Feel so magical, feel so loved
Will you catch me on my way down?
I drank your cherry cola
I let you win me over
You're nicer when you're sober
Please just tell me

[Pre-Chorus]
What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?

[Chorus]
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?

[Verse 2]
You chewed my heart and spat it out
Now you're run, run, running away
You didn't pick me off the floor
Will you catch me on my way down?
My pretty mouth is open
My words they keep on flowing
I'm nicer when I'm sober
I'm so sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round?

[Chorus]
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?

[Post-Chorus]
Is it gravity?
Or is it L O V E?
This is gravity
Not L O V E

[Bridge]
I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
I'm not coming down, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here

[Chorus]
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
Is it gravity?

Young hearts run free

[Chorus]
I want to go to the jungle, to the jungle with you
Run from home
Rough and tumble down, down (Go, go to the jungle)
Do you want to go to the jungle? To the jungle with me?
We can be, we can be lions

[Post-Chorus]
Go, go to the jungle, go, go, go to the jungle
Go, go, go to the jungle, go, go, go to the jungle (Hey)
Go, go to the jungle, go, go, go to the jungle

This could be our starting out
Our wild lives
And as the wind blows through your hair
You'll find

Young hearts run free
Running through the bushes, eating kisses made of candy
Young hearts run free
You can drive me crazy, baby, baby

[Chorus]
I want to go to the jungle, to the jungle with you
Run from home
Rough and tumble down, down (Go, go to the jungle)
Do you want to go to the jungle? To the jungle with me?
We can be, we can be lions

[Bridge]
'Cause I can roar like a lion when I'm running through the breeze
Tear it up like a tiger, get you down on your knees (Hey)
'Cause I can roar like a lion when I'm running through the breeze
Tear it up like a tiger, get you down on your knees

[Breakdown]
I can roar like a lion (Go, go, go to the jungle)

Hit the dash, spend a grand at Benihana's (got me faded, oh my God)
Everything designer

Drop the top on the whip for the summer
Just finished this bottle, think I'm 'bout to pop another
Tell the waitress, "Keep 'em comin'" (damn right)
We always turnt up, ho, it's nothing
And tell my old bitch "don't worry who I'm fuckin'" (uh)
Keep the 'rari engine running, hit the gas and I fuckin' blast past
Spillin' champagne out the damn glass
Bitch, I'm stuck (bitch, I'm stuck)
And I'm livin' out in Cali now (bitch)
And, bitch, my life is lavish now (turn up)
Blowin' money and I'm laughin' now (laughin')

[Verse 1]
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone
I'll tell them my religion's you
When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands above my head
Hands together, forgive him before he's dead, because...

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone I'll still be Bloody Mary

We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris, cold
J'veux pas mourir tout seule

I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you
See (see), when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary

Liberaté mi amor

[Verse 1]
Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Bridge]
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

[Chorus]
It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Outro]
Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think
Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
I feel sick and I know I that I'll lose but
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not living if it's not with you)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not living if it's not with you)
I need some real air to breathe
I hate the way they look at me
A part of me is so far away
And I miss that Southern sky

Love took me where you wanted to go
Down a real bad stretch of road
You leave me here most every night
I can't stand this cold

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas

Give me a one-light town
Put me in a front porch swing
Give me a Gold Star in that Texas bar
That's the way it should be

Lord knows how you're gonna end
And I won't let you pull me in
I've spent too long away from what I know

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas

I'm going back to Texas
Take me home
I'm going home, I'm going home
A two-step soothes my broken heart
A fiddle kills the pain
The neon lights, they ease my mind
'Til you come back again

You're gonna tell me that you love me
And make promises you'll break
But until then I'll sit alone
With a honkytonk heartache

Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left

Well that bottle of good whiskey
Couldn't drive you from my head
And it can't erase the memory
Of her there in our bed

Comin' home without you is just
More than I can take
I'm gonna wash down your memory
With this honkytonk heartache
Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left
I'm gonna feel this in the morning, this honkytonk heartache

[Intro]
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1]
You gon' have to face it
Looking like I took the red pill in the Matrix

[?] facelift
Just the way she get it she sees stars in the spaceship
Do my dancin', did a Boonk with Adidas now my face is all up in the Champs
Tell me who I am
Tell me when you say it better say that I'm the fucking man
Into Paris
Will I take the 'Rari or the Wraith or the bands
All my dogs with me and they safe in the France
Ima let them leave unless I'm wasted again, yeah

[Verse 2]
Checks, all I know is checks
Runnin' through the check, cause I'm
Runnin' through the check, cause I'm
Runnin' through the check, cause I'm
Runnin' through the check, cause I'm

[Verse 1]
Well the bedroom lights finally went out for the night
The ringing in my ears from all your bitchin' has finally gone quiet
Can't watch TV for five minutes without the changing the channel again
I'm sick and tired of fightin' over Springer and Rosanne

[Chorus]
I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you

[Verse 2]
You drank all the Keystone and you smoked my last cigarette
Went on a shopping spree at the dollar store, put us a little bit further in debt
The sun came up this morning and I thought about how things have been
Baby, take a good look at this face 'cause you ain't gonna see it again

[Chorus]
'Cause I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you
I want nothing more than less of you
I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been admired by, it's such a fine light
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm growing old

[Verse 1]
I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you
I've got twenty bucks and this road ahead
Plenty of time to clear my head
And I know, I don't need you

[Chorus]
Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time

[Verse 2]
I'm staring down at these white lines
They're taking me further and passing the time
I know, I don't need you
You had one last chance and you threw it away
It don't matter what I've gotta say
And I know, I don't need you

[Chorus]
Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
I know more than I did back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time
Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
I'm gonna toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken

[Outro]
I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you

Snap a cannon with a Canon, no rebel
Gold-diggers couldn't dig it with a shovel (hell no)

[Verse 2]
I got some money comin', throw it in the counters
Me and the homie blowin' money like it's nothing (pap, pap)
Couple aces in my hand, I ain't bluffin'
Top shelf, and the blunt steady puffin' (steady puffin')

When I had nothin', ain't nobody give a shit
Now I got it, wanna fuck with me, huh? (huh?)
Man, fuck off with that bullshit

Hoes used to curve like there was new shit
Now the same hoes in a full-split

Hoes kicking it at the crib, asking Malone

Oh she your best friend cool you can both share

I'm a star, let's get it straight before you start it off!
Hands off, till you give me the keys to the loft
And put a ring on it before I take it off!
This ain't a game I've been the boss
And now for keeping it popping just like my lip gloss
I'm here to floss, I'm here to set it off
And I'll be having you up and down like a seesaw
And what I rock, ain't all I got
And I don't really care what you got unless you got a yacht
Then step it up a notch you better hit the spot
And make me so hot as if I'm taking shots
And I'm the cream of the mutherfucking crop
If you can catch me in the top slot slot
You might see me in the Bentley drop top
With Southern Caly as my backdrop

[Chorus]

She anticipating, she want it, and she want it bad

And so tonight is going down, I'm trying to see your thongs

And when I get home the only thing i'ma hear all night from her is

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & Timbaland]

Think i'm crazy now
You really don't wanna see me explode

Watching every move and i'm waiting to blow
Remember the last time
You begged me to stay when I wanted to go
Now do it again
It's going down like you never seen before cuz

Remember payback's a bitch
You know three's a crowd

[Keri Hilson:]
On the back two steps ahead of me
Pressure time is wasting
Happy boy you'd better be
Trust me it's amazing
But I got it wrong, how you should be with me
I'm stuck in the sea how in need we are
Reach the sky will be touching the moon
But somebody is on the eye but he ain't you
As the lucky lady night lost in the crowd
I said you did you when the lights go down wow

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

[Chorus]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

[Chorus 2]
Someday soon  we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Outro]
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new, I got new
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new, I got new
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I-I-I-I-I-I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him
I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards

Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you

[Outro: Donnis]
What's happening shawty, you know what this is. 

[?] blunts! My boy, what's happening shawty man, you know man. I told y'all I was gonna do this drop for you shawty, but you know I kept procrastinating man and that wasn't the move. I've been busy working on Southern Lights, man, out here in the A-Town but right now I'm out in LA, and I told my fans I was gonna do your motherfucking drop because you're my nigga and shit

[Verse 1]
It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

[Pre-Chorus]
My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

[Verse 2]
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time

[Chorus]
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I

[Intro]
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies

[Verse 1]
Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps
Turning out more and more good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps
Turning out more and more good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through

[Verse 2]
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, take it easy
When he leaves me, please be my guest
To whatever I might've left in his kitchen cupboards
In the back of his bathroom cabinets

[Verse 3]
And oh yes, oh yes, oh yes
There's a dress in the closet
Don't get rid of it, you'd look good in it
I didn't fit in it, it was never mine
It belonged to the ex-wife of another ex of mine
She left it behind with a note, one line, it said
"I don't know if I'm coming across, but I'm really trying"
She was very kind

[Chorus]
Fruit bat
Cuter than a button, mutton-head maniac
Fruit bat
Cuter than a button, mutton-head maniac

[Verse 4]
Nobody can replace anybody else
So it would be a shame to make it a competition
And no love is like any other love
So it would be insane to make a comparison with you

[Verse 5]
Ruminations on the looming effect and the parallax view
And the figure and the form and the revolving door that keeps
Turning out more and more good women like you
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through

[Chorus]
Ooh
Cuter than a button, mutton-head maniac

[Refrain]
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies

[Verse 6]
And no love is like any other love
So it would be insane to make a comparison with you

[Refrain]
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies

[Outro]
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through
Yet another woman to whom I won't get through

Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Verse 1]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—

[Hook]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Bridge]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

House keeping
(Knocking)
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Disculpe!

[Verse 2]
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
You ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas?
On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed"
You ain't try

[Part II: For Sale?]

[Intro: Bilal]
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too

[Hook]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

[Bridge]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this
But I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"

[Hook]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
Hey baby, please don’t be that way
Hey baby, come and make my day

Oh
I must be wrong
Love isn’t dead
It's in these songs

Hey baby, come and make my day
Hey baby, please don’t be that way

No
I must be wrong
Love isn’t dead
It's in these songs

I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby

It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
He said, lack of composure, baby
Carry on

I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby

[Chorus]
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

[Bridge]
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I could sense you doubt me

You don't need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I could sense you doubt me
You don't need to

Promise you
You'll never ever walk alone
(Promise me baby)
You'll never ever walk alone

Girl, come on talk to me
Come on, babe
Tell me all your secrets and what you like
Feel, oh feel the heat in me
Let me share your groove and your fire
Ah girl, I know just where to strike
(Craving)
Cause I know you're craving
The kind of passion my body understands
Sure understands
Girl, I've been saving just for you
Gonna love you hard and so strong, girl
Unlike no one else can

(Chorus)
You'll never ever walk alone
(Oh, you'll never baby)
You'll never ever walk alone
(Come on and take my hand)
You'll never ever walk alone
(Don't you wanna go with me, baby)
You'll never ever walk alone
(And I love you)
You'll never ever
(I love you)
You'll never ever
(You girl, oh you know, I really, really do)
You'll never, never to walk alone
(Understand)
You'll never ever
Every little thing about you

I know your secrets and what you like
Light your fire, I know where to strike
And if you let me love you, baby
Like no one else can
You've got the kind of passion
I sure understand, you

Vamp:
You'll never ever walk alone
(Say, you'll never)
You'll never ever walk alone
(I love you, babe)
You'll never ever walk alone
(Oh, yes I do)
You'll never ever walk alone
(Don't you want to go with me)
You'll never ever
(Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on babe)
You'll never, never, never, never
(Feel me)
You'll never ever
(If you're ever feeling me)
You'll never, never, never, ever
(Trust me baby)
You'll never, never walk alone
Ah, girl, trust me baby
You'll never, never walk alone
La, da, da, la, da, da, la, da, da
Well, well, well, well, well, well, yea
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
(Baby won't you come back)
Whoa, yea
(I can't let you go
Holding 'til you come back)

I'm trying to understand you need your space
A change of pace to grow
And I'm crying
To find another takes my place
Girl, now you let me know
How does it feel
Thought it was me who turned you on, baby
(Turned you on)
Life's been unreal from the time
You've been gone, baby

(Chorus)
Baby won't you come back home
(Baby won't you come back home)
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
Holding 'til you come
Baby won't you come back home
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
I'll keep holding 'til you come back
I'm dying down in my gut
I wanna bust
But I don't let it show
While you're flying
Around this town with him
You're up and down
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Girl, can't you see
With you, I'm satisfied
(Satisfied)
My love is strong and my arms are open wide

(Chorus)
Baby won't you come back home
(Baby won't you come back home)
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
I'll keep holding 'til you come back
Come back home
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
No, no, no
I'll keep holding 'till you come back
No, no, no, girl

Your love's too good, baby
I know you know
Your love is too good, girl
I'll say it again
Your love is too good, girl
Love's too good to turn out bad
I'm thank the lord for what I had
(I'm thankful)
I'm faithful girl and always true
My crime baby is loving you

Come back home
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
I'll keep holding 'til you come back
Come back home well, well, well
Please, girl
I can't let you go, I can't let you go
I'll keep holding 'till you come back
Come home, come home
Well, well, well

What fool said a man ain't supposed to cry
He ain't never had a woman like you to say good bye
Baby, come home, please girl
Oh girl, my girl
I ain't too proud to beg, baby
If it keeps me from going out of my head, baby
Oh, come home, come home girl, come home
This 'ole house, it ain't the same baby
The telephone, it never rings, never rings
So come home, oh girl, please come home
My baby, I'm gonna wait on you
Right here in my rocking chair
Come home, my baby, my baby
I really miss you girl

Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you do
Whatever you say
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy
Wherever you do
Whatever you say
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

[Intro]
You know Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall (what's that?)
The most famous reindeer of all?
(Come on)

[Verse 1]
Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows (come on, come on)
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

[Verse 2]
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say (what's that?)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

[Verse 3]
Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph, the Rednose Reindeer
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in history (now get it)

[Instrumental]
(What's that?)

[Outro]
Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph, the Rednose Reindeer
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in history (forever)
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in histor-
You'll go down in history (now get it)

[Chorus]
Shout it like a stereo, I'm not your stereotype
No I'm not like that, I just want my life back
Shout it like a stereo, I'm not your stereotype
No I'm not like that, I just want my life back

[Verse 1]
See the government and me, and my fantasy's free
We'd spend all our money, on a fantasy tree
Then we'd chop it and we'd chip it
Then we'd turn it to pulp
Then we'd press it and we'd print it, just to give us our wealth

See the government and me, and my fantasy's free
We'd spend all our money, on a fantasy tree
Then we'd chop it and we'd chip it
Then we'd turn it to pulp
Then we'd press it and we'd print it, just to give us our wealth

See the government and me, and my fantasy's free
We'd spend all our money, on a fantasy tree
Then we'd chop it and we'd chip it
Then we'd turn it to pulp
Then we'd press it and we'd print it, just to give us our wealth
See the government and me, and my fantasy's free
We'd spend all our money, on a fantasy tree
Then we'd chop it and we'd chip it
Then we'd turn it to pulp
Then we'd press it and we'd print it, just to give us our wealth

[Chorus]
Shout it like a stereo, I'm not your stereotype
No I'm not like that, I just want my life back
Shout it like a stereo, I'm not your stereotype
No I'm not like that, I just want my life back

[Outro]
A master, keep the mystery
I could be an actor, through the misery
I could be your Yoda, Teach you wizardry
I could teach you yoga, though not literally
And I hope, got that inventory
Could be the teacher...
To infinity
To infinity

[Intro: Tory Lanez & Funkmaster Flex]
Ayo, it's the Sauce Kid official, Tory Lanez
You know I came here to respect all the legends
To show my respect and hop on the Funk Flex, legendary
You know how I always wanted to do this shit
Hot 97, you know how we rockin'
Shout out my nigga True Life, I'm 

[?] in the buildin', you heard?
You know what it is (mm-hm)
Funk Flex, Ciroc Studios, Tory Lanez is here (yeah)
Which is here
I'm thinkin', instrumental is— let's— let's get to it?
Let's— let's— yeah, let's get it
Let's do it ERNZ
Turn it up a little bit
Yeah, uh!

[Verse: Tory Lanez & Funkmaster Flex]
Tory Lanez got the block on whiplash
The cops on draw quick fast so my shit stashed
I keep a big fifth stashed in the whip dash
Trip, catch six in a second like quick flash
Bitch pass if you ain't lettin' the clique smash
I switch tags just so I could let my chicks brag
Niggas whole swag ain't half my chicks bag
No jokes, those'll get you smoked like quick drag
I click fast then bang your bitch ass
Brain from your chick in the whip that I just crashed
Sound wild like Tory puttin' a thou down
Tryna make a bitch bow down in the chow chows
Don't you know I sing songs with a mink on
And have chicks dripping like the sink in their string thong?
I ding dong ditch bitches when the fling gone (ha ha!)
With a mink on and four fingers that my rings on
Quick drawin' like you don't know where my dick going
Like I ain't been up in your chick dome since the flip phones (pow!)
My ice rocky, nice jocky
So much maple leaf money, niggas think I'm playing ice hockey
I'm that fly type, move through the night cocky
Bitch, I look so good, even the dykes watch me
I'm on Dyckman with a bad lightskin
Chain rain so much water they think we 'bout to have lightning
When I spit, niggas think I'm in that lab fightin'
Niggas think that I'm left hooking and I'm jab writin'
One thing is, I ain't in that lab writin', nigga everything is off top
Word to my bald spot
I used to have to stash work in my broad spot
Cops came, had to stash work in her bra strap
Phone calls and my connect is just a call drop
We don't count down on those, that's a ball drop
Come on akh, pretendin' y'all niggas on block
Twin fives put like ten of y'all niggas on shots
We could do it however y'all niggas wan' rock
Make this shit pop like oil in a chrome pot
And it don't stop
I'm not a picture painter but I will put a nigga in his own chalk
I let the .9 spill
I got a ill lil' shooter out in Brownsville down for the wild deal
I'll feel blessed if nigga test and my shooter leave him streched 'til the bones in his spine chill
I'm ill nigga, this is not a time drill
I used to serve on the strip and watch Seinfield
Man, I remember serving on the strip
Watching out for cops hopping out suburbans on the strip
Working on the strip, chilling with a .30 on my hip
Whole team of shooters, bunch of Steph Curries in my clique
Boy, I'm a wild boy, check the style, boy
I'm a real baller, you a towel boy
I'll put 'em in the future, no Elroy
'Cause I pop tops like I'm opening some Altoids
Breath minty and fresh Fendi
Got a hustler chick down to smuggle bricks through the West Indies
I'll hustle 'til it's nothing left in me (woah)
And the plug hear 'bout me and gotta invest in me
I send semi's at any nigga that's testin' me
I'm prayin' to the lord, he's the one that been blessing me
But yo, I got a sick set
And my jewels like dipset
And we on cam like dipset
These fuck niggas say they coming for the kid neck?
Give ya dog shots like I'm checking in a sick pet
Got street ties with the street guys
Even if they fly on G5s, they'll kill you for a G5
Fifteen hunnid, my FN gunning
My dawg copped twenty birds, and they just keep coming
He sold four and plus he let a sick team run 'em
We ain't talking 'bout a verse when it's a sixteen coming, check
I'm a real nigga
I keep a Tommy on my body but when you see me, I ain't wearin' Hilfigher
Just a ladder and a roofer that'll drill niggas
And down to take his own charge when he kill niggas
Look, I'm the hot kid in the school
I pull up to the party and I pop chicks in the pool
Hot chicks say I'm hot and my dick is a jewel
Just let me box with that twat, I'll stick it and move
Yo, she like the way my wrist dance
She like the way the wrists on my fist dance
Every time a nigga switch hands
And my guns and shooters on quickstands (he really goin' in!)
You would thinks the guns designer, they way they come in rip pants
Wrist cuts, my wrist slants and I'm in the truck getting jiggy, tryna get up in your chick pants
Bitch dance
It's four hoes with me, if them four hoes did me, shawty, it won't be a fifth chance
My whole stretch from south France to Brisbane
And they attached to the arms like wrist bands
Look, I send 'em up and I'ma send them niggas back if they sent 'em up
My dawg got a twenty on him and a semi tucked
But, I've been in so many life or death situations, I just wanna live it up
I dropped it off and I picked it up
And my jewels all embedded and I'm feeling six'erd up
I'm in the club tryna find a thick chick to fuck
Man, after all my neck and wrist is all glittered up
Bitches wanna fuck it up, now they want to lick it up
They man hear about it next day and wan' get me touched
In a Bentley, tints tucked, Cuban linked up
Big chain on me in case I gotta get you inked up
Wrink up, see the wrist roller wrinked up
Whole squad looking like we robbed us a Brinks truck
Any cat that know Lanez know I'm worldwide
I leave you on your sweatshirt like Earl died
I'm more wavy than a surfer on a curl tide
And you a bitch, even lookin' from your girl's eyes
I'm a stunna, my wrist done up, my girls got the scar tissue on her tits done up
Fucking with her, I'ma have to lift gun up (mm)
And bang bang 'til the tissue on your hip come up
I'm a all around star player
I'm a lot of y'all father like Darth Vader
Fuck niggas know I charge for my hard labour
I spent nights in that cold for that hard paper
Listen, that's why I feel I'm the most hot in the place
A lot of niggas saying they hot but they not in the place
And your block? It ain't hot, man it's safe
Next nigga diss Tory Lanez 'bout to get shot in his face, nigga
I hate niggas that lie and move funny
That why keep fly and chill on the cruise money
Y'all niggas lose money, y'all niggas just snooze money
Just look at my blood, my shit is just ooze money
Look, I do this for that youngin' on the corner
That hustle all day though he never had a daughter
He never had a father, he hustle in the corner
I'm telling that he wilding tryna truck the shit to Florida
But niggas love to hustle, it's aura
When you come up from the poor, you struggle and you sure
You gon' do it for mother, lost your brother to the force
So you in the only son to keep the loving in the core
Every day you ducking strays tryna run in to the store
And you can't afford a bed, layin' covers on the floor
And you momma's stressing and her blood pressure getting lower
And your daughter want that brand new toy
But it's hard to show her that you broke and can't afford it
(You can tell!)
So you on the corner, niggas talking shit and the plug, he keep avoidin' ya
So you wanna hustle and you tryna get your coin up
Out there on your own, but shit, Satan will corner ya
So you wanna own, tryna get your own up
Now I'm on my own, I'm just tryna get my own up
Had to come through, 54, bought the chrome up
Niggas tried to hate, had to bring back the chrome up
I'm on Funk Flex, ayo fuck everybody that said, "fuck Flex"
I don't care what niggas talk and how they wan' talk
I'm on my thing and my niggas let them things bark
Listen, look, I been this way, I don't care how the fuck I'm coming in this way
I'm with my nigga Ray, my nigga Uno and my nigga GP
Niggas come through, I got them bitches on the CD
They gon' watch me like we on the DVD
I don't give a fuck man, you see me on the TV
And I'm all up in the Champs, and I'm all up in Adidas
I got all the bad bitches, more stripes than a zebra
Niggas hatin' on me, 'cause they see me and I'm gettin'
Fuck around, see me magazine, up all up in the features
Double-X-L they ain't want me on the cover, next year they came around
I fucked around and dubbed 'em
I don't give a fuck, y'all nigga know how I be rocking
Forty fifth on the block, niggas milly rocking (sorry, 

[?])
Ciroc poppin', shout out my nigga French
That French Vanilla is lit and the shit is intense
I had a bad bitches threesomes last night
It was mad riches, all my niggas savages
I come to the block, above the averages
I don't give a fuck, my niggas— ah! Fuck it!
Let's rock, my nigga!

[Outro: Funkmaster Flex & Tory Lanez]
You see us! One take! (Let's rock!)
'Cause you know a lot of you rappers be comin' up here
Don't be doin' one take, I just wanted to bring that up
Don't tighten up 'cause I told the truth
Talkin' about— lemme just say somethin' (what's that?)
I'm doin' this shit for all the people who respect
The classic New York culture
I'm doin' this shit for all... all the young niggas
That—at the— at the end of the day—don't respect this culture
Because I come in and I respect everthing
And I know where the fuck I came from, my nigga
And this is what the fuck I came from
So, I respect all the fuckin' legendary MCs
I do this for niggas like Kiss, Juelz, fuckin' Cass, fuckin' Styles P
Everybody, nigga, y'all know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout!
You know what it is, Funk Flex, Tory Lanez
We here, I mean bought— (lemme put my jacket back on)
You know what I'm sayin'? Real cold after that
Remember I said— remember I said one take
And how you niggas be comin' up here don't be one-takin' it
It's okay! Just wanted to acknowledge that though
Top five!

[Chorus]
The Sun, the sun don't wait for nothing, oh
The Sun, the sun don't wait for nothing, oh

[Verse 1]
Universal existence, play it until it's on the system
Play it until it's on the system, play it until it's on the system
'Cause it hurts in the distance, in the rhythm
Play it until it's on the rhythm, play it until it's on the rhythm, ooh
'Cause I care about the simplest, play it until it's what I'm living
Play it until it's what I'm living, oh, play it until it's what I'm living
Wasn't first on the wish list, this life I'm living
Can I blame it on the sytem? Play it until it's on the rhythm, oh

[Chorus]
The Sun, the sun don't wait for nothing, oh
The Sun, the sun don't wait for nothing, oh

Universal existence, you can feel it, just listen
Soul's from a dreamtime, kissing
African, her mind's blissing, oh
See the sun, He won't wait for something to happen, oh
On the run, 'cause he'd heard you bluffing, and happy
It's begun, yeah, begun to surface like a medicine purpose, oh
Number one priority is show them that we're is that we're worth it, no

[Chorus]
The Sun, the sun don't wait for nothing, oh
The Sun, the sun don't wait for nothing, oh
Oh, oh
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
Killin', I'm killin' these niggas, I'm breaking that news
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
You know Metro higher than a mountain where my dew
Ay, I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes
You know I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes

[Verse 1]
Bumbaclot pass me the rock
Thug life like Pac
32 rounds in that Glock
Bumbaclots, state trooper tried to catch a nigga with the Glock
Tell em mind they business bitch I'm tryna run a shop
Pussy nigga going loose lips so I bought a mop
Anytime they come down at me I get to first like I had to stop
Take me a trip to Colorado to smoke moon rocks
No way, no way, no way she can't leave me
You can't leave me, she's not from Georgia but she a peach

[Hook]
Swag all over my body all on my shoes
Killin', I'm killin' these niggas, I'm breaking that news

Rabbit rabbit bitch I'm jumping like ribbit
And I'm twice as green, ya dig?

You know I got swag all on my motherfucking shoes

[Intro]
(Oooo) Hey!

[Verse 1]
Rocking around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
A mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Chorus]
And you will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

[Verse 2]
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
*Instrumental*

[Bridge]
Rocking around, rocking around

[Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Oh, voices singing, let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

[Verse 3]
Rocking around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

[Verse 2]
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

[Outro]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Intro]

Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you)
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

[Outro]
Baby! With you

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
It’s hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it’s amazing

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know
I'm a prisoner to

[Drop]

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey &The Weeknd]
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)
Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (Out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
Cause I know, all I know, all I know
I'm a prisoner to my

[Drop]

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams

[Intro]
Turn it up a little bit
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Tory Lanez got the block on whiplash
The cops on draw quick fast so my shit stashed
I keep a big fifth stashed in the whip dash
Trip, catch six in a second like quick flash
Bitch pass if you ain't lettin' the clique smash
I switch tags just so I could let my chicks brag
Niggas whole swag ain't half my chicks bag
No jokes, those'll get you smoked like quick drag
I click fast and blang your bitch ass
Brain from your chick in the whip that I just crashed
Sound wow like Tory puttin' a thou down
Tryna make a bitch bow down in the chow chows
Don't you know I sing songs with a mink on
And have chicks dripping like the sink in their string thong?
I ding dong ditch bitches when the fling gone
With a mink on and four fingers that my rings on
Quick drawin' like you don't know where my dick going
Like I ain't been up in your chick dorm since the flip phones
My ice rocky, nice jocky
So much maple leaf money, niggas think I'm playing ice hockey
I'm that fly type, move through the night cocky
Bitch, I look so good, even the dykes watch me
I'm on indictment with a bad lightskin
Chain rain so much water they think we 'bout to have lightning
When I spit, niggas think I'm in that lab fightin'
Niggas think that I'm left hooking and I'm jab writin'
One thing is, I ain't in that lab writin', nigga everything is off top
Word to my bald spot
I used to have to stash work in my broad spot
Cops came, had to stash work in the bra strap
Phone calls and my connect is just a call drop
We don't count down on those, that's a ball drop
Come on akh, pretendin' y'all niggas on block
Twin fives put like ten of y'all niggas on shots
We could do it however y'all niggas wan' rock
Make this shit pop like oil in a chrome pot
And it don't stop
I'm not a picture painter but I will put a nigga in his own chalk
I let the .9 spill
I got a ill lil' shooter out in Brownsville down for the wild deal
I'll feel blessed if nigga test and my shooter leave him streched 'til the bones in his spine chill
I'm ill nigga, this is not a time drill
I used to serve on the strip and watch Seinfield
Man, I remember serving on the strip
Watching out for cops hoping out suburbans on the strip
Working on the strip, chilling with a .30 on my hip
Whole team of shooters, bunch of Steph Curries in my clique
Boy, I'm a wild boy, check the style, boy
I'm a real baller, you a towel boy
I'll put 'em in the future, no Elroy
'Cause I pop tops like I'm opening some Altoids
Breath minty and fresh Fendi
Got a hustler chick down to smuggle bricks through the West Indies
I'll hustle 'til it's nothing left in me, and the plug hear 'bout me and gotta invest in me
I send semi's at any nigga that's testin' me
I'm prayin' to the lord, he's the one that been blessing me
But yo, I got a sick set
And my jewels like dipset
And we on cam like dipset
These fuck niggas say they coming for the kid neck?
Give you dog shots like I'm checking in a sick pet
Got street ties with the street guys
Even if they fly on G5s, they'll kill you for a G5
Fifteen hunnid, my FN gunning
My dawg copped twenty birds, and they just keep coming
He sold four and plus he let a sick team run 'em
We ain't talking 'bout a verse when it's a sixteen coming (check)
I'm a real nigga
I keep a Tommy on my body but when you see me, I ain't wearin' Hilfigher
Just a ladder and a roofer that'll drill niggas
And down to take his charge when he kill niggas
Look, I'm the hot kid in the school
I pull up to the party and I pop chicks in the pool
Hot chicks say I'm hot and my dick is a jewel
Just let me box with that twat, I'll stick it and move
Yo, she like the way my wrist dance
She like the way the wrists on my fist dance
Every time a nigga switch hands
And my guns and shooters on quickstands
You would thinks the guns designer, they way they come in rip pants
Wrist cuts, my wrist slants and I'm in the truck getting jiggy, tryna get up in your chick pants
Bitch dance
It's four hoes with me, if them four hoes did me, shawty, it won't be a fifth chance
My whole stretch from south France to Brisbane
And they attached to the arms like wrist bands
Look, I send 'em up and I'ma send a 

[?] back if they sent 'em up
My dawg got a twenty on him and a semi tucked
But, I've been in so many life or death situations, I just wanna live it up
I dropped it off and I picked it up
And my Joels all Embiided and I'm feeling all sixered up
I'm in the club tryna find a thick chick to fuck
Man, after all my neck and wrist is all glittered up
Bitches wanna fuck it up, now they want to lick it up
They man hear about it next day and wan' get me touched
In a Bentley, tints tucked, Cuban linked up
Big chain on me in case I gotta get you inked up
Wrink up, see the wrist roller wrinked up
Whole squad looking like we robbed us a Brink's truck
Any cat that know Lanez know I'm worldwide
I leave you on your sweatshirt like Earl died
I'm more wavy than a surfer on a curl tide
And you a bitch, even lookin' from your girl's eyes
I'm a stunna, my wrist done up, my girls got the scar tissue on her tits done up
Fucking with her, I'ma have to lift gun up and bang bang 'til the tissue on your hip come up
I'm a all around star player
I'm a lot of y'all father like Darth Vader
Fuck niggas know I charge for my hard labour
I spent nights in that cold for that hard paper
Listen, that's why I feel I'm the most hot in the place
A lot of niggas saying they hot but they not in the place
And your block? It ain't hot, man it's safe
Next nigga diss Tory Lanez 'bout to get shot in his face, nigga
I hate niggas that lie and move funny
That why keep fly and chill on the cruise money
Y'all niggas lose money, y'all niggas just snooze money
Just look at my blood, my shit is just ooze money
Look, I do this for that youngin' on the corner
That hustle all day though he never had a daughter
He never had a father, he hustle in the corner
I'm telling that he wilding tryna truck the shit to Florida
But niggas love to hustle, it's aura
When you come up from the poor, you struggle and you short
You gon' do it for mother, lost your brother to the force
So you in the only son to keep the loving in the core
Every day you ducking strays tryna run in to the store
And you can't afford a bed, layin' covers on the floor
And you momma's stressing and her blood pressure getting lower
And your daughter want that brand new toy
But it's hard to show her that you broke and can't afford it
So you on the corner, niggas talking shit and the plug, he keep avoidin' ya
So you wanna hustle and you tryna get your coin up
Out there on your own, but shit, Satan will corner ya
So you wanna own, tryna get your own up
Now I'm on my own, I'm just tryna get my own up
Had to come through, 54, bought the chrome up
Niggas tried to hate, had to bring back the chrome up
I'm on Funk Flex, ay yo fuck everybody that said, "fuck Flex"
I don't care what niggas talk and how they wan' talk
I'm on my thing and my niggas let them things bark
Listen, look, I been this way, I don't care how the fuck I'm coming in this way
I'm with my nigga Ray, my nigga Uno and my nigga GP
Niggas come through, I got them bitches on the CD
They gon' watch me like we on the DVD
I don't give a fuck man, you see me on the TV
And I'm all up in the Champs, and I'm all up in Adidas
I got all the bad bitches, more stripes than a zebra
Niggas hatin' on me, 'cause they see me and I'm gettin'-
Fuck around, see me magazine, up all up in the features
XXL ain't want me on the cover, next year they came around
I fucked around and dubbed 'em
I don't give a fuck, y'all nigga know how I be rocking
Forty fifth on the block, niggas milly rocking
Ciroc poppin', shout out my nigga French
That French Vanilla is lit and the shit is intense
I had a bad bitches threesomes last night
It was mad riches, all my niggas savages
I come to the block, above the averages
I don't give a fuck, my niggas

[Chorus]
Favorite holiday
Made my costume for halloween
Favorite holiday
Made my costume for halloween

[Verse 1]
But I know
Someone's going to out do me
And steal the show
The girl I like is wondering where's Waldo
Robin Hood shot me in the leg
With his bow and arrow

[Chorus]
Favorite holiday
Made my costume for halloween
Favorite holiday
Made my costume for halloween

[Verse 2]
Waiting for the keg
But the blues brothers
Made it float
Beetlejuice keeps playing
Death metal on the stereo
Frankenstein monster mashed me
Across the dance floor
Now I wanna go home

[Chorus]
Favorite holiday
Made my costume for halloween
Favorite holiday
Made my costume for halloween

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh

Who don't wanna play?
I'm drop topping in these foreigns on off these southern dames
Playing games, I'ma fuck it
Ima brain Jay coppin plus chain chains swinging, singing songs Bad bitches hittin' bones switching, lanes
Niggas, chain thicker than my dang bang
Nigga, let that semi hang
Nigga, I be all up in the house, I want everything nigga
First time, she let me even hang with 'em look
Still gettin' paper off the block
Gotta take it off the top, used to scrape it off the block, uh
Young Fargo, you know a nigga flying over the border like I just missed cargo
Baby, you know, smoking on the 5-0
Got them bad bitches rolling but I'm ducking all the 5-0s, uh
And I'm fucking 'bout nine hoes
Got these bitches moaning like Alonzo

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope

[Verse 2: Audio Push]
I feel like I'm on dope when I ain't wit' you (bounce bounce)
I need to hear my dope when I miss you
I'm stackin' paper like magazine issues
It's always an issue I can't commit, but you know everything I do is official
So you don't press nothin'
I hit the studio I tell Aminé to press buttons
Niggas know those checks comin'
I make her rock the boat like game-X
She fuckin' me cuz I'm famous
Killin' every beat until I leave the game stretched
I feel like I'm on dope
She wanna get high
If you tryna smoke
Then get up in the ride
Cuz it's lit at every show
There's women on side
But I don't ever go
But she want it tonight
So it's going down
I'ma let you know it now flyest nigga doin' it
And what I say go so she ridin' if I'm coolin'
If I'm chillin' in my section assuming you need direction
Finessing, forever on that next like a Jetson

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope

[Verse 3: Anthony Danza]
Uh, I'm high like hello
Stuck like the seatbelt
Put me in the hot seat
I'ma make the seat melt
Young entrepreneurial
Countin' money, eatin' cereal
My glass is so full point of view is so aeriel
My peanut butter leather
With that peanut butter sweater
I can't believe it's not butter
It's just a little better
No vendetta, you bitches is so forgettable
Forget 'em and get 'em a boat
K to they burial
Geometry gold ropes and heavy links
It's big bricks small circles let's not overthink
Surrounded by these sundresses
Flat-screen T.V.s, V.V.S.s
And brand new B.B.S.s
Addicted to the Mormon eyes, pretty lips
Caprisun with the molly, who wan' take a sip
Unc cuz you know the drill, you know the scale, gonna make it tip
Soft serve everything, dairy queen, everything dip

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope, uh

[Outro]
Young nigga feelin' like he on dope
Gimme more, gimme more

Blowin' dope, blowin' dope
Young niggas movin' dope you know how it go
Get at me
And when I say dope I mean types yo' kush

[Verse]
And I'm too high up to ever miss her
She a stupid little bitch, she think I'ma kiss her (Ayy)
Young rich nigga, I don't drink no liquor
And I ball real hard like a 76er
And my middle finger up 'cause I don't fuck with niggas
And my black bitch look like a rolled cigar (Uh!)
Stomp him in his eye like the light from Pixar (Hoo!)
Some praise God, some praise at the Buddah
I disturb the peace like my nickname was Luda (Ha!)
All my bitches older, all my bitches be cougars
Chopper by my side while I pop at the sicko
Model girls are pretty but I rather a thick ho
Dick got her aching, and she gon' think that she sick, woah
Always keep it loaded in case a nigga tell me get low (uh!)

[Outro]
Get low, hell nah I can't get low (Woah!)
Get low, hell nah I can't get low (Woah!)
Hell nah, hell nah, I can't get low (no!)
Woah (Woah!)

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up
I go to parties with strangers, so I can figure it out
Run through a city at midnight to feel like a star
I want it all, even if it's fake

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (Told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
I know I'm wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

[Verse 2: Carly Rae Jepsen]
I'm wide awake, lyin' next to him, and feel it all
I got a thirst for distraction that I can't take back
My fingers run through his hair
I'm grippin' at regrets
I put my mouth on his lips to taste

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (Told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
All that went wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so I turn it up

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Carly Rae Jepsen]
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop

Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

She's headed for the big time, that means

Oh!
There's no Wi-Fi in forest

No mirrors nearby, but I see a better reflection
I was fucked by the nature, we didn't use protection
Made a lot of trees, they are now in a book section
No cameras, no lights, but a lot of action (flash)
Yeah, summer turnin' winter
C'mon, little mama Jackson (wooh, woooooh)
Flow like water (swim, swim)
No Beats by Dre, but beats by your father

Switch it up, bipolar

Got an angel, got me real closer
Running it just like a halo, yeah
Never let me go, never let me go, no
Want a little more

Wind it up and then we fast-forward
Leave a message, hit record on ya

Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you mess it up
I'll self-destruct

The way you look at me
I-I-I short circuit
You make me lose control
It's automatic
You push my buttons
See-e-e-e how I work it
I-I-I-I get what I want
Like it or not

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I-I get what I want
Like it or not

[Verse 3: Mykki Blanco]
Ghost in a shell
I'm a beast in the sheets
I'm a neutron bomb-bomb, blowin' the beat
Gonna spray that raygun and fall to his knees
I'm a lightnin' rod, I'ma bite that bod
Do you want a femmebot or do you want a ho-bot?
Slut-bot, fuck no, systems down
Boy, I'll clone you, boy, I'll swerve you
Glitch your mainframe, now I own you
Ex Machina-na-na, you can't win
I'm A.I. fly, I am that bitch
Is your love for real though?
I'm Trinity, you're Neo
I'm bionic, not ironic
Super Saiyan, supersonic
Hard drive crash, you don't remember
Charli bit yo wittle finga

[Bridge: Dorian Electra]
I'll be your femmebot
Girl, I'll be your femmebot, can never turn me off
I'll be, I'll be your femme-

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
The way you look at me
I-I-I short circuit
You make me lose control
It's automatic
You push my buttons
See-e-e-e how I work it
I-I-I-I get what I want
Like it or not

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I'll be your femmebot
I-I get what I want
Like it or not

Got a couple of bitches that want my attention
They actin' real vicious, but I'm not offended
They lurkin' like witnesses, money I'm gettin'
Could drop an ice tray and I still won't be slippin'
(Got) Another check comin' in
(Got) A couple checks I ain't spend
(Got) Fat pockets, need a gym
(I) Made it possible like Kim
Today, I got great times
Square it out like FaceTime
Yellow tape around the body
But not measurin' waistlines (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Zero fucks, the amount (What?)
Zero bucks in your account (You broke!)
So many offers on the table (What?)
A bitch gotta eat on the couch

You pushed everyone away but
My mausoleum, pretty like Versailles
Man, I played it out 'bout a thousand times, yeah

You pushed everyone away, oh
Tell your new lover to enjoy the ride
Pop the Chardonnay, kiss her lips goodbye, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: MØ]
You won't hear my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong

Right down to where I fall apart
Wish me luck, wish me luck
Drive through the night
Head on your shoulder
But I miss you so much
So, so much

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Try to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Verse 2: Caroline Polachek & Charli XCX]
Used to be 5 star, yeah
Golden, golden
When I had nothing, you gave me silhouette dreams and
We made them real, somethin' like freedom
I killed the lights, went crazy
Throwin' all the china all around the kitchen
I kicked the ladder under you
Playin' dumb, shut tight, that ain't love, no
That ain't love

[Chorus: Caroline Polachek]
Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
I tried to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX & Caroline Polachek]
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face

Sitting all alone again
Here I find myself alone again
But I don't know what it is
Do I push people away
Or am I shy?
Maybe I'm shy

Sitting all by myself
All I've got is me and my good health
But I want more
Something real
That'll feel like more than run of the mill
Run of the mill

Sitting all alone again
Here I find myself alone again
But I don't know what it is
Do I push people away
Or am I shy?
Maybe I'm shy
Sitting all by myself
All I've got is me and my good health
But I want more
Something real
That'll feel like more than run of the mill

More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill

I want a love that's more than run of the mill

Applying pressure to your chest (Your chest)
I beat 'em with the royal flush (Royal flush)
My main bitch she one of one (One of one)
I swear she nothing like the rest (No)
I caught her right on Bouldercrest (Bouldercrest)
Yeah, I took lil' shawty off the bus (Facts, facts)

[Chorus]
Ooh ah, ah
I just want whatever you got, that belongs to me
And all I can do is whine
Oh, whine!
I hope God could stop what you shot... to me (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
New G Wagon, 24s on that bitch (Ayy)
I made two of the rappers pee they clothes, prolly shit
I made two of these actress fuck my whole fucking clique, ayy
Blue cheese wrappers sitting on motherfucking slicks
Let's take a Percocet test, I prolly fail that bitch (Mmh)
I think my old lady on to us, I got to mail that bitch, ooh ooh
I got a whole lotta cheese, yeah, yeah, Velveeta rich (Velveeta), ooh ooh
I got fans all over the world, I make 'em all moshpit (Hmph)
And if that nigga play crazy in the school, I'ma make his ass turn into the wall
I got all these niggas' old ladies tryna pay attention so they can know how I ball, ball, ball (Ayy)
You should try by God, the car was never driving it (Never)
You should try by God, the bottle was never popping it (Ooh)
You should try a whole lotta things, yeah (Yeah)
You should try losing somethings, gotta go to the property
Everybody YSL, a lot of properties (Slime)
Everybody parasail like a Nautica (Slime)
Everybody with me pockets end up wobbling (Wobbling)
Irv Gotti
Everybody with me, they ain't scared to catch a body (Nah)
Everybody girl running 'round with everybody (Yeah)
Everybody came around me, start getting money (Money)
Everybody came around you, start taking molly (Hah)
You see the difference (Yeah)
They whole picture penny pinching (Hah), they dead broke
They ain't really dead, they just living (Facts), expert
I'm balling and I'm still in business (Facts), make her squirt
All in the motherfucking kitchen

[Chorus]
Ooh ah, ah
I just want whatever you got, that belongs to me
And all I can do is whine
Oh, whine!
I hope God should stop what you shot... to me (Jeffery)

[Verse 3]
You can't stop what God got for me
I said, "I'ma stop," and drunk more codeine (Lean)
Pop that mini label that ain't ecstasy (Label)
And I'm telling on myself but I don't care about a thing (Fuck it)
It's funny now I'm rich that I don't care about money (Woah)
Before I was married, man, I still didn't care about honeys (Hah)
Speaking of honey, yeah, I'm a big B honey (Big)
Go tell your ex-boyfriend he can't see me or nothing (Nothing)
He can be my neighbor, still can't see me (Hey)
His album is the latest, still can't be me (Hah)
And don't you talk to me 'bout nothing (Nothing)
Every one of my watches come in flooded (Yeah)
Every one of these thotties, I coulda fucked, yeah (Yeah)
Diamonds on me, got the robbers rushing (Facts)
My attitude out' space, I don't care 'bout nothing (Facts)
Pack the Smith & Wesson (Grah)
Actavis let go of me leg, oh (Hey)
Actually me bankroll, don't let go (Don't let go)
Ready to run you rap niggas back home (Ready)
Put a Tec-9 into the backbone (Tec-9)
Money give you goosebumps, money give you feedback
Sweat on your tee top, I don't wanna see none of y'all
Y'all are cheaters, fuck your mamacita
Yeah, I'm a nasty bastard, I need a detox
Yeah, I'm in a foreign whip with your mamacita
Ten thousand dollar chips and a hunnid visas
And I got a lot of sticks and a hunnid creatures
Better not have no bad bitch if you wanna sleep with her (Wait)
Get a pack, nigga you better rollie pollie ollie (Hey)
Came up in the projects with no roaches (Hah)
We had to keep it clean, everything smelt soapy
Back when we had no homies

[Chorus]
Ooh ah, ah
I just want whatever you got, that belongs to me
And all I can do is whine
Oh, whine!
I hope God should stop what you shot... to me

[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, uh (Haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City, uh
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause…

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (Bitch)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (Bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like—

[Chorus: PHresher]
—throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
River (Ooh), river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Part I]

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty ‘cause we're black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Damn, girl
Do I drive you crazy?
You make me crazy, too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
’Cause you remind me of myself

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Verse: Alice and the Glass Lake]
I've drowned and high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything I'll grasp by ends or what's left over
And the lights in every broken blown-out window
Screaming, laughing
I like to feel it coursing out
This is our revival

[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes 'cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all—

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all—

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (And actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (Things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I’m confused
Because—

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got… thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn’t mean
The words that we meant that we didn’t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda led to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin’ still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself—

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade & Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder!

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I’m the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrassed, I don’t want no one else to see
’Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
But somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "Screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 1]
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 3]
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For 

[edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see ...

[Chorus]
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world’s on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we’re never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin’ me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I’m simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn’t scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just—

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin’ in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (Golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (What we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (So we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (Golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (What we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is—

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (So we're…)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (Don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a… no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (Golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (What we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Intro: John C. Reilly]
Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: "I gotta meet her" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (Word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
"Letter" come to me—"mail." "Sweater", "heat," "some degree."  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said—

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (Duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl
Your body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it—

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg & John C. Reilly]
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Outro: Eminem & Mark Wahlberg]
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description, ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like, "Oh my God, he's trippin'!"
Only time you get the blade is
Probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing
I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby
A lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blond fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And Senator Mitch McConnell’s
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—
Shit's on, bruh! (Ha-ha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 2: Eminem & Paul Rosenberg]
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam
On nanny cam, I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys
In the Caddy armrest, I'm imaginin' objects
So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck
Got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)
Grow up?
Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins
Like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (Em…)
So's my manager
Bitch, I amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me—
'Cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific
So smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway
I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been makin' wedding plans all day

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a 10, you’re an eight (Urinate)
Like what I do before, after, and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest
And find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder (R. Kelly with a full bladder)
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me
In some holy water, with some floaties on
And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me
While you hose me off and, nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained
Dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (Uh-huh)
I get why you're tapped
"But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back!"
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie
When life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad:
Don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders
Belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (Sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (At his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (Attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage (Minimum wage)
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this, I can simply because I can

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 1: P!nk]
You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 2: P!nk & Eminem]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I
Leave you for good and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you—what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm—

[Chorus: P!nk]
I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Intro: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just died, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

[Chorus: The Cranberries (Eminem)]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my—

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we’re alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you’ll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
Uhh, December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, I’ma make it if it kills me
Let’s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (Ha!)
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can fuel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad’s crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup (Haha)

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle (Mm)
Now we are trapped on the throne (Uhh, shit)
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
Ahem, alright, let's see
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad–shit, I don't know

[The sound of a bottle of pills being opened is heard. Eminem ingests them and collapses over the floor]

[Part I: Arose]
If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite—wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things—time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

[Part II: Castle Extended]
(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'—now I know
(*Toilet flush*)

[Verse 1]:
Yesterday I learned to fly
Showed my wings to everyone
I got careless in the sky
Flying too close to the sun and I went...
Down, down, down
I went down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Yesterday I took a fall
Realised I coulda died
Didn't hurt myself at all
Just an issue with my pride and I went...
Down, down, down
I said don't let yourself get too proud
I went down, down, down
Guess that I've come to terms with it now

[Chorus]:
(Oh) I just don't wanna loose you
(Oh) I just don't wanna loose you
(Oh) I just want us all to have a good time

[Verse 2]:
Mom and dad I hit the ground
It was like a blinding light
Gravity is still around
Even when you're taking flight and you'll go...
Down, down, down
I said don't let yourself get too proud
I went down, down, down
Guess that I've come to terms with it now

[Chorus]:
(Oh) I just don't wanna loose you
(Oh) I just don't wanna loose you
(Oh) I just want us all to have a good time

[Bridge]:
If you're here then shout;
"Who's that guy up in the clouds?"
Guess he'll turn around
I might need you 

[?]
'Cause I'm coming down...
And I came down, down, down
Way to be here on the ground
Say you want me now
So I can fly

[Chorus]:
(Oh) I just don't wanna loose you
(Oh) I just don't wanna loose you
(Oh) I just want us all to have a good time

[Outro]:
A good, good time!

[Intro]
R-R-Rad

[Verse 1]
Wish I could swallow up this feeling
So far, the ground won't touch my feet
And I know, your lips and mine should never meet

[Pre-Chorus]
Something you say, got stuck in my head
You shift the stars, then we broke the bed
Spring turn to summer, that's when you went
But I reckon that you think of me (Woo!)

[Chorus]
When you go-o-o-o-o (I fall apart when you—)
When you go-o-o-o-o (I go to war when you—)
When you go-o-o-o-o (Lonely nights, when I ain't with you)
I reckon that you think of me (Ow!)

[Verse 2]
I tried to live outside the moment (Hey)
But the feel of your touch, it touches me
And I know, your lips and mine should never meet
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Something you say (Ooh), got stuck in my head (My head)
You shift the stars (Stars), then we broke the bed (Bed)
Spring turn to summer, that's when you went
But I reckon that you'll wait for me

[Chorus]
When you go-o-o-o-o (Niggas be stressin')
When you go-o-o-o-o (All of my hittas)
When you go-o-o-o-o (So empty, yeah)
I reckon that you think of me

[Bridge]
When you go, go, go (When you go)
Girl, you go, go, go (When you go)
When you go, when you go
Where you go, go, go?
I reckon that, reckon that
Where you go? Where you go?
I reckon that you wanna be there

[Chorus]
When you go-o-o-o-o
When you go-o-o-o-o
When you go-o-o-o-o (Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah)
I reckon that you think of me

[Outro]
When you go
When you go
When you go, ooh
When you go
We go, we go
Oh woah
We will not make it, not without you
We will not make it, not without you
We will not make it, not without you
We will not make it, not without you
We will not make it, not without you
We will not make it, not without you

[Verse 1]
Can I ever love again?
Can I ever love again?
Can I ever love again like we did in the meadow?
I've been ready for today, you're just a drop or two away
Let my body rise, so you can play tricks with my mind

[Chorus]
I keep thinking too much, you're not thinking enough
(Can you help me? Can you help me?)
You got a funny way of tricking my memories
(Take it from me! Oh, take it from me!)
Cause it only takes my shadow to put me on the floor
(With my lady)
Let the clouds part further little baby and show me what I've waited for

[Verse 2]
As my mind drifts closer to the water
When will you appear?
I've been waiting all day long
For you to come sit over here

[Chorus]
The night work has been keepin' me hollow
(Can you help me? Can you help me?)
Oh yeah, I pray for solace but they're fresh out till tomorrow
(Follow me down! Oh, follow me down!)
You got my place it's as thin as the walls and the ceiling
(Can you help me? Can you help me?)
Ah girl, I live so simple, such a glorified feeling
(Follow me down! Oh, follow me down!)

[Outro]
Cause yes, it's all on time
I hear him weaving through the trees in the wind
As he watches over me and sings
(Yeah it sings!)
Yeah it sings
(Yeah it sings!)
Oh, it's singin
I look up
(I look up!)
All my pain's just brought me closer to fear
(To my fear!)
Give me a couple words to ring in my ear
(In my ear!)
In my ear
(In my ear!)
In my ear

[Verse 1]
Love won't call like it used to do
Vows take tolls, harnessing a new approach
Anchors born, now they have to stay
Learning curve, trusting in laissez-faire
Not yet in a nightmare

[Chorus]
Tear ducts overworked
Languished senses through the night
Love lost sanctity
Impatient youth

[Verse 2]
Years don't stop with the aftershock
Time feels robbed, never meant to go this long
Verses told them both that the goal is permanent
Choices made when they were too young, now it's not fair
Matrimony nightmare

[Chorus]
Tear ducts overworked
Languished senses through the night
Love lost sanctity
Impatient youth

[Bridge]
Vows take tolls
Love let go
New approach
Nothing is laissez-faire
Forever
Forever
Forever
Swear it's not a nightmare
Matrimony nightmare

[Outro]
Running its course (Grow apart)
Languished senses through the night
Love lost sanctity
Impatient youth

[Intro]
Shock flash!

[Verse 1]
Make their city crumble, and the people- send 'em home!
Secret backdoor motive!
First, dictate with fervor
Use the word of God for your endeavor
Don't show rotting children from the flash kiss of your bomb

[Chorus]
And again, our patriot trends
Focus the fear on differences
Businessmen, true politicians
They know the dead will not confess

[Verse 2]
Don't encourage thinking
That's for us to do
Tell them what they're scared of
Then provide the proof

[Hook]
Learn it, love it, own it, sell it
Shock flash!

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't show burning bodies if the lending hand is yours

[Chorus]
And again, our patriot trends will
Focus the fear on differences
Businessmen, true politicians
We play a rule and they're all sold

[Bridge]
Slow burn
Quick cleanse of the killing fashion
Done internally
So we beg for their protection
"And they all sin, so they need God"
That's the faux concern that we will give
Send our men (send our men)
And hide the fraud (to hide the fraud)
Now that's the secret war we need to win

Now that's the secret war we need to win
That's the secret war we need to win
That's the secret war we need to win
Show the threat is growing
Spreading, violent
Trending, trending, trending
Angst
Faux
Faux
Terrorizing elements

[Hook]
We see a shock event
It sets the precedent
(Timing)
What happens next?
Terrorizing elements

What we see is a shock event
That will set the precedent
(Faux)
For what will happen next
Terrorizing elements

[Outro]
Learn it, love it, own it, sell it

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (The night, my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I'll take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)
Yeah, in the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Outro]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch
A real-ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? (Grow it like a real)
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?  (Grow it like a real)
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch  (Grow it like a real)
A real-ass bitch, bitch (Grow it like a real)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
My niggas taking over
BROCKHAMPTON, call your momma
My niggas goin' platinum
Break necks, send you to the doctor

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection, mm
Did me wrong like a perfect stepson, mm
Been a wrong, you can change the song, hon

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
Who got me riled up?
Who the lame-ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooh, come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me, ugh
Come get it from me
Ugh, ugh, ugh, come get it from me

[Verse 5: Joba]
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters

[Verse 6: Merlyn Wood]
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
And all sudden, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
And all sudden, everybody wanna suck my willy

[Verse 7: Dom McLennon]
They be like, "What the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the fader when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right like you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top-shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that zoom if you just assume

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like

[Video Outro: Dom McLennon]
MERLYN!

[Verse 1: Joba]
Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well—well...
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the wood
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Sunsets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in transforming

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-cyl'
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, ugh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two-liter, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aww
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman, boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft-shell tacos
Got down to pennies and ramen noodles
Now, I see how hunger make a shooter
Stamina, stamina
I used to be holding the camera
Head hit the glass, dog your window up
Fans praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana
She twerkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-uh
She can't kick it, she so Bella
Confused erections
Bad hoes know name brands, they brainless

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
When I imagine myself on acid
I taste the Backwoods and find those 'til I piss off
Even dance and pounce around
My silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't—Don't—Don't—Don't let life pass yourself
When I imagine myself on acid
I taste the Backwoods and find those 'til I piss off
Even dance and pounce around
My silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't—Don't—Don't—Don't let life pass yourself

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I could've got a job at McDonald's, but I like curly fries
That's a metaphor for my life, and I like taller guys
Could've got a deal if I wanted, but I like owning shit
And I like making shit, and I like selling it

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Could've peaked when I was in high school, but I had bigger plans
Could've took the time out to find you, but you ain't understand
You don't gotta leave for them to define you, 'cause what could you demand?
When everybody out to define you without a circumstance

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Anybody got Harry Styles' phone number?
Okay, I called him, and they said I got the wrong number
I was tryna be Pac when I was younger, dreaming of better days
I don't see my mom no more, remind me of bad weather days

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
If you got a problem with me, try some other guy
I let you know I'm a dog, I eat the cat alive
But really, though, I'm alone, 'cause I don't stick around
And yes, I know it's my fault, so put your finger down

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
I would keep this shit pent up if it weren't for my mom
If it weren't for Dijon
Yeah, I don't like to lie, guess it sounds out the months
Should've opened up my mouth more, show 'em what my fist for
Let 'em get a fistful, caught up in the lust, man
Bred from the legs of straight killers on best end
Black eyes, bloody sheets, damn, where yo' feet stand?
We should get a new plan, maybe some more fans

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again

[Verse 6: Joba]
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
My life ain't been the same since my dog died
Since my girl left
I quit drinking and drugging and still can't get ahead
Been at a loss for words
It seems I'm destined to fall apart when I'm depressed
It's all a test, scream at God from my bedside
I glue my hands together, life's got me hog-tied
There's no applause in the game of life, I just bought a car
And a new house, here's the cost to prove it
I spin a little wheel when I'm feelin' moody
And that's like all the time, try not to mind the clock
Because my heart is ticking, I smoke a pack a day and
I wish I didn't, having some trouble quittin'
I have a couple vices, we had that show on Viceland
I was hardly in it; most the time, I'm hidden
Anxious, impatient and always wanting something different
I hate the way I'm feeling, I'm sick of chasing feelings

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I grew up all alone, my mom and dad fighting
I moved around a lot, I did a lot of fighting
I met my friend Ian, I seen a lot of cyphers
I did a lot of writing

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon & Kevin Abstract]
Watch my uncles duck indictments
I'm used to ramen noodles, victims of mental illness
Products of neighborhoods with broken souls and wounded spirits
Don't judge me by appearance, I moved to California
Started getting paid, (Nigga, you broke) shit's already boring

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Dash into the money like a hyphen, fuck a pipe dream, man
Had this shit when I was in my diapers
Burnin' through my diapers, hot shit, that was hot shit
Back when niggas looking for the Loch Ness

[Verse 4: Matt Champion & Dom McLennon]
Stuck 'round dip spittin' assholes, make they mamas bashful
Got holes in my pockets so my shoes full of cash though
Cigar, Fidel Castro, car full of Castrol
See the sunset when I backstroke, can't swim, but I could act, though

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends, ayy
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
Ayy, ayy, imagine having no friends, man

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Meryln! Hopping out the vehicle, I feel like Batman
Hanging with directors, 'bout that action
So please don't stick-and-move in my direction
All I got to lose is my erection

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Matt Champion]
I'm a Black man with a deadly weapon
(What drug reference, huh?)
I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been tripping on the steps, and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still, I'm suffocating

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Carnival, my heart like a Supreme Phantom
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ayy, ayy
Daddy cracking redrum, blueprint for the pipeline
Going out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, tailored just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect, on my back, oh, man, they killing me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
White burner, black burner, I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage, so don't try to insinuate
Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant; when you do the most, it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices

[Verse 5: Kevin Abstract]
America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix, and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, what goes all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit, so Billy 'bout to air 'em out

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
(Wha-wha, aqua, for my)

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said, "Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?"
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me, "Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?"
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Bridge: Joba]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

[Outro: bearface & Ryan Beatty]
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I used to work for people
I made a couple hundred dollars, wasn't worth it even
I'm worth a hundred thousand
Not dollars but diamonds, I am mud out the bayou
Rip a page out the Bible, come and crucify me
I'm a long way from home and this ain't Yellowstone
I trade a white bitch for catfish and yellow bones
This from the catacombs, this for the broken homes
From the south side of cities where my granny home
I moved to California, I bring a Grammy home
I call up bill collectors, "leave my fucking family 'lone"
We left the corner store on the way to caviar
The coupe is mustard colored, what the fuck is Grey Poupon?

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Young K.A., never quit your day job, uh
I bring the love to work, I need the day off, uh
I need the 

[censored], this hard work should pay off, uh
The lights stay off until my mind is made up, uh
A young Zuckerberg, I wake up and make stuff, uh
These niggas copy us, they really need to pay us, uh
I'm from the city where your neighbors fight back
You talking shit, we bring that work right to your lap
I love my niggas like white people love rap
We make the shit you'll probably never say on track again

[Breakdown: Joba]
Walked through doors all my life, just to close them
Tore down walls all my life, here's to the other side
A whole new life
(Feeling the brand new feeling, feeling the brand new feeling)
A whole new life
(Feeling the brand new feeling, feeling the brand new feeling)
A whole new life
(New feeling, brand new feeling, brand new feeling)
A whole new life
(New feeling, brand new feeling, brand new)
(brand new, brand new)

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
(A whole new life)
Back when I was hustling, ain't get no love from them (uh)
(A whole new life)
I paid my own bills and came up with the illest shit (uh)
(A whole new life)
I was tryna find a way to get my family out of it (uh)
(A whole new life)
Spent my days in basements tryna write a motherfuckin' hit
Nowadays he's stumbling, they show such love to him
I shut it down to every show, we set the precedent
I'm just tryna show these niggas, life is on some other shit
Keep your head high, smile when the trouble rumblin'

[Break]

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I don't do what they say, it's unorthodox
Like bears sharing porridge inside with Goldilocks
Like Ozzy with no Sharon, he just called his parents
So fuck what I'm doing and fuck these damn critics
You should think for yourself, that shit is cancerous
Get my head rubbed by fingers of fuckin' hand models
Middle finger, fuck the hair up at all our concerts
Maybe if I cared less, I'd wear a hair net
But now my eyes, ten million by twenty five
Dropped out of Lone Star, booked flight from Lone Star
Was working a couple jobs and quit, became a star, uh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now,  that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Do you see what you contribute to my consciousness?
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break what's monotonous

[Verse 2: Joba]
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight-track I stole from my grandmama

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic
But instead I'm always babbling
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend
Every tour is like a catfish
Just kidding, I love you assholes

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Verse 4: Joba]
It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know where the party at)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)
I just wanna know, know (I just wanna know when we leavin', boo)
I just wanna know, know (24/7 thinkin' 'bout you)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

[Part 1: SISTER]

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
Drink of the apple pie with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Joba]
I've got 

[censored], but you would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counseling, flipping off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilizers
But when I came off 'em, I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted, which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Interlude: Robert Ontenient]
Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir haciendo esto
Ojalá pudiera rendirme pero tengo que seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on Innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I see you peekin’ through bushes
And tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us boomin'
Like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky-lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust, baby, I’ll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk, bitch
Still sittin' on your ass, waitin' for a handout
Giving nothin', put your hands down
"Ooh, yeah, this for the culture!"
"Ooh, yeah, this important!"
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep your mouth where the money at

[Bridge: Dom McLennon]
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is heal you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred  bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

[Part 2: NATION]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I hate them quiet suburbs; I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation; first thing they called me: "nigga"
I fight, I got suspended; my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on—
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second-guessing my decisions, Black bodies come up missing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would float, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost
All the love in my life that I just lost
All the strength, persevering above all
In the lies of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes of my own, I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes that I own, I ain't start yet, I ain't start yet

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Power, African power!
Power, African power!
Power, African power!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
Ugh, I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (my nigga)
Keep 'em right there, oh, you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I want a love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay
When it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin'
Where you went through the chart
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to shed
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted, to recognize who is there, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the road sign on the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooh)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
And I will show you off for everything I own
I know it's not what you're used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the wrong side of the 45
Only you and me by the borderline (ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah (ooo-ooo)
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I spent like a year and a half on the Greyhound bus
On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand-new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over

[Interlude: Ashlan Grey]
Y'all motherfuckers made three albums, still talking about the same shit. The one gay, the one selling drugs, the one that's, uh, tryna act like Lil Wayne. What the fuck is this shit, man? Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip. When y'all enter my whip, y'all better not play this shit, 'cause this gon' go right the fuck off

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like, "Where y'all get it from?"
Rehab poppin' like when Amy had the single out
Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up
Talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'til the sun up, ayy
Hopefully, we get our funds up, ayy
And if I didn't know y'all, maybe I would have a desk job
Ticking 'til I off myself...

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Used to drive around for some hours (Oh-oh)
Used to get paid by the hour (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (Yeah)
Used to drive around for some hours (Oh-oh)
Circle round the block for some hours (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (Yeah)

[Chorus: Joba]
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I’ve been tryna avoid from before I was born
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle I saw on the wharf
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me, and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself, goddamn

[Chorus: Joba]
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute (Ooh), I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it baby
Be there any minute (Ooh), I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby

[PART 1: EVANIE]

[Verse: bearface]
Evanie
Did you lie to him since you were seventeen?
How's he holding up?
Evanie
Do you cling to him like you would onto me?
Bet he needs you more than I
Evanie
Did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels
Evanie
Every chance you take, you make me want to flee
Can't you see?

[Chorus: bearface]
You should move on
I swear you'll be fine
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And when you're alone
And his love is gone
Maybe you'll see that your company
Was the worst thing for him
Your sin

[PART 2: TEAM]

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract, Ameer Vann]
Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
'Cause my president was Black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt-trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola, ah—
(Gimme that mic, nigga)
I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits, ain't no—
Ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms (Hahaha!)
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up (Shut up, nigga!)
They throw me in the crowd and tell me, "Boy, I'd lose that smile"
But see, I got it from my dad, and that's the reason why we had
I raise my Black fist, I got big lips
I'm strong as Samson, they cut my fucking locks
I lose my fucking strength

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Fuck, I'm running out of zips
My life been feeling tense, I won't be on the fence
I put my phone on Airplane Mode 'cause I'm on autopilot
I need a lot of patience, I need a lot of silence

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I hope this holy water burn because I ain't worth this life
I ain't worth the light of day, but for some, I light the way
Nude along the banister, kitchen smell of lavender
Swimming in my Wranglers, I am another caliber

[Outro: bearface]
Ooh, yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Soon, no no, no no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, ooh
Soon, come on
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, ooh
No

[Intro to "HEAT" begins]
Let go of the ones who hurt you
Let go of the ones you outgrow
Let go of the words they hurl your way
as you’re walking out the door
The only thing cut and dry
In this hedge-maze life
Is the fact that their words will cut
but your tears will dry

They don’t tell you this when you are young
You can’t hold on to everything
Can’t show up for everyone
You pick your poison
Or your cure
Phone numbers you know by heart
And the ones you don’t answer any more

Hold on to the faint recognition in
the eye of a stranger
As it catches you in its lustrous net
How quickly we become intertwined
How wonderful it is to forget
All the times your intuition failed you
But it hasn’t killed you yet
Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight
swims and your blazing self-respect
And if you drive the roads of this town
Ones you’ve gone down so many times before
Flashback to all the times
Life nearly ran you off the road
But tonight your hand is steady
Suddenly you’ll know
The trick to holding on
Was all that letting go

[Intro: KRS-One]
Yo you ain't got to do this man
I know times get hard but...
This is crazy man

[Hook: KRS-One]
Come on now, give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
You don't wanna do that son
Give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
You don't really wanna do that now
Give me the gun

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Come on now, give me the gat
What you doing? What you move? What you living like that?
Give me that back in fact you ain't living like that
Come on now, give me the gat
You don't wanna sit in the sack, give me the gat

[?] clean up your act, that's where the change is at
Put down the gat, I know where you at
Come on, don't overreact
Come on now, give me the gun
You an adult now, you gotta start living like one
Like if you an emcee, you can't wait for me man
You gotta start spitting like one
Hit like one, shoot the gift and uplift and keep a spliff lit like one
Get that son, and don't forget that one
Come on man now, give me the gun

[Hook: KRS-One]
Come on now, give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
You don't wanna do that son
Give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
You don't wanna do that son
Give me the gun, you don't wanna do that son
Give me the gun, you don't wanna do that son

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Come on now, easy mon
You don't want neighbor to be see you mon
You ain't not peeped upon
Older son, it's time now to be a man
Give me your hand, let me hear your plan
Let me get you up and down, now you're ready for jam
You can be a whole different mon, a man
Living in a whole different plahn, a plan
My man, my man, give me your hand
Take the time off or put your feet in the sand
Bad times hooking you man
Just another way to see it if you really looking my man
Are you look-look looking my man
Or are you in the world of lookbook looking again?
Drowning, frowning, looking to sin
Yo man I ain't gonna say it again

[Hook: KRS-One]
Come on now, give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
You ain't gotta do that son
Give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
Come on now, give me the gun
Your life is something son
Give me the gun, you don't wanna do that son
Give me the gun, come on now, give me the gun

[Verse 3: Raphi]
Give you the gun, yeah right, why should I?
Had enough of this life, how could I?
Live another day, live it away
It's all display, come on now really, why would I?
It ain't working man, I'm worthless
I'm a good guy gone berserk
And nobody cares, everyone's smirking

[?] for me and my girlfriend

[?] my girlfriend
It's better this way like veterans say
The world just don't deserve him
Final curtain, yeah you heard him
Never hurt that no one will miss me
I did them 

[?] but they diss me
Respect never cut the check so I did my dirt tryin' to get filthy
For feeling guilty, choking on two feet of milky
But that's just how Cali build me
Move on with a new song tryin' to make it, will he?
The clever kid never did
I readily weathered it moving the subject and predicate willfully
Doing it skillfully, kept it real but it never made a mil for me
Paid the bills? Yeah right, man it made more
And it wasn't what I came up in the game for
Big Shame became one of my name
Whether money ever coming to me 

[?] open the door
But I'm tired of knocking, on my last option
I'm stopping, never got it popping
So it's no longer fun
I got my gun, I'm done

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
(4 million people out of work right now!)
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(Half the youth population out of work right now!)
Give me another day
(Homelessness rising up on families!)
So I can try to find my way
(Word up, homelessness!)
And I work (several resumes on e-mail)
And I work (CDs I'm selling my beats)
And I work (part-time at the retail)
And I work (I'm just about to be in the street)
And I work (the cars that I'm driving around)
And I work (will I ever be on my feet again?)
Oh, what we all gon' tell them?
Oh, we telling them this now

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Frankly I don't see how
You can't see how you really homeless now
When the emergency hits, who really holds you down?
With the state of the economy and the way that it is
Many men are at the door with they wife and they kids
Saying

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
(4 million people out of work right now!)
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(Half the youth population out of work right now!)
Give me another day
(Homelessness rising up on families!)
So I can try to find my way (Oh!)
And I work (try to drive a taxi cab)
And I work (enrolled in a technical school)
And I work (my friends, my family for a loan)
And I work (dollar cabs and carpools)
And I work (just another day now)
And I work (I'm getting paid now)
Oh, what we all gon' tell them?
Oh, we telling them this now

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Everywhere across the nation
More people are joining the homeless population
From the south to the north to the west to the east
People can't pay their mortgage or their lease
And last but not least, you better hear what I'm saying
So many men are at the door with they kids saying

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(blow blow blow blow blow! Not getting mercy!)
Give me another day
(4 million people out of work right now! You gotta do something!)
So I can try to find my way (

[?] watch this!)

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
We on the brink of revolution, you let it get too hot
So many people tryin' to hang on and just can not
They must've forgot last night's news spot
Read like a news murder plot starring who got shot
And very uplifting, just who got knocked
Very little giving, everybody's heart is locked
And they call this a civilization
Where I can't even find work with proper employment qualifications
Hip-hop is the name of my nation
Where every day is Saturday and twelve months is vacation
Peace love unity having fun
You can tell by now I'm not the average one

[Verse 4: Triune]
Get choked for the dough, get stabbed for the stash
My actions brash, I rap for grabbing the cash
They search for the blacklist faces
So no need checking your ethnicity on applications
High class for the green
How the fuck I make thirty grand a year with Dukes holding a Master's degree?
It makes no sense so I make those cents
Using my mind and using a nine, break bread
The move not orderly until those political figures meet a nigga over Martin Normandy
'Til then a nigga gon' count his stacks
Shoot craps and crack niggas for countless acts
This a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm Triuno, some call me a great one
Until Bush knee deep in my community
I'm hustling for mine 'til I get an opportunity

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
Give me another day
So I can try to find my way

[Intro: KRS-One]
Feel this, a new experience
And your approach to the lyrics
To the beats and the rhymes
KRS

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
After 19 years of rocking, how do you rank me?
Poorly or greatly? I'm no Johnny-Come-Lately
It's the people that pays me
G-O-D is what raised me
To think that you could blaze me, you must be more than crazy
Radio is Fugazi, XM satellite plays me
Criticism don't faze me, being rich don't amaze me
These princely rappers, they gettin' parked like Paisley
I'm two times the effects like Scoop and Crazy Drazy
I know that no man out there could save me
So I save myself with knowledge of self and 

[?] that God gave me
No coulda shoulda or maybe
I'm in 2024 with the adult version of your baby
The path of life is so wavy, you can not be lazy
Or mindless like a ship sailing eternal gravy
Through hip-hop we speak so plainly
So let's unite and sail through life as a navy

[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)

[?] freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)

[?] freedom (yeah, living)

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
All these people looking at me
Walking with me, staring at me
This is how we work, flash film glaring at me
Little children very happy, I'm signing books CDs
Now I'm signing t-shirts, and yeah my hair stay nappy
Living giving advice on living your life
Oh no, you don't have to be stopped
I'm talking walking working
Inserting energy for certain, not an average person
Temple of hip-hop to hold the over boulder
Money folder for soldier, big up Tony Toker
I don't bridge or poker, not a sauna soaker but come on over
Let's make a plan to get free as we can
Cruisin' the span of this land 

[?] in a new range rover
Get out the city my friend, they have no pity my friend
The way we treat each other is silly, my friend
When you consider the millions of men and women and children
We gotta raise the quality of living

[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)

[?] freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)

[?] freedom (yeah, living)

[Verse 3: Ishues]
Music don't make me, I make it then make it
Make sense, don't it?
And if it don't, you should spend some more contemplation on it
Moments of time spent honing my rhymes
Sent from only the divine, my purpose is mine
And mine alone to define despite your prospective vision
Or skeptic criticism or messed-up definition
I'm a servant of God, don't ever mistake it
And your fate for all that faking, you can never escape it
I'm faceless and raceless, my message is ageless
I'm within all faces the same like with hatred
The Matrix was fake but how they make it so tight?
It's a Mahalia Jackson, imitations of life

[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)

[?] freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)

[?] freedom (yeah, living)

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
In the hearts of the people you could see my face
Cause at any club they know how I leave the place
(How you leavin' em?) Sweaty yet ready reaching higher for more
My purpose is to inspire the poor
So I fire it raw, the others be out for fame
Yet Knowledge Reigns Supreme, that's a household name
(They is hot!) I doubt they gain
I'm true school like Kurtis, I'll blow out they flame (and they know it!)
They may say the crown, they can hold it
But when I'm in the spot, they dare not show it
Cause they're not poets, exactly that
All they rap for is lust and them platinum plaques
KRS comes after that
This that masterful emcee, I'm from a blast masterful cat
Holding a class in the back
It's obviously I mastered rap, I'm blasting 'em back

[Hook: Triune]
I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
My whole life is different, high school I skipped it
Right around fifteen I knew that I was gifted
Self-taught home school specific
Simplistic, my characteristic holistic, a mystic
Everything to me is encrypted
Imbued with the same wind energy that be flowing from my spirit
Those that have ears to hear, hear it
There's no excuse if there's a free library and you don't go near it
Me I seek the truth, others they fear it
They living in the mansions, I'm living in the spirit
That negativity, I will clear it
That productivity, I will share it with all who will hear it
You see now that I exist and can never be told
That hip-hop was about silver and gold
With the mic I hold or held
I try to elevate beyond whatever soul or cell
Yo I sound odd but you know about that camel
That needle the rich man in the kingdom of God
Bring the real, many bring the façade
Them bells in your head, yeah I'm ringing them hard

[Hook: Triune]
I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
Operation defacement, face it
Perfect word placement chase it, wait
Catch one incident of intimate images and word
Get comfortable, a ton of bull is held at bay
Keep your ear to the street, peep footsoldier and I told you
When mixtape hit the street, it's curb and concrete
Beat beast, heat feast, don't speak, hold heat
Holy though he better let it
Better get it offer I'm taking position
Young listen
Nice as five high-speed chase to ditch cases
Cali give it three strikes, I might give you four
Bars to get it right, I check the mic in the floor
You ain't bold enough to hold enough
Flow ain't cold enough
Fool I sho nuff showed up to blow that show up
Shoulderin' a brain quicker than DSL modems
When I touch down, I raid your town

[Hook: Triune]
I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

[Intro]
On God, Dedication 6
On God, Dedication 6
On God, yeah

[Chorus]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

[Verse]
You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no cordial shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that "Who is this?" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky; blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp— "Hello, who is this?" I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, "What other line?"
She like, "Never mind," and she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy, y'all can't trick me
She said "God, forgive me"
I say "Nah, I'm busy"

[Bridge]
I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

[Chorus]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)

[Outro]
Six shit, on God
Dedication 6 on God
Dedication 6 on God
That's some sick shit
Oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Dedication 6 yes Lord

I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no

I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back

Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I...

[Pre-Chorus]

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
(Don't let him in, don't let him in - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Don't be his friend, don't be his friend - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I gotta tell them to myself
(Don't let him in, don't let him in - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Don't be his friend, don't be his friend - don't, don't, don't, don't...)
I gotta tell them to myself
The best song telling you not to listen to others

Those I’ll Provide
Wilco

All my life
You told me I couldn’t write
Think about it and tell me
Why you can’t deny

You’re maligned
And all you do is want to connive
So, don’t mind the answers;
Those I’ll provide

Remember kinship
And the longing that prevailed;
All I did was tell you was tell you
That you’re plans had been derailed
You were resigned
To leave those answers behind
Well, don’t mind the answers
Those, I’ll provide
You’re maligned, when you say, “I got the answers.”
You, tell me the questions

Driving down to the great unknown
I would have felt a lot better
If I knew who had come along

I felt so perfect
Then again, sublime
So, don’t mind the answers;
Those I’ll provide
Well, don’t mind the answers;
Those I’ll provide

Ludacris got a remix, finna go low
Hold up, let me get my camera

Minnesota, and the women in Louisiana
D.C., VA, Motor City to the Lou', what it do?
Finna blow like Waco Chi-town goin' way low
Both Cakalakas, Alabama to the M-I-Yayo
New York, California
Philly and they really put it on me when I'm down in Texas
Album numero siete get ready for the battle of the sexes, I'm restless
Tryna tell 'em that I'm hotter than the burn in the 3rd de- gree, gree
Then I try to tell 'em ain't nobody in the world as hot as- me! me!
If you really goin' low, you gotta go- hard
Go lower than the grades on yo' reports- card
God! Ludacris, I'm the best that ever did it- did it
And when it comes to the money I'm like, "don't stop, get it! get it!"
Whooo!!

So work a pole like street promo
We pay cineveo, we big show
Bring it down on the ground if you really down
Tell me now (How low can you go)
Yea, low like an 808 drop
Lower than the chrome on a 88' box
Low like I'm in the seat when I see cops
Lower than a cinnamon in a

Spread it out like a peacock
She's hot let me watch like D shock
I heard they call it that sweet spot
Well I'm hip-hop, baby want a beat box (Uh-ah-uh-ah)
Breath, that's a good way to start
A ain't a motherfuck around like me
That'll spend 10 G's inside a Walmart
I wouldn't give a bitch 50 cent
But I'll give a bitch 50's art
Have a baby by me baby, live in a trailer park
How low, can you go?

Lower than a limbo stick
Lower than the bottom of a bottomless pit
Now get your ass up on the floor
Go ahead and drop that shit
And whenever they put our album out
Go ahead and cop that quick
'Cause ain't nobody else in the game
Who's makin' the ladies rock like this
Everybody 

[?]
Makin'

Sexy girls

The Virgin Islands and me make them girls get down and freak something
So low that it almost looks as if they underneath something
How low can you go? PTFAO
When the club to the girls in the hood rock
City got the street buzzin'

And you were mine

[Verse 2]
I'll pass it off
As long as I can

You out of my head

I'm all alone
Inside this room
My body is weak
And it wants you

I'll try to make
The most of it
But something is wrong...

Oh

Oh here we go again
It's my fault

[Outro]
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

[Verse 1: Dizzy]
You already know
Gangsta music, you know how the gangsters do it
Bangers, exlcusive
Shankers and uzis
I got Maine in the booth
Wayne in the booth
Money on my mind, that mean I'm thinking of loot

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Shit, ain't it the truth
Money is the top prio-
"Money Over Murder," that's the title of my bio
We cop drops like it's part of the policy
This hardbody, baby, y'all softer than wallabies
So hush puppies, let the big dogs ride
Don't jump on that field when it's kickoff time

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
And I, fresher than the Frebreeze bottle
Coming at the shit full throttle
And I power ball like lotto
Do it with my eyes closed
You niggas is all soft, soft shell tacos

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
And eyes go deeper than pot holes
For that money, bet I'm running like a snot nose
No Kleenex
Dark shades, V-necks
Bitch, I ain't playing no recess
We reps YM, baby, that's that shit
And it's fuck the world like a nasty bitch

[Verse 5: Dizzy]
Fuck raps, I bust caps for snaps
I fuck white, I fuck blacks, I fuck Japs
Now what's hap?
I make stacks, ASAP
I take that from the safe and I replace that

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Stay strapped
I stay low, stay back
The judge handing out L's like Pat Sajak
And I'm all about my team like an apex
Make you niggas turn your seats into a Playtex

[Verse 7: Curren$y]
Yes, member of a fly society
Style, I got several varieties
As a child, this guy memorized "Scarface" in it's entirety
The 80s drug era inspired me
That's why I dress how I dress, walk how I walk
That's why I rep what I rep, talk how I talk
Two rope chains, both of them gold
With a gloat like I just came home

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
Flow touching the pedal in that F-5 yellow
Just moving through the city like blood in the vessel
I'm a fucking professional, so intellectual
It's Mr. Fat Stacks, my pockets got high cholesterol
I need vegetables, is weed vegetables?
I'm past commas, right now I'm seeing decimals

[Verse 9: Curren$y]
Step to you, the opposite of my environment
Out of all the dogs in the yard, I was the quietest
I had a little bark, I had a little bite
Was surrounded by niggas who snap and don't think twice
To kidnap your enemies, dress them up as Santa Claus and drop their bodies down their mamas' chimneys
Water to your kidneys
My class G like the Bendz G

[Verse 10: Mack Maine]
My truck waving and my rims speak
I got burners on my rear seat
See, I don't say too much, so if talking becomes part of the ballgame, money talk for me, yeah, my ends speak
Yeah, what you expect? I'm from the Hollygrove area
Where we see more redskins than Steve Spurrier
We know the clock ticking, so we planning hurry up offense
Hustling on the park bench, caution

[Verse 11: Lil Wayne]
The major bison of the boulevard
The barracuda, fighting off the fish and raw
Yeah, I get around like a business car
And you can see me everywhere but the prison yard
I'm on that sissy hard, and that kush tough
Weezy stay high, just look up

[Outro: Curren$y]
Shook up like a can of Coca-Cola that fell down five flights of stairs, man
Can't hide that you niggas so scared, man
Ahead of my time, I'm the already-there man

[Verse 1]
When they lay me down to rest every night
Signs dressed and bright
Pointing to the sky
That's where I'll be when I close my little eyes
Drifting side to side
With my mind open wide
And I know that these things just aren't real
As perfect as they feel
I'm content with this unreal dark world

[Chorus]
But I know that it's not behind these dream lens
Where she comes and greets me almost every night
But I know that it's not behind these dream lens
Where she comes and greets me almost every night

[Verse 2]
When her arms come up and rest upon my neck
And her lips purse to a peck
Who is this girl I see at night?
I may never see her once
I awake, so no chances I will take
I'll sleep until I can't no more

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now the day has come and I'm on my own
The girl is still unknown
I hope to see her when I sleep
Now the day has come and I'm on my own
The girl is still unknown
I hope to see her when I sleep

[Verse 1]
Testing auras I detect
Feeling us connect
Decimation, medication fix
‘Cause I gotta try to shake this off
Mental moat rocks the boat of progress

[Verse 2]
What do you do every chance you get?
Call me on my shit
Overstate it, meditated tricks
Leading tone!

[Hook]
In the moment you see red
In the mirror I see dread

[Chorus]
Then I get it, that I’m invested
I’m the culprit and I resent it
(Detach!)
Social defect
I detest it
(Keeping distance!)
So I’m staying alone

[Verse 3]
Brief interaction
Is ideally the way that I choose for it to stay
Quick dissolution
If the stated rule above is threatened

[Verse 4]
Wait, am I who I want to be?
I don’t say half of what I mean
Could I see my name on your grave?
Am I wrong to feel it out that way?

[Bridge]
Oil in water
See, what comes next defines the context
Oh… I just don't know!
I just... I really like the way that things have landed!

[Hook]
I hate it when you call me on my shit
In the moment you see red
I see dread

[Chorus]
Then I get it, that I’m invested
I’m the culprit and I resent it
(Detach!)
Social defect
I detest it
(Keeping distance!)
So I’m staying alone
Alone

[Chorus]
Firin' at niggas, I'm firin' at niggas

I feel like Malcolm X I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside
I'm coming out firin' at niggas, firin' at niggas
I hear sirens, I'm firin', I'm firin' at niggas
I'm like Malcolm X, I'm peepin' out the blinds
Don't care if it's nine hundred niggas outside

[Verse 1]
Bow, bow, bow

Nigga run up on me, I'ma back his ass down
I'ma stand up, nigga, I will never lay down
I bad place by the cartel, they gon' knock us head down

[Verse 2]
Boston, George Diego flow, my bitch like Griselda though
Thousand pounds of yellow dough
Rich ass junkie, full of money
Cameras watchin' every door
Ten mill in an envelope
Banana boat with telescope
I count 2 mil on Periscope
Duplex is exceptional, burglar bars protect the door
Draco on the floor, and AR-15 on the sectional
And young nigga with plenty dough
I done hit so many hoes
Eenie menie minie hoe, I always use protection though
My Smith and Wesson teach a lesson what you call your brother for?
You ain't even special ho, why you gettin' all extra for
Why that nigga pull up to my truck actin' aggressive for?
I bless you I don't stress you, if it's pressure then it's pressure (grra)

The word around town is this nigga six months (huh?)
She ain't really pretty, she just Instagram stuntin'
Proper-talkin', bitch

[Hook]
A nigga got pregnant, he was dickridin' so much
The word around town is this nigga six months (huh?)
She ain't really pretty, she just Instagram stuntin'
Fake proper-talkin', bitch be like "Please pass the Backwood" (what?)
Trap boy Jack, I get the pack and run it back
What they say 'bout Guwop, stop the track, shit, run it back
Big bro was a good boy, he sacked the quarterback
But I was just a hood-boy, bricks in my culdesac (brick)

[Verse]
Jordan number five, Gucci man, I'm still alive (whoa)
Domino, vamanos, pull up with a pie (domo)
Middle finger with the five, fuck the GBI (fuck 'em)

Matty with the eye, call me Patty with the pies (Patty)
I'm comin' ov', on the stove, look like I'm whippin' rocks (skrrt)
Fuck her lookin in her eye, then I tell a lie
I'm leaving now, don't tell her why, I just tell her "Bye" (bye)
Club full of side-hoes, givin' the side-eye (side)
Pull up murk the parkin' lot, call it a drive-by (grrah)
She tired of the small-fry, she want the big guy (Gucci)
It's a lot of niggas snitchin', lot of niggas tellin' lies (liar)

Brrr
Guwop

[Verse 1]
A casualty of war
Tijuana cartel man, they killed him in the car
He think he invincible, think he above the law
Gun'll drip, designer down, I'll merk you in the mall
Now Ahki got that purple chop, he still pray to Allah
Most of you rappers pussy now, they need to wear a bra
Carefree stare, she lick me down, I skeet all in her jaw
Thot bitch she so groupie, now she slurped it in the mall
My quickshot don't settle in her jaw
Wedding cake 800 pounds, I'm tryna serve you all
Behind the wall, they locked me down, my back against the wall
You think you switch up on me while, but mother-fuck you all

[Hook]
Niggas trynna buy my style, but it ain't in the mall
My bitch act so boujee, now she don't even like the mall
My closet designer down, that shit look like a mall (s'Gucci)
That shit look like a mall
Niggas trynna buy my style, but it ain't in the mall
My bitch act so boujee, now she don't even like the mall (mwah)
My closet designer down, that shit look like a mall (Guwop)
That shit look like a mall

[Verse 2]
Niggas actin' ignorant, crazy and belligerent
Plug up the ticket, an' ain't nobody diggin' it
Ain't nobody kickin' it, louder niggas switchin' it
Plugs cuttin' heads off, arteries and ligaments
If you owe 'em fifty cent, in a bad predicament
The gon' bust your head bout them green dead presidents
Wipin' down the evidence, shooters at my residence
All this water 'round, it got me high, I think its heaven-sent
Doors, really kickin' it, the woes, really sendin' it
Cash, I be spendin' it, an' packs, I'm really shippin' it
A hundred bricks of three came in, an' I can see it vividly
Drop-top like J.F. Kennedy

[Hook]
Niggas trynna buy my style, but it ain't in the mall
My bitch act so boujee, now she don't even like the mall
My closet designer down, that shit look like a mall (s'Gucci)

Southside on the track, yeah
Gato

[Verse]
I pop a whatchya-ma-call-it, but it got side-effects
Dick rock-hard like a math test
Hit it from the side, that's a side-effect
I'm a Zone 6 nigga, now you're my bitch
Slurpin' up the drank and it got side-effects
Shit expensive, bitch, you thirsty like a cactus
Tried to DM a bad bitch, but he got catfished
Doin' editin', turns out she's just a fat bitch
Trynna keep her with the 'Wop, but it got side-effects
He filin' bankrupted, turned up on the internet
He lease the Wraith, he deficient on his taxes
Thought he was trappin', where the cash at, you stashed it
I'm El Gato, front door, but it got side-effects
My dope defy the laws of science, I'm a scientist
I put a key in my rerock machine and press it
It came from Tijuana but I had to skretch it
Cartel affiliations, man, they come with' side-effects
I'm talkin' pull up to the plug in a private jet
I'm talkin' numbers so low, it got me cheesin'
Blowin' money like trees, Big Meechin'
I'm droppin' good game on your big peaches
I just scope-tracked the trailer, free reefer
Side-effects strike first, Grim Reaper
Desert Eagle, four-five, street-sweeper
Like Gucci really see dead people
I mean really man, I see dead people
Body found, don't make it a sequel
Side-effect, me an' you are not equal
Growin' up, I did shit so evil
Yesterday, half a mil' for two features
Niggas warin' in the streets, we ain't equal
If I get caught, I see no evil
A side-effect, I bought a brick and two Beepers
How you snitchin' on a nigga that feed you?
A side-effect, get rich, they turn evil
Is that a car, is that a plane? No, that's a creature
Guwop

[Outro]

[Intro]
Huh, Gato
Alias, Wizop, Gato, huh?

[Chorus]
Thick, young, tender
She ain't no PYT
She ain't ever had a nigga like me
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
She got a bust-down Rollie like me (burr, burr, burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be
Thick, young, tender
She ain't ever met a nigga like me
Nah, never meet a nigga like me (Gato)
Get nasty as you wanna be

Sugar daddy got so much cheese (wow)
Pusha man I push so much piece (burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm, showin' out, that lil' hair done growed out
Guwop 808 just dropped and I threw up the whole knot
Stove top, smokin' hot, been scrapin' this pot a whole lot
In Magic City parkin' lot, I threw up the whole profit
Old prophet, told you shit 'bout first you even heard 'bout it
Rock salad, ten bricks in a day, she not worried 'bout it
Big money, Gucci Mane, I know you freak hoes heard 'bout me
So much money, so much sauce, I might try dress everybody
Gucci poppin', I don't want it if I ain't the first to cop
Top droppin', window tinted darkly so she not stoppin'
Ho poppin', she so turnt your ho tried take my ho shoppin'
Legs lockin' 'cause I'm tryna fuck her like the feds watchin'

[Chorus]
Thick, young, tender
She ain't no PYT
She ain't ever had a nigga like me

Sugar daddy got so much heat (wow)
Pusha man I push so much piece (burr)
Get nasty as you wanna be

[Verse 2]
Gettin' money in the club, and she know
See the dope man, ho, she know
And her old man used to sell dope
All her exes done moved kilos
She a thick young tender, she grown
I'm the plug, only thing she know
Over 21, she way past grown
And her booty got so so swole
Titties just got done, they swole
She a fool, how she work that pole
So thick, make a nigga look backwards
Leave marks on her neck like Dracula
To a kingpin, money don't matter
If he want it, then he come and get at her
She fuckin' her way up the ladder
That ass gettin' fatter and fatter

[Chorus]
Thick, young, tender
She ain't no PYT
She ain't ever had a nigga like me

Get nasty as you wanna be

Big rose gold Frank Muller, my watch conceited
I gave her a few dollars, she fine she need it
But don't call back, hoe fall back, bitch don't be greedy

Just bust down a duo, they drunk they sleazy
Good suck up got fucked up, they sleep we leaving

Wiped the plug nose, gesundheit
If it's on sight then I'm green lighting
If there's gun fighting then there's no typing
Homicide bodies, little kids cryin'
Bodies flying, they duckin', what the hell is they shootin'
Paradise is like Vietnam, what the hell is we doing
Sun Valley like Lebanon, Famgoon lil Pakistan
If a nigga wants the point of 

[?] and give the drummer some
I'm on a marijuanathon, I'm on a marijuan-on-one
Who want smoke I wanna sell you some
Track the trail another metric ton
Grade A it's excellent, honor roll no cap and gown
I'm with Gucci gang but I ain't Lil Pump
This ain't a lil pump this a big drum
Didn't join the band I never went to prom
East Atlanta slum wop I'm one-of-one
I'm with Southside, he run the mafia
You hear the 808s them the crazy guns

[Hook]
Wipe the plug nose, call me Kleenex
Finessed him with the load, he drunk he sea sick
Bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch just hurled, fucked up my V-neck
Wipe the plug nose, they call me Kleenex
Finessed him with that load, he drunk he sea sick
Just bust down my Hublot, I'm drunk I'm sea sick
Lil thot bitch just hurled, fucked up my V-neck

Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
It got me smiling like it's diamonds in my mouth
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Cause it's a drought but I'm not never running out
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Marijuana war I'll burn your crop down
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
I'm stashing bricks and pounds, the drought I'll bring 'em out

[Verse 1]
Ever since that shootout I've been shot out ever since
No cash for the holiday he looking for a lick
Country boy a tourist say he looking for a brick
He must think this a movie now he tied up in the 6
Ever since that murder I've been shot out ever since
Shot at me and missed they let me go that self defence
El Gato, Chapo call him having him tryin' to jump the fence
Shooters all up from me told 'em burn 'em with the stick
I thought if I got 20 mil that I would go legit
Soon as I got that 20 mil I bought a thousand bricks
Bought my bitch a dog named Dollar, Gucci richy-rich
Tailored in that Steve Harvey, homie you the weakest snitch

[Hook]
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
It got me smiling like it's diamonds in my mouth
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Cause it's a drought but I'm not ever running out
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Marijuana war I'll burn your crop down
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
I'm stashing bricks and pounds, the drought I'll bring 'em out

[Verse 2]
Bullets break your vertebrae, goons increase the murder rate
Pulling up with urgency, I cut the dope like surgery
Niggas say we skimped them, bitches say I pimped them
Robbers say I tempt them, diamonds give you symptoms
Couple people know him, X him with the O him
We know that you told, let the paperwork expose him
Penthouse at the Twelve the neighbors tripping bout the odor
Bitch I know you fucking off you just fucked the promoter
Diamonds in my motor, diamonds on my choker
All these hundreds on me bitch I feel like a promoter
I fucked her too but when I see her act like I don't know her
See you later alligator bout to meet with Oprah

[Hook]
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
It got me smiling like it's diamonds in my mouth
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Cause it's a drought but I'm not ever running out
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
Marijuana war I'll burn your crop down
Why I'm the only nigga happy in the drought
I'm stashing bricks and pounds, the drought I'll bring 'em out

[Intro]
Southside on the track, yeah
Hah

[Verse 1]
Gucci Mane Soprano, my plug call me Carlo (Carlo)
Act so 

[?], I should order some cargo
European auto, Instagram model
Drankin' out the bottle, heard she like to swallow
Gucci Mane a model, snakes all on my collar
Brand new Winnebago, lay low with the yayo
Yellow bone chicano, her brother call me Gato
These kicks ain't one day old, one rock then they retro
On your marks, get set, go, I'm racin' with a peso
Rainbow with the crayons, they red, blue, green and yellow
If you hang out with narcos, then I can be your partner
I live by the G-code, my paper work proper

[Hook]
Gato, Gato, Gato

Murder, Gato, work, Gato
Been, chase, gato, feeling, gun, ass, kill, skkrt, bass

[Verse 2]
I just got a truck-load, I'm dancin' like I'm Diddy (Diddy)
I deliver bundles, I'll take over your city (Guwop)
Chopper fully-auto, I'll smoke you like some midgie
Bullets big as potholes, they'll merk you while I'm pissin'
CEO, I'm honcho, got twenty-five assistants
My bricks came with a barcode, but I don't sign to get it
Don't fuck no more you broke ho, give her to my assistance
That wig she got on so old, gave her two stacks to fix it
I'm a desperado, free all the desperados
Twenty years been back home, he still got his bravado
My homeboy from Michoacán, tequilla out the bottle
You ain't on what Gucci on, a hundred million dollars

[Hook]
Gato, Gato, Gato

Konvict (Konvict)
Ohhh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Just one look in the mirror
And I know I don't look the same being alone
I don't walk the same without you on my arm, I lost my charm
I don't know how I made it before
Cuz you are my future for sure
And now that it's over I dont know how I'm gonna get by

[Chorus:]
With no more you 

[x2]
What am I gonna do?
With no more you
To see me through
With no more you
What am I gonna do?
With no more you
Can't believe there's no more you

I look at my passenger side
And there's nobody to ride with me for life
It feels like the end, I lost my friend
I can't sleep at night
Because your side ain't occupied
The hurt in my eyes, won't go away
I'm in so much pain

[Chorus:]
With no more you 

[x2]
What am I gonna do?
There's no more you
To see me through
With no more you
What am I gonna do?
There's no more you
Can't believe there's no more you

Don't know if I can make it or not
Everybody sees that I'm going through a lot
It's hard being alone
When you used to be on top
Call for you, there's no more you
I stop for a minute then I pinch myself
I can't believe I'm here by myself
I can't do anything without your help
Call for you, there's no more you..Ohhh

[Chorus: (x2)]
With no more you
What am I gonna do?
There's no more you
To see me through
With no more you
What am I gonna do?
There's no more you
Can't believe there's no more you
No more you
What am I gonna do
There's no more you
To see me through
No more you..
What am I gonna do
There's no more you
Can't believe there's no more you 

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Life is a teacher, time is a healer
And I'm a believer like a river wild
Ego's a killer, greed is a monster
But love is stronger, stronger than them all

[Pre-Chorus]
White flag in hand, I don't wanna fight
No lines in the sand, I'm on your side
Invisible, no colour life
It's time we put our, put our, put our differences aside

[Chorus]
Time tells no lies
It keeps changing, and ticking, and moving, then passes by
But if you're lucky, it will be kind
Like a river flowing through time

[Post-Chorus]
(Like a river) let it wash you clean
(Mighty river) going up stream
(Like a river) cutting through right
(Mighty river) 'cause it never gives up
(Like a river) so full of life
(Mighty river) liquid like time
(Like a river) let it wash away
(Mighty river) the pain from yesterday

[Verse 2]
Love is the answer, hate is a cancer
Hope of forgiveness, it waters the soul
Our blood is red, we're not so different
'Cause underneath our skin we're identical

[Pre-Chorus]
White flag in hand, we're not gonna fight
No lines in the sand, I'm on your side
Invisible, no colour life, oh
It's time we put our, oh, put our differences aside
We know wrong from right

[Chorus]
Oh, time tells no lies
He keeps changing, and ticking, and moving, then passes by
But if you're lucky, it will be kind
Oh, like a river flowing through time, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(Like a river) let it wash you clean
(Mighty river) going up stream
(Like a river) cutting through right
(Mighty river) 'cause it never gives up
(Like a river) so full of life
(Mighty river) liquid like time
(Like a river) let it wash away
(Mighty river) the pain from yesterday
(Like a river) oh, oh, oh
(Mighty river) rain down on me
(Like a river) all it takes is time
(Mighty river) to heal this bloodline
(Like a river) better wash me clean
(Mighty river) get this dirt off of me, yeah
(Like a river) oh, oh, oh
(Mighty river) let it wash the pain
Oh, oh, oh yeah
(Like a river) oh, like a river
(Mighty river) mighty and better river
(Like a river) oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mighty river) let it wash away
(Like a river) oh, oh, oh
(Mighty river) oh, all the hurt and pain
(Like a river) oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mighty river) oh mighty river, mighty river

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming OGs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

[Hook: Eminem & Knock-Turn'al]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I watch)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played, the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher

[Hook: Eminem & Knock-Turn'al]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
And uh, I started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
Listenin' to the radio, wishin' that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
Listen, I got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
Hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, "Have a heart" — fuck they feelings
I've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers, haha
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore it
A war? They ain't ready for it haha

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came

The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name

But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain

But everywhere that I go, I got people I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch, bitch!"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Haha, watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm a outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' 'til I die
In my drop-top, double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watchin niggas out of sight, in my night scope
Cookin' white dope, got my nigga 25-to-life stressed out
Tryin' to have all the better things in life
While Makaveli — a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heed, from out the Bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the Earth and the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's alright
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated 'til the death
Tryin' to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'

'Less she lookin' at me, throwin' that shit back, ayy
20 motherfuckin' racks on a bad day
Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'
Drunk and it ain't no comin' back
Pussy nigga don't get hit up with the .30
Sendin' bullets lookin' all across the map, ayy

Shooter right beside me with the Curry
You gon' let me ride 'cause I

Wait, cracked that Hennessy and now I'm drunk, ayy
We don't know you, you can't smoke the blunt, ayy
Yeah, I see the opps in the front but
I got a Glock in my Louis V draws
Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'
Drunk and it ain't no comin' back
I might pull up to her block, 7:30
And fuck her once, I know I'll get attached
She mad I keep pullin' on her tracks
Bought her Uber here but I didn't buy it back
Fuck a 'lac, all of this is facts
She just wanna throw that ass back when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Jumped in the 'What-the-fuck-is-that'
Took a shot of Henny out the back
Girl you know it's real, I ain't tryna brag

And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
When you're hanging upside down
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

The trust is that it might affect you for the rest of your life
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room
You know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know
Gangster
I know

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks (Lana Del Rey)]
Let's go
Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my c*** too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo
(Say you remember!)
Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
(Say you remember!)
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em
(Gangster)

[Azealia Banks]
Gangster's not dead
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em

[Verse 1]
Human beings, vermin weed
Made of old technology
So I succeed, supersede
Exterminated like paint to acetone

[Refrain]
All is known

[Verse 2]
You've got gaps, synapses
I'm connected to the network
You are weak, organic
You've got muscle, I am made of steel bone

[Refrain]
All is known

[Verse 3]
Burn their meat, sweep the streets
Bind their hands unto their feet and
Digitise, cut the eyes from the king
And augment to the fourth cone

[Refrain]
All is known

[Refrain]
All is known

[Verse 1]
Join me at the table if you'd like to place a bet
All the cash that's filling your pockets is waiting to be spent
I know you've never played but drinks are free, it's so bizarre
Even if you lose a few chips, it's cheaper than the bar

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Verse 2]
The king extends his head, he looks into my palm
I don't know if he wants to shake it or cut it from my arm
The dealer sits washing all the burned cards from the deck
I think he might be trying to clean them, but I'd have to double check

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Verse 3]
All your money's scared and you're down to betting skins
But have you heard of a trick called spooking? It'll help you win
But tricks are just for children and cheating is a sin
And now you're down to the felt on the table and security's moving in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Beginner's luck of course backfired
Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Southside on the track, yeah
Gato
Gato
Huh,Huh
Go!

[Verse]
All the bricks mixed I'm focused
Take the whole load keep smoking
No IG stay focused
Dump 'em on the road keep rolling
Snitches got me moving slow motion
Thousand pints ain't no motion
Feds got a young nigga glowing
Get rich or die trying like Jody
My bankroll I can't fold it
Bank so big can't post it
Pull up in the club and we loaded (skrt)
It's robbers in the club and we noticed
It's killers in the club and they know it
Send bullets in the club and they know it
It's hitters in the club and I notice
It's envy in the club and it's showing
All the cash in I'm blowing
Different countries I'm touring
The messy bitch is so boring
Only thing I'm fucking is foreign
Got diamonds on my neck I'm litty
Pull up and go big on Diddy
So how you goin big on Biggie?
Young nigga selling kush like midget (Gato)

[Chorus: bearface]
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through

[Verse: bearface]
Thank you notes came falling out your mouth
Never wished for you to see it, was never what we were about
Only color in your eyes when you look me through that blue
Now you're sinking 'cause the water risin' up around your collar
If you wish to call me over, I'd be right around the corner
I'd be in the water with ya, I'd be sinking with you
But you

[Chorus: bearface]
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through

[Bridge: bearface]
Stay clear, ah
Stay clear, ooo
Stay clear, ah-ahh
Stay clear, ooo

[Outro: bearface]
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
Hold me back or I'll fall on cold old light
Come to us for fixing your sore mind
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
The fault line
The fault line
The fault line, yeah
The fault line

I've been thinking 'bout some jiggle bells (ring, ring, ring, ring)
Snow falling on the window-sill (ooh)
Santa baby you can pull ahead, yeah (yeah)
Just make sure you got that thing to give, yeah (I do, baby)

Baking cookies for you, know you wanna taste it, don't you be shy (shy oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Feeling good yeah, I'm full of cheer (oh)
I've been waiting for them 12 reindeer
Sittin', chillin' under the mistletoe (woo)

Santa baby stay a little, don't you rush, we got time (got time)
I wanna take a selfie with you, show the world you're all mine, all mine, yeah

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
'Cause this Christmas, will be the
First time that I tell you I'm in love with you
But hol' up Santa baby, I got trust issues
I know you gon' be dashing through the snow, down these chimneys
I know you got plans, I just wanna make sure you feel me
'Cause this Christmas, will be the
Greatest time of your life from me
I ain't asking for the diamond rings
I ain't really got a list of expensive things
I just want you to myself while the children sleeps
Santa baby, would you make a little time for me?

[Bridge: Ella Mai & Chris Brown]
Hooray!

Sweet pie

Never leave my piece, .40 under the seat
Protect my family 'cause I don't trust the police now
Love my choppa and I know she loves me
Ain't no safety 'cause it got the lemon squeeze

Say you got a problem, my nig', so what's the problem?
It can go down right now, this slaughter
Should think smarter, should think better
And I ain't 'bout to argue with a grown ass nigga
I ain't here to play no games, give a fuck who you claim
Choppa on me, this the gang, I let it bang

We keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches
Rough sex when we practicing
Love when we goin' at it
Girl, just let go and let this happen
Close your eyes, feel my magic stick
We keep fucking up these mattresses
And my back got all these scratches
Rough sex when we practicing
Love when we goin' at it

[Verse 1]
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

[Verse 2]
Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I’m proud of
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

[Verse 3]
And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 1]
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’mma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone

[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse 2]
She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy don’t please my ass
If shit was on the other foot then you would leave my ass
Ay, True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal and you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try justify thinkin', man we finna be rich
While some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks

[Hook]
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Then she loves me not

[Verse]
I'm never growing up
Stay forever young
Me and all my friends will run the world
Runnin' from the gun
Diamonds in our lungs
Sirens flashing purple when we drive
Guess it's in our blood
Burning rubber up
We could go for miles, and miles, and miles
Never gonna stop
Keep it super hot
2 hundred on a highway

[Chorus]
They see us, they go, "wow, yeah."
Wow, yeah, yeah
Wow, yeah, wow

We could go for miles, and miles, and miles
Never gonna stop
Keep it super hot
2 hundred on a highway

[Chorus]
They see us, they go, "wow, yeah."

I can see right through your rib cage
You're like a ghost, you fade away

'Cause you've been watching too much television
And you've been taking too many prescriptions
Yeah, I can see right through your rib cage

Your bones don't glow like they used to glow
Like they used to do
Your bones don't glow like they used to glow
Like they used to do-oh-oh, woo-oo

I think you need to take some time off and just chill on your own
I think you should stop hanging 'til 6, instead you should go home
I think you need to let go of the substance you choose to abuse
'Cause I'm not gonna save you

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Blah, blah, blah, same shit every song
What kind of drugs Ameer on? What kind of boys you fucking on?
It's like the same damn sh—fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
My life on display, I'm always live streamin', always tweetin'
Always doin' some shit that's gon' get me in trouble
It's McDoubles and a Sprite, every night
I used to live a boring life in a suburban cold town, I'm cold now
My family used to think I was useless and clueless
Really, I had visions same way that fuckin' Snoop did, shit
Should've never grew up 'cause I found out Santa Claus was fake
And because I realized I had to tell my family that I'm—
Blah, blah, blah, same shit every song
What kind of drugs Ameer on? What kind of boys you fuckin' on?
It's like the same damn shit every time I log on
It's a new lame nigga that wanna see us fail
Well, we always to the future, I'ma always do it well
I met these niggas when I was twelve and Lord knows, I've seen Hell
Probably shouldn't fuckin' be here, sorry to my fuckin' past life
Searching for my dad's ghost even though that man alive

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I done dodged a bullet when they caught me with an empty bag
Sixteen, rockin' the system inside my mom's van
Would've took this shit to Kentucky fast if I had the chance
I put myself before a lot of people and I get nothing back
How y'all always know what I'm thinking? I guess you got me pinned
I bet they know me so well, they could draw my fingerprints
See, I'ma stay in the sky, I'm like an idle jet
And I ain't worth shit as well, I know I got regrets
My baby bad, got me beatin' just like some cardio
I hit the gas on the Caddy and then I adiós
Fuck you, fuck y'all, and y'all way back there
I don't like nobody hang 'round here
Two-faced so they face just to say they been there
I ain't no better, I'm a fuckin' prick
I stay my ass in the house, and I ain't left for days
Maybe I should run away and lay away until I'm all okay

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
How many firetrucks can I count?
They drive real fast past my house
How many firetrucks can I count?
They drive real fast pass my house

[Speech]
I'm not here to talk about politics, we're not here to think about politics. We're here for a release, we're here for some music, a release from all the bullshit
*Someone shouts "fuck Donald Trump*
Ah, but that's the thing, it's not even really about fuck Donald Trump, that's the thing. It's not even that..

We've been in America for like, three months during the election and we were in the UK during Brexit so we fucking picked our time in this year. But that's not, that's kind of not the rhetoric that's needed cause I was so angry and I know, look at- We see loads of young, liberal, compassionate people every night so this is like our world, this is the world that we see. So when things go at odds of that, it's really confusing and it's really fucking- It makes you really angry and the thing is, I know it's very sad to see all of these young voices of progression and change being drowned out by regressive ideals and bullshit. It's very sad. And it appears to be paradigms of race and it is about that, and it is about gender, and it is about age, and it is about sexuality, but it's also about a lot of these people that voted against for what we stand for

They feel so so disenfranchised by both sides of political systems that that felt like the right thing to do. So if we're young, right? And we're liberal, and we're compassionate, and we're Muslim and we're black, and we're gay, and we're whatever. If we are that then it's our responsibility to be compassionate, to listen to everybody, listen to their concerns and move things forward. And you are our people and we love you so fucking much, you have no idea. This song's about loving someone..

[Chorus]
You should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..

[Verse 1]
My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep selling me
Beside celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
That they matter, who are they gonna batter next?
Just keep hold of their necks and keep selling them sex
It’s better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
Disenfranchised young criminal minds in a car park beside where your nan resides are not slow
They’ve just never been shown that you should be..

[Chorus]
Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..

[Verse 2]
We're all human, we're just like you man
We’re sentient or something or other I can’t remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer on the ground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex..
I think I should be..

[Chorus]
Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..

[Interlude: Spoken Word]
I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across the mid-afternoon
She blazed about how ‘Cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality – living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect to touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon
And between the rolling roofs and spires of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

[Chorus]
Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh..

[Verse 1]
You look at me
I fake a smile so you won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl ya talk about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
You talk to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when you're with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You say you're so in love, you finally got it right
I wonder if you know you're all I think about at night

[Chorus]
You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
You walk by me
Can't you tell that I can't breathe?
And there you go, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold ya tight, give you all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

[Chorus]
You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Chorus]
You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
You're the time taken up, but there's never enough
And you're all that I need to fall into
You look at me
I fake a smile so you won't see

[Verse 1]
Give a fuck about love, baby I'm a runaway
There's never gonna be us, doesn't mean you shouldn't stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I take you there, and you take me there
Yeah, we should be there together
Give a fuck about love, baby I'm a runaway
I just wanna, I wanna escape
Getting drunk on cheap champagne
Take a chance, make a little mistake or two
I just want a forever spring break
In my underwear, dance in the rain
Take a chance, make a million mistakes with you

[Chorus]
'Cause we only got one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
'Cause we only got one life, one life
We don't gotta fall in
These teenage kicks are gold
For you, I'd trade it all for one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
Fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in

[Verse 2]
Roll it all the way down, leaning out the limousine
Yeah, we're blossoming now, show you things you never seen

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I take you there, and you take me there
Yeah, we should be there together
Give a fuck about love, baby we got all we need
I just wanna, I wanna escape
Getting drunk on cheap champagne
Take a chance, make a little mistake or two
I just want a forever spring break
In my underwear, dance in the rain
Take a chance, make a million mistakes with you

[Chorus]
'Cause we only got one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
'Cause we only got one life, one life
We don't gotta fall in
These teenage kicks are gold
For you, I'd trade it all for one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
Fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in

[Bridge]
I'm in love with this feeling, got me high as the ceiling
And I'm not coming down, down
I'm not coming down
I'm in love with this feeling, got me high as the ceiling (yeah)
And I'm not coming down, down
I'm not coming down
Yeah, we all the way up
All the way up

[Chorus]
'Cause we only got one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
'Cause we only got one life, one life
We don't gotta fall in
These teenage kicks are gold
For you, I'd trade it all for one night, one night
We don't gotta fall in
Fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love, love, love, love
We don't gotta fall in love

[Intro: Joba]
I'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it
I'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type
Why don't you take your mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?" (Bitch)
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay (Bitch)
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my hand off and, and my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
I got my hand on an ounce, so now I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
I took an eighth of them shrooms, now I've been hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't think the monsters ever left my bedroom
I been hiding in the closet, outta legroom
I don't know if that little somethin' ever helped you
All I know is I can't trust what's in my head too
I been running from the words I never said to ya
I been duckin' all the judgement, let me say it through ya
I was fighting till they said I can't defend you
All I know is I'm the one you should've stepped to
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin'
I'm on a mission, every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk that want a ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like
And, yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say "fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

[Outro: Joba]
Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercover
Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercover

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you

[Verse: Ryan Beatty & Kevin Abstract]
You wanna talk
The words rollin' out
I'll be right there
I'll save you from your bedroom
Move to Utah (I'll be there)
And I'll be okay (I'll be there)
The reason I thank you
I know heaven don't exist for fools

[Extended Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
This is my confession tape
All the words I had to say, I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you
I send 'em back to you

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
But who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
And I got a bonus but I ain't seen it yet
I've got streaming money, I ain't seen it yet
I got a bitch that love me, I ain't seen her yet
I got a bitch that love me, I don't seem depressed
I can't adjust, I can't adjust, I can't adjust, I can't adjust
Takes confidence, the confidence to conquer
These motherfucker shake hands with these fuckers, traitors
Thank confidence, the confidence to conquer, conquer
I don't shake hands with no motherfuckin' cowards

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I been smokin' nigga, fuck my drug test
Block get hotter, need a bulletproof vest
I been runnin' since I hit my first lick
Seen that chopper turn that dog to a bitch
The money is dirty, these niggas launderin' it
Stashin' the weed, we run from the lawmen again
And the sheriff is comin', he think he caught me again
But the barrel is barkin', he ain't walkin' again
And I ain't playin', I'm in the game like E and A
And runnin' thangs is in my veins and DNA
My flow is colder than eskimos and Himalayans
I speak in tongues but niggas know just what I'm sayin'
I'm thinkin' different like protozoas and atom splittin'
But niggas shootin' and runnin' out of they ammunition
I keep it movin' and only ride if my niggas with me
And we ain't scared, my niggas swang and hang with me

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
One body, two body, pressed in a room with nobody, body
Grab yo' engine like Bugatti, seen bubbles in Bali, Bali

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I was gettin' bald touchin' sands in the moonlight
You was gettin' old, each summer could move right
Lips slide to cheek, last time that I seen ya'
Rugged buck eye walkin' down by the beaches
Hardly acknowledge the fact that I love you
Practice voodoo on me, I can feel when you want it
In another dimension, you're a blip in the matrix
A hat trick, never seen a real life, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down (oh)
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
All I do is work and play (Ay-yah-woo-woo)
Tryna' find a place to stay (Ay-yah-woo-woo)
Tryna' find some food today (Ay-yah-woo-woo)
This shit is real hard okay? (Okay)
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ain’t it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it? (Ain't it?)
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man, they ain't friendly

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down (oh)
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]
I just saw my P.O. (what up, nigga?)
He like me, though (he like me, though)
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets, though
Seven days a week though, (all day) it's that heat, though
My daddy called me, said he seen my last video
Looking at a younger me, coulda had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' 'til it's all gone, smoking 'til my folks come home

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

[Outro: Joba]
Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again
Mmmm, oh oh, again

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I'm a felon, watch me film it
Bad baby, watermelon in her denim
Like the brother from Miami
White powder, tell his bros, know I'm 'bouta
Tell them I was ready, right now I be ready (boy got it!)
Take a head, put it through the public housing (break my body)
Pay for it with my own tax dollars (I don't want it)
Pay for killing brothers been (Merlyn Merlyn)

[Hook: Matt Champion]
Boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy, please don't go picking on my insecurities
Boy, boy, boy

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'ma keep my distance from the cowards
I done put in twenty thousand hours
I don't want your co-sign for the hour
Everything is sweet while niggas sour
They don't know about a nigga's story
They could love me in the moment, in the future they'll ignore me
What ya doin' for me, huh?
I don't think them niggas seem to recognize
Cutting through the crap like I got pesticides, weaponize

[Verse 3: Joba]
What have I told you? I know who I am
(You can't tell me shit)
People are pointing their fingers at me
(I'm not the one to play with)
White flags, fly so free
(You can't tell me shit)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down for me
(I'm not one to play with)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down for me

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I always pay in cash, so I ain't got no credit
I'ma need a co-signer if you're tryna get it
Moved up out the house, close my bank account
They couldn't fill my check, I need to buy a jet
I ain't been the same since Viceland paid
See me on the screen, my million dollar face
My momma told me I was gonna be a star, yeah
I paid the debt and then I went a bought a car, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave (Before I leave)
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me (You ain't shit to me)
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me (You ain't shit to me)
I'll break a nigga head before I leave (Before I leave)
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap

[Verse: Merlyn Wood]
Coming from a hard place, I'm a resident
What they do right, had my life with embellishment
Representing shit, my Instagram I only slay
Talking reckless, my brain spin faster than that shit

[Outro]
Find me useless

[Intro: Joba]
I chainsmoke 'til I choke
Have a good heart but bad health
You would never know
Where can you turn at the end of a road
Let myself go, I know I'm at fault
'Cause I'm not who I thought at all
Smokescreens in the dark
I just drink and drive
The freeway eases my mind and I can cry on my own
Going 95, no one on the passenger's side
But the person in the rear view's telling lies

[Verse: Joba]
You could end it all if you'd like to
And you can drink a fifth and, uh
Drive to, um, wherever you'd like to
'Cause, well, nobody likes you
And nobody feels like you do
Plus, nobody understands the weight of the
Broken heart that you feel, so fuck it
You might as well just get real high and stupid
Rent a motel room and drink away your issues
It could be so simple, nobody wants to help you
They laugh and smile because you're different, you know
It's all your fault but you stay well-tempered
You've always had your wits about you
You hide away, so mental
And I'm glad you stay reclusive
You have a wound that's self-inflicted
And in times like this it's too late to fix it
The weight of the world couldn't change you
And if you died, no one would miss you
So here's to another night alone with all your fears
And all your demons, your deepest darkest secrets
The shit that keeps you from sleeping
It's better when you don't think about it
But you don't have the power, 'cause I'm your master
Speed up and surrender, this time is different
So indecisive, no wonder why she left you
One of the many reasons why you'd like to
Put a bullet in your head or veer left off the highway
You're walking a tightrope at your lowest
Now you're hopeful, but that'll change when the night falls
You're a waste of a lifeform
You should do what you couldn't do this time last year
You can hope and pray all you want but nobody cares
Death waits for the time comes, and the time's come
Shut me up if you'd like to
But you're a coward and you know it's true
I'll be here if you need me, up to you

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
That's okay and I don't mind
I think you're kind of perfect
You blend in with the guys
And that's okay and I don't mind
I think you're kind of perfect
You blend in with the guys

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Around you, around you, around you, around you
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Around you, around you, around you
Sometimes I

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Everybody wanna be a star (Okay)
Everybody wanna be real (For sure)
All I wanted was to be a king (Okay)
Give the people something they can feel (For sure)
I don't really got a lot of time (Okay)
Got a lot of birds I need to kill (for sure)
Not enough stones in my hand (Okay)
That's because I like what's in the deal
So I gotta deal with it accordingly
Stars align in my hands now
You create your own reality
Just gotta understand the circumstances now
I roll a leaf around a couple grams
Yeah, I know I ain't perfect, but I got a plan now
I like to roll around in my problems before I burn 'em down, burn 'em down
So don't judge me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
All I ever wanted was a dad (Okay)
All I ever wanted was a slab (For sure)
All I ever wanted was some grills (Okay)
All I ever wanted was a bitch (For sure)
All I ever wanted was respect (Okay)
All I ever wanted was a gun (For sure)
All I ever wanted was some BAPE (Okay)
All I ever wanted was some braids
All I ever wanted was a fade
All I ever wanted was a Sidekick
All I ever wanted was some wealth
All I ever wanted was a Pocket Rocket
All I ever wanted was Rihanna
All I ever wanted was a MySpace
All I ever wanted was a MacBook
All I ever wanted was a family

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them
Motherfuckers ain't real, I'll show them

[Outro: Joba]
Things I never had
Made me who I am
These things I never had
Made me who I am
I hate myself
Said, "I hate myself"
The things I never had
Made me who I am
These things I never had
Made me who I am
Things I never had
These things I never had
Made me who I am

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Martin Luther moving back, I just bought a Cadillac
I ain't put no rims on it, niggas don't know how to act
"Where the fuck you get this cash?" Questions that my momma ask
Woke up naked on the beach, pretty bitch in the sand
Take a pic in the sand
Point and shoot in the head
None of these fit the brand
Throw all the work in the can

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey
Don't worry 'bout me, hey

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
And when I was the young one, I walked with a headphone
When I was a young one, they wouldn't let me have one
They said, "You no can none," said "You no respect none"
But I do that, ride like an idiot
You can never see me, y'all dumb piglets
I got a feeling, somethin' in your stomach
Your ten toes, bendin' shit like I'm on it
Got my hundreds wrapped up tighter
Than your ass, in them tighty-whities
I got me, like it, I got what I like it
I get what I like it, ugh, ugh
Bruh, bruh, I got that, I like it, yo
I got this, yeah, I got this
I look at you, I got this, yo, I got this
I look at you, I got this, I got this
LMAO, I split your legs like some fuckin' mayo
I call your daddy and your momma and run in they home
'Cause I'm a asshole, I'm a wild-ass nig', you know
'Cause I ain't really get no attention when I was younger
I don't, ugh, all I ever had was the hunger
And a need for the money
It's late in the night, I had munchies
It don't stop, man, it fuckin' not stoppin'
When the flow choppin, when the beat drop
I can feel the floor drop, I can feel the ceiling rise
I can feel myself high, yeah
And the girls say "Hi"
So please tell me why, that I drop this new, man
All these hits in 5:57
When I'm feelin' fly, yeah 747
Yeah, I think it's just me and my brethren

[Hook: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck, another cop car
Cop coming on my block for the answers
Bitch, I only got a few questions
Fuck it, pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, that shit don't ever work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete always hurts too
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In shit's creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing by myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker

[Hook: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Bridge: Joba]
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I’m burning rubber, I pulled up on you

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like whoop, bang
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like the shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, I guess I'm the shit

[Hook: Matt Champion]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]
Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

[Hook: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, (they don't want this) better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
I'm frosty
Cedar fender, I'm flossing
See the camo, I'm dousing
But you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudis
Hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me
Punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin'
Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin'
Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
A loser, a rental
A dentist, I been to
And take a lose from me and I'll be out it, out it
Tryna make y' smile, wanna make out
But I'm too childish, childish
Fucked a loser, in his rental
A dentist, I been to

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
You got freckles on your lip, lip, lip
They might give you cancer, shit, shit, shit
Wring your wrist and take a swish, swish, swish
Big hole, flushin' out the script, script, script
Backwoods, blowin' off a zip, zip, zip
So we still spit the belt, ain't no heaven on a hell
Brush your hair so I see your—

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em leanin' out the other side
From the smog and the smoke
Had 'em checkin' out the other side
I'm by myself, I'll probably turn up by myself
I keep delaying all my work because I can't find no help
You make me feel like such a loser

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I don't wanna be sober
So I can lie to my lovers
Got sad and said I loved her
I was high, I ain't mean it
I ain't lyin', I got problems
I'll leave for no reason
Make love with no feelings
I be your nigga for the evening

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
In between the bridges filled with kerosene
Are words we never said, turned into a routine
My feelings still remain unseen
Can't intervene with anything that's on the screen
When life is playin', they play games and expect me to pick a team
I can't win, I can't breathe, everything ain't what it seems
I played my case and then erase my underlying self-esteem
I know it's awful for my health, I know it all becomes extreme
I can't redeem from this regime that's invaded all of my dreams
From the asphalt to the steam, we found a theme then made a scene
At the moment that the guillotine was the only vaccine don't intervene
Shit ain't been the same since I was 17
Fuckin' up is in my genes, I think I need a quarantine, yeah

[Outro: Joba]
Chain-smoking, got twenty things on my mind (Yeah)
Fake feelings, when I hit it from behind (Yeah)
Consenting to my heart's demise (Oh)
I fall in love and fall in line (Oh)
Tip toe-in' in tap shoes when you're sleepin' in the corner (Shh)
Leave before I fall in love with you, I'm a self-proclaimed loner (Shh)
A novice with a master plan (Yes I am)
Genuine but fraudulent (Yes I am)

[Verse 1: bearface]
Anyway, I ain't much for the cold
In your car, I felt lost
Cut her legs covered in scars
And erase my doubts for long

[Verse 2: bearface]
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Verse 3: bearface]
Say you've lost your way and come to ask the way out soon
You always knew
Please don't stay far, I wish for more
With you

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I'm not a hypocrite, I'm human
I make mistakes to make sure I never repeat 'em
Inhaler help me breathe in South Central hot
Smoke like a chimney, I hope I don't get got
And I ain't had no pussy in two months
I been busy, man; I been working, man
And I ain't called my mom in three days
I hope she miss me, man; I know she love me, man
All these feelings bottled up, about to set me off
And most this extra meat that lingering get cut off
Yeah we been making money, yeah we been making guap
While you've been walking in the meetings 'bout to suck some— (Dick) I left my bitch in Malibu
I left my smokes up on the roof
So don't forget who you're talking to
If I bring it in existence it gon' come true

[Chorus: bearface]
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh, whoa
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my pride will make me end our love either way

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I know I make mistakes—I try to not repeat 'em
But I'm still working on it, negotiate with demons
I've stopped fucking girls the first time I meet 'em
And I don't talk to strangers about my new arrangements
I got big dreams of selling out arenas
They comin' out to see me—white folks in the meetings
And they smiling at me, but I'm the same nigga
Point them hoses at me; send the dogs for me

[Chorus: bearface]
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my pride will make me end our love either way

[Outro: JOBA]
I don't (I don't) got much (Got much) money (Money)
But I'll be alright (But I'll be alright)
Yeah, we'll be alright (Yeah, we'll be alright)
Yeah, we'll be alright (Yeah, we'll be alright)
I don't (I don't) got much (Got much) money (Money)
But I'll be alright (But I'll be alright)
Yeah, we'll be alright (Yeah, we'll be alright)
Yeah, we'll be alright (Yeah, we'll be alright)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Bag it up, I keep trapping
Used to not afford no dollar menu, now I be Big Mac, kid
Getting kicked out of PAX, that's our past tense now
When I'm in that bitch, they polite as a pastor
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go back to war
All the things that I said I'd do, I went and did
All my fault, on my own, but, kid, I said that shit
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go, every day, do the things that I s—
Bag it up, on the road
Gotta go, every day, do the things that I say

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Damn, borrow mine
She ain't need to say it 'til I bother mind
Bag in the back 'til I bother mind
Bag in the back 'til I bother mind

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him (Check, check)
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
My biggest issue is I can't have a kid
Okay, I'm lying—got some other fucking issues, bitch
I always wonder what that's like, on the other side
Guess I'll get to see it whenever my mother dies
I'm sorry, Mom, for making songs about the shit you done
You been the greatest, no excuse for a shitty son
Moved to progressive Californ-I-A, I switched up
I was raised where some niggas gettin' lynched up
If you ain't playin' ball or throwin' sets up
Was getting jumped on for tryna play dress-up
I'm tired of seeing niggas that I hate copy me
I'm tired of homophobic niggas that follow me
They're probably same type of niggas that'll swallow me
I know you think that shit was weak, but that was tongue-in-cheek
Put the tongue to the cheek—pose for the pic
You all look the same—niggas getting desperate
You want some fucking love?
You want some Instagram likes? You're posted in the club
I'm in the hotel room on tour, man
Set the stu' up everywhere I go, man
I liked Wayne when I was in the fucking sixth grade
That's why Ashlan keep the camera on me all day
A young Spike Jonze, movies on my iPhone
This music shit is cool, wait 'til you see what I'm on
I'm on one, keep it rolling, keep it rolling

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Made me wanna kill me, skin like armadillo
America the new Sodom, feel it in my blood
Let the gold drape my neck, let the silver grip my knuckles
When they ask you who shot 'em, nobody doing jail time
Nobody paying consequence, silence when it rest
Words murder all the time, now this shit offset
Now my bitch upset, yeah, I creep upstream
I'ma bury till they send me, I'm a gun to the human
I'm a psychopath
I'm a menace, man, with no dentist plan after 27
Offset, offset, I'm a skate rat (Skate rat)
I'm a mallrat with that palm sweat on my white tee (white tee)
I'm like sight, see on my CC, young CEO
I need us, I need love, I need hope (Ahh)
To keep me going, I need to keep them doors open
I ain't talkin' less the cash there, with denim and cashmere
Crib in Japan, sushi in my hand
Recording everything, bang on the thing, black everything

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 4: Joba]
I don't wanna seem too blunt, but I can't get behind this bullshit
I mean, everything you do is a nuisance
And you say you wanna ride with the shooters?
If that's true, forgive me if I'm wrong
But I'ma bet my life on it, you don't even own a gun
Wave hi as I stand outside (Hi!) with my short-shorts on
You sneak a picture, there's a shoobie on your front lawn
Hit you on the head with my flip-flop
I spin in the air, like, "I did that"
Gotta layin' low 'til I flip out, I'm a bit imbalanced, I know
20/20 vision, I'm watching, you built a career off of problems
You ain't ever deal with this toxic, you should be ashamed
I see right through the facade, you must think everyone's blind
I don't play into the lies, just thought you should know

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up, and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing

[Verse 1]
Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

[Bridge]
This is going to take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more (can't take no more)
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on

"So hold your head up, girl, and you you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than l can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, l bet she's around

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

[Verse]
Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient
And know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning

[Chorus]
But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

[Verse]
Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise

But where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

[Verse 1]
I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes

[Verse 2]
You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
I'll refuse

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die

[Bridge]
Am I me through geography?
A face collapsed through entropy
I can hardly speak
And when I try it's nothing but a squeak
On the video
Living room for small
If you can't survive, just try

[Chorus]
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I, sometimes, always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes

[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
No one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby oh
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Real life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life spent livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I'm makin' peace with all my demons 'fore I clock out
It never comes as we perceive it 'til we drop out
I'm too big to burn a bridge that I should stomp out
I got a vision, I ain't quittin' 'til I'm crossed out
And even then, I still be screamin' from the nosebleeds
To let 'em know I never let the pressure know me
You couldn't even hold a candle to the old me
So what I look like letting you try to control me
I'm on a mission to reclaim the times that broke me
The life I took is not the one that fuckin' chose me
And I ain't goin' back, I'm ridin' in the sunset
I'm pacin' between self-awareness and civil unrest
Oh, everything I sign with every label seems to suggest
My fate is pre-determined, I'm for certain that's my success

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got everything I want and I want somethin' else
I try to fill the void and pull the Bible off the shelf
Ashes on my sheets, I find it hard to sleep
I got lil' problems, I know y'all sick of hearin'
I think I'm missin' somethin', but I can't think of nothin'
(That's true)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Real life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life has been livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
In the back, in the back
Make it to Jerusalem with my fam in the back
In the back, in the back
The haters still infragrant but that payback is exact
House packed to the max
Niggas in the kitchen, niggas in the back
Nothing in my fridge, but my hunger is in that
Niggas havin' visions, layin' them own tracks
Shit been South Central, niggas in the back
In the back
When I make it, I'ma—

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I would do it in the dungeon, I barely function
I would do it in the dungeon, just barely function, picking sh—
I would do it from the dungeon, could barely function
Pickin' strawberry with my aunty, with the answers
With the long sleeves, above-ground pool in the backyard
With the bare pull, with the bad luck
'Til they wait on me, takes a while 'fore that bed, homie, dead homies

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Yeah, we be poppin' these bottles like bubblegum
Bad criminals, we on the run
Sitting like a pink pill on your tongue
'Cause we dress so fly, getting the pension
Us girls in the club get illy
Dip down, stand up, get so silly
Boy, they say our shit retarded
Yeah, they know we rock the party

[Refrain: Mercedes]
Hell yeah, drink it up, drink-drink it up
Sober boys around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
All these sober boys around me, they be actin' like they drunk

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Verse 2: Mercedes]
The one with the curly hair, kicking mad flavour in the air
Outlandish, bounce through stratospheres
Transformer, I get the crowd warmed up
Sure shock, crawl through like a warlock
Sure enough, and I just can't stop
They're waiting on me to load the shows, roll the rolls
Rock steady, now I'm ready to go

[Refrain: Mercedes]
Hell yeah, drink it up, drink-drink it up
Sober boys around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
All these sober boys around me, they be actin' like they drunk

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Bridge: MNEK]
OK, alco-poppin' when nobody is around
Beats poppin' but I don't really hear a sound
I could be your Fresh Prince with a couple pounds
Low paid shit, so you're gonna have to pay me right now
Motherfucker I'm cold, freezing
Do I look like I know what I'm doing?
It's a seizure
'Nuff skets moving in a UAT club
Fuckin' the list like their name was Kesha
Check my swag, I'm a plastic gangster
No money in my pocket, but thrills are free
High like a kite, baby you and me
We could be all happy like the end of the movies
Hell no!
Scratch it, this track ain't illegal but I sure did crack it
Super extraordinator, I'm a rotator
I left and right, I front and back it

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vuole fe yah (same DNA)

[Post-Chorus]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M

Don't be a drag, just be a queen 

[x15]

[Outro]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Intro: JID & Mark Foster]
Tell me what's your name, it was nice to meet you (What you need? What you need?)
Gather all your things and you're ready to go (What you need, man? What you need?)
Nice to meet you, it's oh so sweet (What you need? What you need, man?)
(What you need?)

[Verse 1: JID]
Look
I had a reoccurring dream really teasing my mind
A search for a better purpose to be perfectly in line
A serpent is walking, a surface is swerving; it's spewing lies
I find, I'm watching my belt, I'm wasting my time
I swung high off the sky, from a tree to the vine
To land on my feet, devious but dealing with pride
I need a...
I need a breather to catch up on my second wind and speed up
Running from Hell, a speed demon
A cell, a key jingling, jingling, jingling, a gun, bang bang
They bang, you slain, insane, they playing they game
I've been praying for things money could never buy
Like live and die as a man, a coward dies a thousand times
I'm outta sight and outta mind, I'm outta mind but don't mind it
Salvaging the silence 'til the cavalries arriving
Balancing a climate moving forward, looking up and then behind us
If you love me I can lead you where the light is

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
Save what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day at night
We're here to fight, we on the wild again
And you have the name of someone I love
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm

[Verse 2: Saba]
Pay the man, pay the man
(Pay the man) Look, mm
Run from my past like I run track, it's traumatic
My palace is Polamalu, I'm grounded like getting sacked
I race demons like Nascar, no assistance like Nascar
One step forward, two steps back watch when I'm at war

[Interlude: Mark Foster & Saba]
And when it's raining
We're sailing (At war)
Oh yeah, we're sailing
We're sailing
I'm off the leash
I go to war for peace

[Verse 3: Saba]
I sleep with an eye open like I'm monocular
I'm the opposite of a carper with carpal tunnel
Ain't never took a handout, no tunnel vision to it got my planned route
Like a cockroach in an ant farm I'ma stand out
Clock'll tick like a doggy dancing for foggy lantern
How I look for light when recording stanza, you know the answers
Uncharted area, the pressures no better medley
Yet here I am, falling right where blind man led me

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
Save what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day at night
We're here to fight, we on the wild again
And you have the name of someone I love
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm

[Bridge: Mark Foster]
(Pay the man, pay the man, pay the man)
Pay the man, you got to pay the man
Pay the man, got to pay the man, pay the man
Well, I was laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Was laughing real hard but my teeth fell out
Need a little something
Need a little something
(A little something, little something, little something)

[Chorus: Mark Foster]
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm

[Outro: Mark Foster]
Can't you see? Can't see me
Can't see me, can't see me
Yeah, can't see me, can't see me
We all run when the light comes on
Am I wrong for wanting it all?
But I warned you, mmm
Somebody was waiting
For you at the skating rink
Last night I hope you know

He's not worth your time
He's the worthless kind

He said he loves your new sweater
And you should get together
And he could take it off of you

He's got two 40s
And his mom's SUV

He wants you to stay
But you won't stay
He wants you to stay
But you won't stay
He wants you to stay
But you won't stay
Will you baby, that's okay
Won't you baby, that's okay
I feel underneath the weather, yeah
I had felt much better before
I started talking to you

You're a waste of time
You're the worthless kind

We were breathing underwater
Your mother and your father
Kept on crying out for you

But we're both too high
And you don't change your mind

We want you to stay but you won't stay
We want you to stay but you won't stay
We want you to stay but you won't stay
Will you baby, that's okay

We want you to stay but you won't stay
We want you to stay but you won't stay
We want you to stay but you won't stay
Will you baby, that's okay
She bites her nails as she waits for the train (Uh huh)
You won't look up because you know she's insane (That's right)
And if you touch her she'll shout through the tears
She'll pull your hair and scream in your ears

"The meaning it goes away sometimes
I know all the words but they don't seem to rhyme
Sometimes all I can do is lie,"
She says as the water pours from her eyes

You can't
Make me cry
You can try you can try
But you can't
Make me cry
You can try you can try
But you can't
Make me cry
You can try you can try
But you can't
Make me cry
You can try you can try
"Bloody nose and a broken tooth
Black and blue all over you,"
You say as you walk her to the bus
You're beat enough for the two of us

You'll go over under and backwards now
Things that you want are what you're not allowed
The people trying to bring you down
Are the only ones who want you around

But they can't
Make you cry
They can try they can try
But they can't
Make you cry
They can try they can try
But they can't
Make you cry
They can try they can try
But they can't
Make you cry
They can try they can try

[Intro]
I hope you
I really hope you
I really hope you
Didn't think it was gon' be
I hope you

[Chorus]
I hope you didn't think it was gon' be a fist fight, a fair fight
Hope you trained for a gun fight, we thug life
And we do it for the yellowbones, caramels
And them bitches took my cell phone, no paragraphs
My whole squad bout that money making, vice versa
And just like my girl love, I keep a tight circle
Tight circles in the race car, an eye jerker
Or did I mean an eye catcher? Vice versa
Fuck it man, I got too much money, no such thing
Top down on the supersonic, the guts clean
It's time to let our warts sting, I'm upbeat
I'm flier than these motherfuckers with one wing

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of these motherfuckers, cut strings
I'm first string
Been saying more shit than the nurse seen since thirteen
Don't seem to get why you earthlings observe me
It irks me
The cleanest shit come dirt cheap
I'm dirt deep, to stay awake forever is my worst dream
I search scenes to work schemes on the first fiend at first sight
You know it's paradise when you see blurred lights
You on your third strike

[Bridge]
Talkin' to myself my homies call me crazy
Livin' by myself my mama say I'm lonely
Sleepin' by myself my bitches think I'm lyin'
Listening to myself cause I'm my favorite artist
Dependent on myself, the people call me mighty
Defending more than self, the people call me hero
I'm good within myself, the people say I'm humble
And I'm protecting myself trying to stay away from evil, Lord

[Verse 2]
Trapping way before they called it trapping
Pop a Xanny like a motherfucking Aspirin
Got a pocket full of snow, they call me Aspen
Got a Phantom full of smoke while you gasping, uh
Pocket full of stones, talking moonrock
Cause that molly make these broads think they 2Pac
The molly make these niggas think they killers
The molly give my trigger finger the jitters, Lord
I was 15 in a new drop
Pulling up on the scene in the school house
Make a bad bitch cuss her dude out
Wait, I was 15 in a new house
Fucking right, bad bitch, nothing nice
And she something like my fucking wife
But now all we do is fucking fight
I feel like a young nigga can't do nothing right
But my money right, we alright, yeah

[Chorus]
Fist fight, a fair fight
Hope you trained for a gun fight, we thug life
And we do it for the yellowbones, caramels
And them bitches took my cell phone, no paragraphs
My whole squad bout that money making, vice versa
And just like my girl love, I Keep it tight circle
Tight circles in the race car, an eye jerker
Or did I mean an eye catcher? Vice versa
Fuck it man, I got too much money, no such thing
Top down on the supersonic, the guts clean
It's time to let our warts sting, I'm upbeat
I'm flier than these motherfuckers with one wing

[Outro]
I was trapping way before they called it trapping
Pop a Xanny like a fucking Aspirin
Pocket full of snow, they call me Aspen
Phantom full of smoke while you gasping, uh
Pocket full of stones, talking moonrock
The molly make these hoes think they 2Pac
The molly make these niggas think they killers
The molly give my trigger finger the jitters
It's Tunechi bitch, I do it for the sippers
It's Tunechi bitch, I do it for the sippers
It's Tunechi bitch, I do it for the strippers
I do it for the cocaine whippers, yeah
Mula baby
TD on the beat
Mannie on the beat
Yeah

[Intro]
Go down, soft sound
Okay

[Verse]
Go down, soft sound
Midnight, car lights
Playing with the air
Breathing in your hair
Go down, go down
Soft sound
Step into your skin, I'd rather jump in your bones
Taking up your mouth so you'll breathe through your nose

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set

Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

I'm beautiful in my way

In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I was born this way
I was born this way

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital "H"im
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Way)
(Same DNA)

Okay, okay

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
And what can I say? I'm feeling you

[Verse 1]
He's a legend in the making
This voice is the blame to fame
His rhythm is similar to basketball
The way he shakes and he fakes and he takes some more
With everything he does, makes me feel his love
When the DJ plays this song and we all sing along
Up in the club with our hands in the air and it's all because
He's a poet, if the world doesn't say it, I hope that he knows it
This is for Chris, big up to Nas, this is for Biggie, of course
Shout out to Brooklyn, and here's to the Bronx where it all begin

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press rewind
And what can I say? I'm feeling you

[Verse 2]
When I was growing up in the Boogietown
Hoping that music would be my faith
Looking for a way to escape
Recording the radio, took a set tape
They all sold to the UMC's
Snoop Dogg, Andre and now it's 50
All day, every day
'Cause MC's, they make me feel a special way (A special way)
Down south and your families
Back up to Bone Thugs N' Harmony
And I can't forget the ladies
Oh no, the ladies, knowing you crazy
'Lil Kim, Queen Latifah, you the queen
Salt N Pepa, Mary J. and Eve
You'll need to understand
Sugarhill made me wanna be who I am

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind (My mind)
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time (Long time)
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press rewind
And what can I say? I'm feeling you

[Verse 1]
Whatever you don't know
Baby, I will teach you
Anywhere you go
Know my love can reach you
Not a wall too high
Or a mountainside
Could keep me from seeing you

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're too tired
I could give you power
Go the extra mile
In your darkest hour
Any day or night
Call my name and I
I'll come running to be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be fierce as a tiger
If anyone tries to fight ya
But I'll be soft as a lamb
When you're in my hands
I can bend
However I need to

[Chorus]
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
My fears and my flaws
You stand through it all
That's what I call love

[Verse 4]
I will understand
When you need space
I will hold your hand
When you're in pain
I'll be patient and pause
Most relationships
Require a give and take

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will never let my ego
Nor the words of other people
Get in the way
Or stop from saying
How much I care and I need you

[Chorus]
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
My fears and my flaws
You stand through it all
That's what I call love

[Bridge]
For better or for worse
That's what I call love...baby
It's more than just a word
Let me show you my love...baby

[Chorus 2]
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
My fears and my flaws
You stand through it all
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
That's what I call love
People told me I should write a love song
Girl you sound so angry, you could use some variation
But I'm lonely, negative relations
I've been hurt so many times I don't have the patience
But I wished for so long for some one to come and show me
Lead by example, cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
I want to be someone's girl, will you show me the way

What if... I never find, and I'm left behind (should I keep hoping for love)
What if... I'm still the same, status doesn't change (gotta keep hoping for love)
What is love what is love what is love... somebody show me
What is love what is love what is love... cause if ya told me
What is love what is love what is love... I would be lonely
What is love... please show me what is love

I've had blind dates, hooked up with some real flakes
I gone out with church boys, musicians are thee worst
I've tries so hard cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part, wish you could see inside
But I wished for so long for some one to come and show me
Lead by example, cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
I want to be someone's girl, will you show me the way
What if... I never find, and I'm left behind (should I keep hoping for love)
What if... I'm still the same, status doesn't change (gotta keep hoping for love)
What is love what is love what is love... somebody show me
What is love what is love what is love... cause if ya told me
What is love what is love what is love... I would be lonely
What is love... please show me what is love
Nanana

What is love?

I've been alone for the last past three years on Valentines Day
Christmas is no exception, birthdays with naughty? presents
Back and forth, same action
I just need this to happen, I'm missing in loves embraces
If you would show me

What if... I never find, and I'm left behind (should I keep hoping for love)
What if... I'm still the same, status doesn't change (gotta keep hoping for love)
What is love what is love what is love... somebody show me
What is love what is love what is love... cause if ya told me
What is love what is love what is love... I would be lonely
What is love... please show me what is love

'Cause nowadays I ain't gotta package that crack
Keep ties to the streets so I ain't gotta go back
Certified pimp, bona fide mack

[Intro]
Owwww
Young Money in this motherfucker

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
There is no peace
I ride 'till there is no wheels
Till there is no streets
Like where is my piece
They dying in them cells or already dead
Or tryna kill themselves
I rep my niggas, I love my city
I feel myself and she feel my wealth
So it will not help, I gotta get me
And money like pussy and I gotta get deep
So I gotta get street cause it's riding on me
My niggas can't drive, I got riders with me
And nah I ain't into that back and forth chit chat
As a matter fact I'mma end that
Prone to destruction, home is corrupted
Stones in my dungies won't do the justice
Them hundred dollar homes is in abundance
Hustle on a mountain, hustle in a tundra
Get that money or don't function
Punctuation exclamation exclamation period
That's the way I have to make it
S to K, you better take it, idiots period
Bullshit, I pity it
Them guns shot so loud you would think I MIDI'd it
I shot more than once, I'm ab-libing it
Oh well you been in hell so what, I live in it
I'm giving it all I got for them incentives
Riding for them benefits and now it's back to 10 a brick
I like 'em thin and thick
Really I like 'em thick, high yellow and shit
Weezy F Baby

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Hot Spitta, nigga, flow so sick
Sidekick talkin' to my older bitch

They got these niggas in the street tryna 

[?]
That's cool, bring it, I got guns for you son
I'm talkin' about 17 other Glocks with the beam
Homie, I guarantee that I don't miss
Hot Spitta ride slow
Two burners on the seat
Cops can't get addicted to my grind
Bitches stop riches, mami I ain't got time
Respect a nigga mind, bitch I'm tryna get my cake
They hatin' on me, they don't wanna see me get my shine
Gon' make me whack one of them niggas 'cause they fake
745 and I ride for that Uh
'Cause what I hustle for, these niggas try to take
But before they run up on me I'ma put it on his mind
Then they gon' find his body floatin' in a lake
I'm tryna figure out with 

[?]
These niggas mistake my kindness for weakness
Ain't nobody sweet bitch
Young money YM that street shit
Nothin' but heat slick
Rockin' you to sleep quick
Don't fuck around with the dudes
'Cause I ride around with them tools
And I bring the drama to crews
You know I keep sick, yeah!

[Intro]
At the core
I despise myself
Outside opinions and stinging precision:
I despise myself

[Verse 1]
Strings winding through my skin, direct me
Connected to a grin I'm forcing
I really hate what I'm saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Send all my memories back with all the things
I don't deserve
Distraught dark thoughts back on

[Chorus]
I'm found frail
Feeling like a walking stigma
Lacking self esteem
Finite fail
Am I the only one against me
Trusting a disease?

[Verse 2]
Dark thoughts back on
A little darker this time
Anticipation of rejection
I'm holding hands with self-doubt
Hide the stigma
I was not always this way

[Bridge]
Harem scare 'em!

[Break]
Send back all the things
I'll only burn
Watch me walking backwards

[Chorus]
I'm found frail
Finite fail
Am I the only one against me
Trusting a disease as I despise myself?
As I despise myself
In an excerpt from Plato's Symposium, Aristophanes recounts the origins of love. According to his Greek mythology, humans were once four-legged, four-armed, and double-sexed. Fearing human beings were becoming too powerful, the deity Zeus sliced them in half, leaving their heads facing inward so they could eternally measure their bodies' absences. They were thus doomed to feel incomplete until they found their other halves. And when they did, they would throw their arms around each other and weave their flesh in an attempt to become one again.

In the Bible's Genesis, after creating Adam (the prototype), God realizes that he requires a mate. He rips a rib from Adam's body and begets Eve, a built-in lifelong partner.

Many of the origin stories about the inception of our species establish this blueprint for coexistence – that every body has an equal and opposite body, a destined companion without which we are incomplete. Our modern construct of romance still upholds this paradigm; romantic love is the paramount prize of existence. But what if I can't access that prize?

In response to this construct, Aromanticism is a concept album about lovelessness as a sonic dreamscape. It seeks to interrogate the idea that romance is normative and necessary.

This isn't protest music, however, as much as it is process music. It's the 2am sweat you wake up in, processing that lonesomeness might not just be a transitory hallway you're passing through en route to inevitable partnership. It's recognizing statelessness as stasis. It's admitting that you still desperately crave affection, even if you're not fully capable of returning it. It's admitting that your favorite self-empowerment chorus, “I may be alone but I'm not lonely!” is, often, bullshit. It's wondering why, as a first grader, you would unbox your markers and couple them into personified pairs. It's wondering why every restaurant you take yourself to has each table pre-set for two. It's wondering how privileged people can feel love interpersonally but still adhere to systems of social hierarchy that cause them to treat othered groups with loveless indifference. It's wondering if our urgent fear of dying alone is cellularly inherent or socially inherited. It's wondering – if God is love, but you don't feel love, are you a godless being?

Alternative titles for Aromanticism could be: Narcissus; Don't Touch Me; Please Touch Me; Sure, Let's Touch Each Other but Please Leave Right After We Cum; Grey A; It's Not You, It's Me; It's Not You – Actually, It's Not Anyone; It's Not Me, It's My Childhood.

The not-yet-dictionary definition of an “aromantic” is someone who doesn't experience romantic love, or does to a diminished, abnormal degree. I'm just trying to get it out from over the squiggly red line.

Hands in my pocket

Why every bitch wanna fuck on me?
I'm gay, what'd I do to deserve this?
Gimme that pussy, that pussy
I wanna love your pussy, but I hate pussy

Don't  stay, don't stay, don't stay

But you're the first one I call, you could always make it right
But things ain't the same, I'm a different kind of nigga
I need Broadway lights, I need eight gold figures
I need money, keep the fame, I need pussy, keep the love
Watered lean, it's the same, I need Jesus up above
I need seven more days and I need forty more nights
'Cause I don't know the right way and my mind ain't right
So I smoke and pray about it, I don't sleep through the night
I need more, I need, wait a minute

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know I had to go and keep the flow real quick
Jesse step in the

And it sound like I checked my sight on my right
But I don’t even do that
Jesse be like “Who that?”
Jesse be like “Who that?”
I’m not talking 'bout J. Cole
Jesse sound like a date hoe
Jesse twist sayin' everything

Got a hoe on tha floor givin me a blow job and its so mean
And if I told you who you'd be so confused

Don't mind I'm a hoe king
One line make a hoe dream
One time make a hoe drink

[Outro: Lil Wayne]

And one more thing, suck my dick bitch

[Intro: Charli XCX]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout

[Verse 2: Drew Love]
What you tryna prove?
Who you tryna fool?
I know that a girl like you ain't got no rules
I know girls like you they like to pick and choose
I know what you tryna do
So when I call you better answer, yeah
Oh, 'cause by now you should know what the difference is
Ooh, the difference between me and all them

[Chorus 2: Charli XCX]
Boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout

[Outro]
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they bawl when

[Pre-Chorus: FINNEAS, Billie Eilsh, both]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, both]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, both]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge: FINNEAS, Billie Eilish, both]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 1]
Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about it and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please

[Pre-Chorus]
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to

[Chorus]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Verse 2]
Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited

[Chorus]
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Bridge]
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends can watch me
Today
(Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel)

[Chorus]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Intro: Lil' wayne]

I met her when i was a young bo'
Took her home rolled her up and got my puff on

Baby blue ferrari of tha Nellyville tour
And we could all eat til our belly get full

We signed ta Cash Money, Young Money got rich
Now you see we ball, now you see tha SQAD
We pullin' up in 10 different color bubble cars
I'm on a world tour and don't gotta album
It dont make sense but i make a lotta cabbage
I'm tryna get rich

I rip tha damn show and get head backstage
I'm livin' in tha range, like I'm in a cage
I pull that thang out and send a couple ta yo brains
I don't like tha cops man mothafuckin' Feds
I represent Sqad Up til I'm muthafuckin' dead
A muthafuckin' red stand taller than a muhafuckin' hater Gutta Gutta
What tha fuck up!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

[ Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
I'm thinkin' 22's fa my bitch new Benz

And I'm the DJ I make you say go DJ

[Refrain]
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, a sheet of water
Heat perfusion, search the corners

[Verse 1]
The last oasis is like a fragile flower in a necropolis
Alone in this weather that covers our world
The last oasis is floating like a lost astronaut - Adagio
We have nowhere to go

[Refrain]
Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, a sheet of water
Heat profusion, search the corners

[Verse 2]
The last oasis is the rarest bird that I've ever known
Rara avis is shedding her feathers one at a time
The last oasis wobbles in the desert sands
Standing sentinel in a prison, trapped in our home

[Refrain]
Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain airwaves
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, sheet of water
Heat perfusion, search the corners
Optical illusion, living movements
To be proven, says Zurbuchen

[Verse 3]
The last oasis is like a flag beating in the wind
The world has wasted and the squandered lands are companionless
The last oasis shines a beacon like a lighthouse
Over lonely, countries of death like a black sea ⁣

[Intro]
On my phone

[Verse 1]
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I try to pull the curtains back
Turn you off but can't detach
When all I want and all I know
Is time spent looking at my phone
(On my phone)

[Verse 2]
Find me when the lights go down
Signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home
Find me staring at my phone
I'm wondering where the hours went
As I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow
Time spent looking at my phone

[Chorus]
Last thing that you need
Is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared
Devoured by perverted creatures
Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones
(On my phone)

[Verse 3]
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I call you, you don't call me back
Almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan
Time spent looking at my phone

[Chorus]
Clouds are getting full
So you close all the windows
I would never let you die
Even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need
Is a way to remember
You can never find the time
If you spend everyday looking at your phone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You should come with me
We can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed
And then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again
You can go ahead and stop pretending

[Outro]
Doo doo doo doo doo...

[Intro]
Get ready to have some fun!
Alright, here we go!
Five, four, three, two, and one
Are you ready to work out?

[Verse 1]
Don't take it the wrong way
I can never keep up
Sick of liking your selfies
Should've gone with my gut
Maybe I'm in a movie
Maybe I'm out to lunch
But I'm constantly swiping and tapping
It's never relaxing, I need a new routine

[Chorus]
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(But she works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)

[Interlude 1]
Let's move on to the next step
Og ew ereH
!nuf evah dna esicrexE
Step, touch, step, touch
Perfect form and shape
Come on!
Get on your hands and knees
Ready? Here we go!

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the shitshow
Grab a comfortable seat
Find me in the front row
Facing the music, anyone can see

[Chorus]
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(But she works out too much and)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)

[Interlude 2]
Remember to drink a glass of water before and after you work out
Learn form and shape
Stick with it
Here we go!

[Verse 3]
I'm going off the deep end
Time to let myself go
Nothing's ever as easy as when
It never begins, the end is just a dream

[Chorus Extended]
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(But she works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
We didn't work out, it never works out
No, it never works out
She works out too much
No, I never work out
It didn't work out
No, it never works out

[Outro]
Okay, we're done

[Verse 1]
When you're big
And troubles seem so far
You put your belly up to the bar
Squint your eyes
You can almost miss the dirt
You tell yourself
It couldn't hurt

[Chorus]
But when you're small
You can't walk down the hall
When you're small
You're not very big at all

[Verse 2]
When you're low
You reach a certain point
Where you can't really see the point
You can try
But, you can't see eye to eye
Yet when you're low then you really know

[Bridge]
When you're high
It's easier to fight
When you're high
You don't have to know why

[Chorus]
When you're small
You don't have very far to fall
When you're small
You feel like you belong
When you're small
You can curl into a ball
When you're small
No, you're not very big at all

[Chrous]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I could feel the temperature, temperature

[Verse 1]
I pick you up in a Bentley truck, come outside
Hit me up when you need some downtime
Damn girl, it's about time
Off at 4, I want to see you around 5
Now I'm 4:45, I'll be on my way
Ya I'm on my way come outside
Baby girl, you're never that mine
I lost my watch and I still found time
Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm
When you don't have to force it, it's a force
All I ever want is more

[Chorus]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
And what's left in the love if I gave you all of me, be patient
And when you need space, I give you a spaceship
Take all the space you need yeah
Face your freedom with the face
You still be mine
Before we lay we lie
I get you so wet, would you come clean, oh I

[Chorus]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall, yeah

[Verse 3]
Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm
When you don't have to force it, it's a force
All I ever want is more
And I cannot protect you when you flex so far away
I remember when I met you, the thought of sex was so far away
All I wanted is to talk to you
Thought it would be cool to tell me what I thought of you
You're radiant, you're vibrant
Intelligent, you know I'm nothing like them
I'm more like lightning, you're like fire is frightening

[Chorus]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall

[Intro: Drake & Baka]
Yeah
J–j–j–just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down (yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.k.a. the man, a.k.a. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name

[Chorus: Drake & Baka]
Yah, yah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.k.a it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game
Gyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap, trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—

[Verse 2: Baka]
Hidin' in the racks
I don't pay tax, twelve on my back
Might drive the Caddy around but I never lack
Baka not with the shit? So yeah, who tellin' you that?
I went to jail the day they released Men in Black
When I came out, Timberlake was bringin' Sexy Back
Facts, nigga! Facts!
I fell in love with my strap
Named my son Milli 'cause I want a milli' to stack
Gyah, gyah! Go run and tell that
You niggas move like the cops, don't make me pepper your block
Out the window while the whip's movin', that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX

[Chorus: Baka]
Gyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—

[Intro: Andy Samberg]
They say true love comes only once in a lifetime
And even though we're from opposite ends of the earth
My heart tells me you're the one for me
Mahmoud

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
I remember when it started
Saw you on the news
You were hatin' gays
I was eatin' food
I was feelin' you
And even though I disagree with almost everything you say
You ain't wrong to me
So strong to me
You belong to me
Like a very hairy Jake Gyllenhaal to me
Mahmoud make my heart beat right out of my chest
My mind says no but my body says yes
Nuclear threat, the only threat I see
Is the threat of you not coming home with me
Our love for each other's like when atoms collide
I can't express how I feel
Ayo Adam, let's ride

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
And Iran
Iran so far away
Is your home
But in my heart you'll stay

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg]
He ran for the president of Iran
We ran together to a tropical island
My man Mahmoud is known for wilin'
Smilin', if he can still do it then I can
They call you weasel
They say your methods are medieval
You can play the Jews, I can be your Jim Caviezel
S&M, nestlin' when we're wrestlin'
You could be the port that I park my vessel in
So I try to mute the TV but you can still see me
With your sleepy brown eyes
Butter pecan thighs
And your hairy butt
Yeah

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
And Iran
Iran so far away
Come home
And in my arms you'll stay

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to look at the stars and dream
'Round the world same stars we're seeing
And the twinkle in your eyes, Mahmoud

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
Talk smooth to me
Without a tie
Your pants high-waisted, damn so fly
We could take a trip to the animal zoo
And laugh at all the funny things that animals do
Like Eugene
You got me straight trippin', boo
Hope you look in my eyes and say "I'm trippin' too"
You say Iran don't have the bomb
But they already do
You should know by now
It's you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
And Iran
Iran so far away
Is your home
But in my heart you'll stay

[Outro: Andy Samberg]
You're crazy for this one, Mahmoud
You can deny the Holocaust all you want
But you can't deny that there's something between us
I know you say there's no gays in Iran
But you're in New York now, baby
It's time to stop hiding
And start living

[Intro]
Who dat?
It's the people's champ
Yup, yup
It's the muthafuckin' people's champ
Yeeeaaah come on
Yeah that shit funky right there

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Man I'm sittin' in my man cave, listenin' to beats
Now I'm scrollin' through my Instagram and what do I see?
It's a couple tired rappers, man they hatin' on me
'Cause I'm a fly muthafucka from the LBC
Scoopin' all the girls like nothin' 'cause they fuck wit' my swag
I'm valid like Khaled while securin' the bag
Chevrolet Impalas wit' ass that drag
No skinny jeans, cosag wit' da flag
Later for the small talk, let the big Dogg talk
I taught you how to eat, make beats, and C-walk
Even though you never banged still put you in the gang
Bow down, lil' nigga kiss the pinky ring
I'm your original, this ain't subliminal
What's a bitch-ass nigga to a criminal?
Nothin', you need to quit bluffin'
I promise you softer than a Thomas English Muffin

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
See I came here just to catch you
Right up to yo' face, get at you
And I got that just to let you
See I came here just to catch you
Right up to yo' face, get at you
And I got that just to let you

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now I walk up in the 'hood and they watchin' me close
I'm playin' post, see I'm the king of the coast
I raised a lot of these niggas, I'm plantin' seeds to grow
Told a hunnid-thousand homies how to feed the poor
I'ma catch you, snatch you when you in the set
But I can't 'cause he hidin' behind the internet
Despicable, non-immiscible
What's a student to a principal? Invincible
And disappear for a year like a magician
But come back very visible, 4K baby
The joker's wild, I'm doin' okay baby
Tanqueray Ten wit' a glass of some punch
I'm cookin' wit' Martha, I'll discuss it over lunch
I'm shady with the eighty like Brady the bunch
I'll tap you on the shoulders just to give you a hunch
What's up

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
See I came here just to catch you
Right up to yo' face, get at you
And I got that just to let you
See I came here just to catch you
Right up to yo' face, get at you
And I got that just to let you

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, we do it on the double nigga
We do it on the double nigga
Oh yeah, you in trouble nigga
Doctor Evil, we gon' do this on the double nigga
Yeah, we do it on the double nigga
I like the way you bubble nigga
Bitch-ass nigga, you in trouble nigga
You got it baby, come on
You got it
Yep, yep you got it
I think they got it now
You get it, got it, gone

[Intro]
Cookin'
Cookin'
Can you smell me?

[Verse 1]
Shot down but I levitate
An idle mind starts to contemplate
Razor blades making lifelines
Now I'm staring at an empty plate

[Pre-Chorus]
And it tastes, oh so bitter sweet
And I basically made something to eat, oh

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's what you gotta do, when you gotta stay afloat
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
Popo always come knocking at my door
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
The one thing that I'll never be is broke
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's the realest shit I ever smoked

[Verse 2]
You never know where to find me
Don't use a phone, thank you kindly
Another soldier has fallen
Don't worry, I will catch his body
All the best for your dreams, baby
Say a prayer, get on your knees, baby
Young Lo will make it flip right quick
I'll be God damned if I don't die rich

[Pre-Chorus]
And it tastes, oh, so bitter sweet
And I basically made something to eat, oh

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's what you gotta do, when you gotta stay afloat
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
Popo always come knocking at my door
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
The one thing that I'll never be is broke
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's the realest shit I ever smoked

[Bridge]
When it comes to this, no one is better at this than me
When it comes to this, no one is better at this than me
I flick my wrist, flick my wrist, flick my wrist just once
I flick my wrist, flick my wrist, flick my wrist just once

[Pre-Chorus]
And it tastes, oh, so bitter sweet
And I basically made something to eat, oh

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's what you gotta do, when you gotta stay afloat
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
Popo always come knocking at my door
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
The one thing that I'll never be is broke
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's the realest shit I ever smoked

[Intro: DMX]
Yeah, uh, man
Thanks for the love and support baby, thank you
I hate you

[Verse 1: DMX]
Hate who I love, blessed with the curse
I was born to die, best of the worst
Wings but can't fly, but first things first
I will until I'm stretched in a hearse
Niggas don't get me, but I ain't complicated
Thing about the truth is most niggas hate it
Didn't ask God for what I wanted, I waited
Until He felt like I earned it, then he gave it
Anything worth havin' is worth earnin'
The true nature of man is definitely worth learnin'
'Cause why you're concerning yourself with discernment
Whether its worth savin', its usually worth burnin'
I knew from the start that this life wasn't mine
That's why from the start, I put my life on the line
Gangstas runnin' 'round cryin' about dyin'
I got faith, I'ma go when its my time!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
How many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 4: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "What's up, fam? Hope you good"
You say, "I'm good, I'm great," the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Six shit
Ayy, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Six, nigga, Dedication 6, nigga
Six, nigga, six, nigga, Dedication 6, nigga
Six, nigga, sick nigga, sick, six shit, nigga

[Verse 1: Euro & Lil Wayne]
I hear y'all new shit and I cringe (I cringe)
Your girlfriend likes me and my friends (My friends)
If we hit it, that oui is not French (Not French)
I'm anti-social, pardon my tints (My tints)
We left E11even, at 11 AM (Yeah)
Raw papers full of peace, cups full of mayhem (Yeah)
We all wavy, I'm just sort of on a different wavelength (Yeah)
See, they more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans (Woo)
Being the greatest ever is my destiny still (Okay)
Since a child, I focused on my Kelly, Bey, and Michelle (Okay)
Sitting back, getting head from a mademoiselle (Okay)
Tryin' to put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will (Amen)
Dedicated to you for the sixth time
Killed it on the fifth one, now they say I'm big-time
While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega (Yuh), my uncle had a pager (Chirp!)
I knew this drug kingpin that tried to run for Mayor (Skrrt!)
Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player
If she bad then I upgrade her, get her unlimited data (Blrrp!)
They tryin' to build a wall, man, my dogs gon' hate that shit
And build underground railroads so the Maybachs fit, yeah
We in the game, but we don't play that shit
Cover your soul before they take that shit—Young!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Right nigga, wrong nigga, dope nigga, ill nigga
Rich nigga, Polo nigga, house bigger, bills bigger
Sick nigga, Hill nigga, lit nigga, chill nigga
Racks nigga, real bigger, Shaq-bigger, lil nigga
Facts nigga, trill nigga, tax nigga, still, nigga
Coke-on-coke, nigga—slopes, niggas, hills, nigga
Joke, nigga? Nope, nigga, clip bigger, quick trigger
Thick strippers, I ain't into stick figures, mixed signals
O.J. with the brick, nigga runnin' through the white
Nigga, O.J. on my wrist, nigga, that's Sunny Delight
Nigga, diamonds in my teeth, shining like some pearly whites
Nigga straight from New Orleans, like a plate of dirty rice
Nigga bought a lot of art, and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Beat around the bush right after we beat the court case
Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the motherfuckin' horse race
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her, keep her mouth shut; if not, I got some Scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe, referring to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake, it make you do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown, light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got the right time; you ask him, he say, "Time'll tell"
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think that I care
Some niggas got a iPhone, some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm watching out for myself
Tattoos, black skin, red eyes, blonde hair
Lyin' there, lookin' like "Aww, yeah", lawn chair
Jumped right off the Con-Air and landed on a timeshare
I wear Versace eyewear, feelin' like top shelf
Cool as two Ls and Rock Bells, hot as Scottsdale
Bombshell, ugh

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yo
Bow! Yeah, blackin' out, blackin' out
We on the drugs, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out, blackin' out
All the guns, black it out, black it out, black-black-black it out
On the run, actin' out, actin' out, actin' out, yuh
That's some sick shit

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Brooklyn Myrtle Ave. is her birth place
Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on all her worst days
I used to take the train with her so none of these lames get her
The danger of livin' from where she was at was a plain picture
I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen, she kinda just blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured everybody want riches and of course
But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced
Early, her papa, he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her
'Stead she gave her to her uncle, her brother who played the savior
'Til the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing
And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move
'Fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem to exit or quit it, the feeling was there
Started talkin' lower as she told me come here
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill
And said, she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Figured that this intimidation was the worst case
She sat back and blew six in that boy face *gun shots*
Shot, him, dead

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure, he told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and now wants to know this
To find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt, it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know him, but take this part in
When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
A woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him
"Don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you
And if somebody do then all they would hear was the baka-baka-baka-baka"
One day, he was on the block rollin'
Then, this crack fiend woman came to him, told him
That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, "Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye came from when you was four
When you fell off in the road"
At that point, he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
She says to him, "I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you"
His mom says to him, "I hope you know your pop was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop but everything I'm sayin' fails
You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn where we would leave ya, uh
I know she love you but the story's more deeper, uh
You see, your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
Used to leave her so confused she would lace her own coke and reefer
Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure who's the nigga
Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga? When your cousin is the reason he got shot, nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga"
His anger was dwellin' all on his mind
He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his .9
And uh, before he knew it, he aimed it up at his mom
And uh, huh- *gun shots* -he shot her right in the spine
He said, "This is why my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'?
This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind
I know that I'ma die but in Heaven, I'll be alive" *gun shot*

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped on
Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on
Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy
A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby
How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break? Love turn to hate?
Fuck shit or fake, your next move may raise the murder rate
From average to savage, to semi-automatics
It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it *gun shot*

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely

[Chorus]
Wanna see you wind it
I'ma get up behind it
Loving the way you shake it like that
Don't be shy, girl, go off
Go and do it like it's nobody around
Baby, just show off
You gotta do it when you got it like that, go off

[Verse]
I ain't gon' make you do something you don't wanna do
All I want you to do is take your time, right here right now
I know you feel it, trust me girl' I feel it too
If you get a lil' crazy, it's alright
And I'm hoping that you don't mind how I'm looking at you moving
You got me thinking about your thighs and lifting up your legs
Just wait a minute, girl
One more time just do that dance, just do that dance
Girl, that booty 'bout to make a nigga fall in love
You coming home with me when we leave the club, but first off

[Chorus]
Wanna see you wind it
I'ma get up behind it
Loving the way you shake it like that
Don't be shy, girl, go off
Go and do it like it's nobody around
Baby, just show off
You gotta do it when you got it like that, go off
Go off, go off
You gotta do it when you got it like that, go off
Wanna see you wind it
I'ma get up behind it
Loving the way you shake it like that
Don't be shy, girl, go off
Go and do it like it's nobody around
Baby, just show off
You gotta do it when you got it like that, go off
Go off, go off

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Again?
Again?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
Again?

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back

[Verse 2]
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out

[Chorus]
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out

[Outro]
I'll sit and watch your car
Watch your car
Never let you
Watch your car, watch your car
Burn
Watch your car, watch your car
Never let you
Burn
I'll sit and watch your car
Watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car
Watch your car, watch your car

[Verse 1]
I wanna be alone
Alone with you - does that make sense? (Hello?)
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
When you're with me and we're alone

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Could roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes

[Verse 1]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind

When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Outro]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the t.v. on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Tomorrow I'll wake up do some p90x
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out this is great
I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops you'll just have to wait
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
No I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No no no no no no no no no oh
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo

Nothing at all

[Verse 1]
Jumped down the well
Found just your shell
You’ll find yourself
I’ll fix myself

[Verse 2]
But if your sentences are short
Oh, you’ll have to clear your throat
Let the devil through the door
Call yourself a young adult
Seems like all the ones you lost
Were the ones you asked to stay
Best to pick apart your thoughts
Before they do to you the same

[Bridge]
Walk past the truth
Don’t look for clues
Trust only blue
Trust only blue

[Verse 3]
Though it’s not pleasant to feel
It’s the only thing that’s real
Any comfort you can get
Is one that you won’t regret
As the sunlight turns to dust
I’ll try to resist the rust
The only knife that doesn’t hurt
Is the knife that you don’t touch

[Chorus]
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few (Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few (Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few (Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few (Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few)

[Chorus]
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You will never have to be true ‘till the roses rot
And if you’re tripping up, you’ll see soon the ground’s kinda soft
And there is always something to do ‘till you blow it off
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few
Pretty are the simple few, the simple few, the simple few few few

[Instrumental]

Go down
Soft sound
Midnight
Car lights
Playing with the air
Breathing in your hair
Go down
Soft sound
Step into your skin? I'd rather jump in your bones
Taking up your mouth so you breathe through your nose

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Please welcome my favourite band, The 1975!

[Verse 1]
Hey! Would you like to look outside sometimes? (No!)
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change!
(OH! Yeah)
Next thing you'll find you're reading about yourself on a plane, fame, what a shame!
OH! Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you want to do, oh (Yeah? No.)
And love me 

[fancy me] (Yeah)
If that's what you want to do (Oh. Yeah? No.)

[Verse 2]
You've been reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache
And a bag of bash for passion
She got a beautiful face but got nothing to say, oh!
Yeah, I'm telling ya, I think about that.....
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah?! No!

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
How are you fucking feeling London!

[Chrous]
I said love me (Yeah, oh yeah)
If that's what you want to do (Oh. Yeah? No.)
Love me (love me, yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh. Yeah? No.)

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Thank you.... one...

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh so sack off your calendar, give it to the people!
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, OHH!"

[Chorus]
I said love me, yeah
Shut up, oh yeah! (Oh)
I said love me, love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah?)
One, two, three, four!

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Welcome to the show, everyone. This is the biggest thing that we've ever done. We wanted to play some songs. For all the people that mean that we can be here this evening. So we're gonna go deep

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Before you go, turn the big light off
(Please don't go) Before you go, turn the big light off
(Please don't go) Before you go, turn the big light off
(Please don't go) Before you go, turn the big light off

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Early, early
Early, early
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Matthew Healy + audience]
Hey boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
"Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself," baby
Oh, it's just a simple diuretic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize
That I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize
That I, I'm not giving it up again

[Bridge]
The kick won't last for long
But the song only lasts 3 minutes
I think I've lost my phone
So won't you call it up for me?
The kick won't last for long
But the song only lasts 3 minutes
And I know it's wrong
But give me one

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize
That I, I'm not giving it up again (ohh-oh-ohh)

[Outro]
I'm not giving it up
Oh, I'm not giving it up, hey!
Oh, I'm not giving it up
I'm not giving it up, ohh-ohhh
Oh, I'm not giving it up, oh yeah (Giving it up)
I'm not giving it up, giving it up

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
One! Two! One, two three, go!

[Verse 1]
Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beat I made for two

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said, "It's nice to have your friends 'round
We're watching the television with no sound"

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Oh my god, london...

[Verse 2]
Push your lack of chest out
"Look at my hair!"
Gotta love the way you love yourself
"Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection of your mental health"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends 'round
You created a television of your mouth

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Bridge]
You got something to say?
Why don't you speak it out loud, instead of living in your head?
It's always the same
Why don't you take your heart out, instead of living in your head?

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Ah yeah, now we're going London

[Saxophone solo]

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
Alright
Why don't you figure out....

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
I was about to say this. Good evening, The O2

London. London, we played here last night. Tonight, tonight was the first show that sold out

I loved last night. I loved it with all of my heart, it was one of the best parts of the night. But this is hard core

I want to feel as close as possible because this is fucking massive

Alright, let's just sing songs together

"A Change of Heart."

[Instrumental]

Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

[Matthew Healy + audience]
I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You got it. Let's go

[Instrumental interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"

[Matthew Healy + audience]
You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh, I just had a change of heart

Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'"
Oh, I just had a change of heart

I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
{Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come he... come here

*kisses Chris*

I like Chris, though. I like Chris. He's my (*chuckling*) friend. He's my friend

*sigh* Now, *shush*. Everyone shush. Fuck me, I'm gonna sit down. Can you all see...? I know some of you can't see me. How are you feeling? You feeling good?

Good. I am.... I feel like.. th-this obviously for me, for us, is incredibly special. I mean, there's a lot, there's a lot of people here. And... it blows our mind. And I think the... there's an element of me that wants to really, I dunno, preserve the purity of why we're here, 'cause you're all.... here for the..., you're all here to see our band. So you're all here for same reason, which is fucking cool. Loads of people in the same place for the same reason. And, umm.... And, I just think it's important that we're all here together for a little bit

I'm gonna stand up so you can see me so you can understand that I'm sincere when I say this

It's just that I feel.... And I don't say this a lot on tour, because I'm... I'm always on tour, we're always on tour. And I feel like I live my life like a fucking forum, like.... like I'm "Hey, I don't know that you feel that" and everything you do is subject to discussion and debate and you validate your experiences by documenting them and I'm just as bad as anybody as soon as I see anything that I find... beautiful or interesting or good. I just think, "Right, I need to.... get my fucking phone out and take a picture of that." So I really, I empathize on that feeling like, "You. Go there, now." I know what it's like

I don't... ohh, I didn't mean to shout you out at your little face. I'm so sorry

*chuckles* I.. but, but what I'm saying is that I do that as well, right? But let's just, for five minutes, look.... if we can get every person in here just to be a fucking person for five minutes.....

And that's not me being grumpy. I'm just saying, trust me, right? The memory, the visceral memory of the next three-and-a-half minutes will be better than a video on your iPhone
And if you want to film it, that's fine, but you're missing out

And let's play, "fallingforyou."

I need some more wine

[Verse 1]
What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right if you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need is my bike and your enormeous house
You said some day we might
When I'm closer to your height, till then we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

[Chorus]
Don't you see me, I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me, I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind

[Verse 2]
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again, again
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon, you will be mine, oh, but I want you now, I want you now
When the smoke is in your eyes, you look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? Maybe
'Cos you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't want to be your friend, I want to kiss your neck

[Chorus]
Don't you see me, I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me, I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Aight, let's take it back

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Ok, we're going now, we're going now, we're going back

How are you feeling on this side? How are you feeling on this side?

Everybody, let's play it here, one, two....

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and 'fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 1]
It's going off 'cos they're not gonna let him in
2 and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and 'fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 2]
A broken half, a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, 'It's my car I'm sleeping in'

[Bridge: Matthew Healy + audience]
Tabs with unlimited O's
New clothes, bloody nose
Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed?
No, broken phone
Retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him

[Verse 3]
'I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place'
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes, I threw a nut, but your friend's a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
'Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about'

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
I see it....
Hey, how's it going there?

[Outro]
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E –
M-O-N-E –
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
She had a face straight out a magazine
God only knows but you’ll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
When she gets his gun, he’s begging, 'Babe stay, stay, stay, stay, stay'

[Hook 1]
I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know you?

[Verse 2]
Ooh, now if you never shoot, you’ll never know
And if you never eat, you’ll never grow
You’ve got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home
She's begging you to stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

[Hook 1]
'I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, ‘cause I know you'

[Bridge: Matthew Healy and audience]
Well, now that you’ve got your gun
It’s much harder now the police have come
And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you just take off your mask
You'd find out everything’s gone wrong

{Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Right, now sing it

Now everybody’s dead
And they’re driving past my old school
And he’s got his gun, he’s got his suit on
She says, 'Babe, baby, you look so cool'

You look so cool
You look so cool, cool, cool, cool (cool, cool)
You look so cool, you look so cool (cool)
You look so cool (so), cool, (cool) cool, cool, cool

[Verse 1]
Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

Yeah, slow down, yeah, I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
Oh, she starts talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, do it!

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, this truly is remarkable for all of us, thank you so much for coming

How're you dong? Now, let's go

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Yeah, yeah. Let's keep it going

It's thanks

[Verse 1]
Twist around the lounge
Sun drowns the house
Stick another pill in my head and go to bed
We're not doing it again so leave it

[Chorus]
(Ooh)I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Verse 2]
Bombs have run out
Call 'round the town
"I could hear you giving her head," she said
You think we're doing it again keep dreaming

[Chorus]
(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl 

[ohh]) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl 

[ohh]) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Fuck politics. Let's do some dancing

[Verse 1]
Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look! He's having a breakdown
Oh, what a let down, a shame, I think he might die!"
And now she's dancing, enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn (Oh yeah)
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said I've got a lot to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

[Chorus]
And if she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)
And if she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)

[Verse 2]
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun, divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Let me hear you

And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

[Chorus]
And if she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American, she's American
And if she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Let's go!

[Bridge]
Oh, well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant

[Chorus]
And if she likes it cause we just don't eat, yeah
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)
And if she likes it cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
And if she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (she's American)

[Instrumental]

And he said "I've lost my head
Can you see it? Can you see it?"
Belly aches while you're in bed
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Instrumental]

And he said "I've lost my head
Can you see it? Can you see it?"
Belly aches while you're in bed
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

[Instrumental]
{Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie, lie....)
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body

[Verse 2]
C'mon baby (I know)
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face (c'mon baby)
C'mon baby (I know)
You said you'd find someone to take my place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep "doin' it" and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London!

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body, I don't want your body (hey!)
I don't want your body, I don't want your body
I don't want your body (now, let's do it), I don't want your body (this side!)

[Bridge: Matthew Healy + audience]
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love? (ah)
Get someone you need? (You got it)
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love? (Everybody)
Get someone you need? (Lemme hear you)

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Hey!

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, I want to hear you sing it. Give me it!

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else (alright)
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Ok, now we'll keep the accent, let's do it

[Outro]

Thank you, Chris. Chris. Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris. Hold on, Chris. It's fine now

Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me get my shit together
Now I got my shit together, yeah, yeah

I'm so sorry but it's over now
The pain is gone

[Chorus]
I'm putting on my shades to cover up my eyes
I'm jumping in my ride, I'm heading out to

Feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine

Yeah, I'm solo, I'm riding solo

[Verse 2]
Yeah, now I'm feeling how I should

Back in the game, who knew I would, oh
So fly how I spread my wings
Loving myself makes me wanna sing, oh
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me get my shit together

Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah
Solo, solo
Woah, yeah

[Intro]
What if? Oh, woah

[Verse 1]
If you are the one
Then us meeting here is fate, uh
Future with a dog named Ben
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know that this might sound crazy
'Cause you don't know my name

[Chorus]
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
Baby, what if
Doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if

[Verse 2]
Picture me on one knee
With the perfect diamond ring (perfect diamond ring)
We just met, but if you say, "Yes"
We'd have our wedding on the beach (oh)
It could happen, raise three kids
And we grow old, oh, so happily
I know this may sound crazy
'Cause I don't know your name

[Chorus]
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
Baby, what if
Doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if

[Bridge]
Don't know what tomorrow brings but I'm still hoping
That you are the one for me
Oh and what if I had you and what if you had me and
Baby, what's the reason we can't fall in love?
What if
What if
What if, oh, woah

[Chorus]
What if (what if)
What if (what if)
What if, oh, oh
But we can't, we can't tell the future, no
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
Baby, what if
Doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Yeah, baby, what if
But we can't (we can't), we can't tell the future, no (oh)
But that's just, the beauty of the world we know
Singing oh, doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if
Doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo
Baby, what if

[Intro]
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want
Give it up, shorty
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Interlude]
Oh, Jason Derulo

[Verse 1]
Like a shock to my heart
When I saw you tonight
Like a dream come alive
For the very first time
When we touch in the dark
Baby, you're blowing my mind
Wish I could freeze you and me
In this moment in time (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want
Give it up, shorty
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher
Than I've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

[Verse 2]
When we dance, when we kiss
Doesn't get any better than this
How you shine, trapped in the spotlight
Finally mine, yeah
Baby, let's go (go), let's get out of here
Baby, let go (go), got nothing to fear
And now that we're here, let's disappear
Into the night (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want (what I want)
Give it up, shorty (shorty)
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher
Than I've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

[Bridge]
My feet are on the ceiling, haha (the ceiling)
And they don't wanna touch the ground anymore
Oh, what I feel (what I feel), I can feel it (I can feel it)
Can you feel it? Feel It, feel it (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher (oh, yeah)
Than I've ever been before (before), my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
"What is all this?" You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-mart, buy me my peach lip gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

[Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

[Verse 2]
Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all ways he used to let up
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

[Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

[Outro]
Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Let's do "Paris"!

[Verse 1]
She said 'hello', she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
And I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a great coat"

And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends"

[Chorus]
Oh-ohh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
How I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 2]
Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"

[Chorus]
Ya know, how I'd love to go to Paris again
How I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 3]
"Oh stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls"
"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh, uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man, you putting me up on a shelf
"Well, I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"

And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene,"
But I was picking up from Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it!

And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London!

[Verse 1: Matthew Healy + audience]
Bite your face to spite your nose

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
What's that?

17 and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where’s the fun in doing what you're told?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "No!"
'Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned 18 year old
Give me a night I'll make you'
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Verse 2]
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh, she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with 30-year-olds and you think you've made it"
'Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?'
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

[Chorus]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Sing it!

[Bridge: Audience]
I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I’ll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you"
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior"
'Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?'
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts (girls)
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it!

[Matthew Healy + audience]
They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
Let's dance everybody! (They're just girls)
One, two, three, prove it

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Let's fucking have it!

And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah, my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

Said use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She said, what?
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Got a boyfriend anyway

I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Got a boyfriend anyway
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no
You say no

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Alright London, let's fuck it up! One! Two! One, two, three!

[Instrumental]

Now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Got a boyfriend anyway

And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything, we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
Got a boyfriend anyway

You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway

[Ambience]

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say bye-bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how can I refuse?
Yeah, you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're a medicine)
Yeah, you're a medicine
(You're a medicine)

[Verse 2]
I, I wanna marry you
Said I, I adore you
And that's all I have to say bye-bye
And you opiate this hazy head of mine

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're a medicine)
Yeah, you're a medicine
(You're a medicine)
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're a medicine)
Yeah, you're a medicine
Yeah, you're a medicine, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I’ve got a God shaped hole that’s infected
And I’m petrified of being alone now
It's pathetic, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I Lostmyhead (Lostmyhead)

[Chorus]
And if I believe you
Will that make it stop?
If I told you I need you
Is that what you want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help (There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking you Jesus, show yourself

[Verse 2]
I thought I’d met you once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be your child if you insist
I mean if it was you that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I’m a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
One, two, oh....

[Chorus]
And if I believe you
Will that make it stop?
If I told you I need you
Is that what you want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help (There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking you Jesus, go play it baby (show yourself)

[Saxophone solo]

[Outro: Matthew Healy + choir]
If I'm lost, then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost, then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now, then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost
If I'm lost
If I'm lost
If I'm lost
If I'm lost
If I'm lost

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Call it a split cause you know that you will
You bite your friends like like chocolate
We go where nobody knows
Guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna quit it
And we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, London everyone!

[Chorus]
We go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Post-Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it, why?
That's what she said
Dressed in black, head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Verse 2]
We're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
OH, my hair smells like chocolate
Now, you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it
Got get it, go get it, go!
And play it cool

[Chorus]
Oh, we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
Well, I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You still with us, London?

Let's go! One, two, three!

[Chorus]
Oh, we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
Well, I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go, hey!

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, thank you so much for making this such an incredible, special evening for us. We've only just fucking started!

[Intro: Choir + Matthew Healy]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart (We'll see you next year.)
Let's go! One, two!

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + choir and audience]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it!

Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby, won't you cum again?
She said "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"
Let's go!

[Pre-Chorus: Choir + Audience]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you "just don't get it"

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London!

Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
There's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
And you say I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, one more time! Let's go!

Cause I know you

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, one last time

If you're on the floor, if you're in heaven, if you're on the side, it doesn't matter. I need everyone to jump up and down and count to four
One! Two! One, two, fucking jump!

[Guitar solo: Adam Hann]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy + audience]
One! Two! One, two, three!

Hey London, let's go!

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London!

Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
One more time!

Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Good night!

*stage glitches and, after a while, turns off*

*applause*

[Ambience]
Another night has quickly turned to day
And the faces went from colorful to gray
For now the fiendish have come out to play
Thoughts are racing and pace none can say

I was under the impression that we all had learned our lesson
But the questions still remain
I guess I'll join to help the time go by
But my bones and brains are living out of psi

I pull my hair back and take one big sigh
I forget to give a fuck about the "why"
I've been swallowed by illusion and the counterable confusions over using out to dry

I've been swallowed by illusion
I've been swallowed by illusion
I've been swallowed by illusion
I've been swallowed by illusion

The ticks have tocked and all the love's been shared
While the clock's given up it's right to care
The party's losing track of when and where
While all the mum's and dad's are pulling out their hair
I'm a hump from institution, you're a skip from black and blue son
But the truth ones never fair

Pulling out my hair
Say another prayer
Blissful but aware
Sinking deeper inside of this chair
Pulling out my hair
Say another prayer
Blissful but aware
Sinking deeper inside of this chair

I'm crumbling, I'm paper thin, 'a stumbling
I'm crumbling, ya' paper thin, 'a crumbling
Ya' stumbling, paper thin
Ya' stumbling, ya' stumbling

I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to say
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to say
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to say
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to do
I don't know what I am to say
To say
I don't know
'say I don't know
'say I don't know-oh
Lordy, you're so ruthless
But I'll tell you what the truth is, if you fair
Serpent like the skin and everything i feel so ashamed to wear
Lordy, you're so ruthless
But I'll tell you what the truth is, if you fair
Serpent like the skin and everything i feel so ashamed to wear
More than disarray, more than disarray, more than disarray
More than disarray
Holdin' on by a delicate thread
Certainly I know I'm already dead
I'm spinnin' round, all the blood to my head
Aimlessly I circle, glad my mind's so fertile

I feel my space from the ground to the floor
It's like the hunting cars and a million more
They stand with their guns to my core
Never pull the trigger, still they firmly linger

I roll my eyes as they're cockin' their guns
They march around like they've got and won
But little do they know that it's all for fun
Chop like a propeller, choppin' up his fellas

Just let me spin some blood on things
The guns be by again
Just let me spin some blood on things
The guns be by
Just let me spin some blood on things
The guns be by again
Just let me spin some blood on things
The guns be by
I circle 'round so slowly
Watch me slowin', where ya' going? What's the hold up?
I always watch my back
You're too busy, gettin' dizzy, won't you grow up?
Fall from this string and pulley
Watch me get above the shelter, why ya' smelter
You lose your cool so fast
Great solution, no confusion, wipe yo' wet ones
I circle 'round so slowly
Watch me slowin', where ya' going? What's the hold up?
I always watch my back
You're too busy, gettin' dizzy, won't you grow up?
Fall from this string and pulley
Watch me get above the shelter, why ya' smelter
You lose your cool so fast
Great solution, no confusion, wipe yo' wet ones

Cut the string for it's time to drop
There's quite a massive gleam, but I've got my mom
I can't prepare for these spins to stop
Question if you're ready, guns are getting heavy

Your steady march helps the time go by
But certainly I know that the cost is right
Getting tired of this perfect time
Find another drummer, pick another number
Just let me spin some blood on things
Their guns be by again
Just let me spin some blood on things
Their guns be by

[Verse 1]
You the one always saying, I don't treat you right, babe
Don't wanna go out and dance like we used to
Don't wanna Netflix and chill
Girl, you never in the mood (No)
Your phone stay on vibrate
Baby, who the hell calling this late?
Every other day the story changes
If you ain't really gonna love me, baby, I can leave
'Cause I done been hurt, I'm too weak for, how you gon' be mine if he's yours? (Skrrt skrrt)
Baby, you done took a detour, it's fucking me up
Tell the truth if you can't do it, got me out here looking stupid
Tell the truth (Tell me), you gave it to him easily (What the fuck?)

[Chorus]
I try to drink away the misery
Too drunk, too angry
Gotta come clean to figure it out
She cheated, I know it
Too drunk, too angry
Girl, that shit fucked up I can't believe it  (Girl, you played me)
Think you can lie, you gotta pick a side, him or me?
Who do you love? Him or me?
Gotta be, him-him-him, him or me?
Better pick the right one, she cheated, him or me?
Who do you love? She cheated
Gotta be me, oh, I know it
Better pick the right one
Girl, that shit fucked up I can't believe it
Him-him-him, him or me?

[Verse 2]
When you played with my heart, I heard a melody
Right now I ain't see, puzzles, tryna find the pieces
Everything you said I did, you did to me with this other guy, no
You know he don't got you like I do (He don't, he don't)
Don't refuse, this gift I got for you, deep down, girl, I know
Guess I didn't give you enough attention (No)
Guess I ain't tagged you enough and tell your business (Woo!)
Don't even lie, we been talked about children
You said you weren't ready and I'm too crazy to have kids
She said I should live in the moment
Told me, "Don't put too much on it"
Told me, "Don't put too much on it"
Your phone stay on vibrate, what the fuck? (No, no)

[Chorus]
I try to drink away the misery
Too drunk, too angry
Gotta come clean to figure it out (Oh)
She cheated (You cheated on me), I know it
Too drunk, too angry (Too drunk)
Girl, that shit fucked up I can't believe it (Can't believe it, girl, you played me)
Think you can lie, you gotta pick a side, is it him or me?
Who do you love? (Ooh) Him or me?
Gotta be, him-him-him, him or me?
Better pick the right one, she cheated, him or me? (You did)
Who do you love? She cheated
Gotta be me, oh, oh I know it
Better pick the right one
Girl, that shit fucked up I can't believe it
Him-him-him, him or me?

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Me and Benjamín Franco stay at the banco
Getting checks like Nike, everywhere that I go
If you ain't getting no pesos, ¿qué estás haciendo? (J-Lo)
Stack it up like Legos, quiero dinero (Another one)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Me and my man, we stack it up to the ceiling (More money)
Cállate la boca, let me finish (More money)
Every day I’m alive, I make a killing (Let's get it)
Yeah, I swear I'ma get it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled]
Soy la Princesa, San Juan, Puerto Rico
They say money talk, but my talking bilingual
I should be cuffed, though, ’cause I don't do singles
In love with the money, so no need to mingle (Let's ride)
Just back it up, hot talk, yeah, back it up
Holla at that if you actin' up
You ain't got that, you can't sit with us, yeah
Designer frames make you double take
Ben and Andy on a double date
Grant just hit me, said he on the way

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the Cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento (Cardi B)

[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Look, they gon' do what I say so, Cardi B and J. Lo
Talk behind my back, but never up in my face, though
I just want my money, chips, guap, and queso
Y'all can kiss my ass, dame un beso
Dominicana, drippin’ in designer
I got the juice, no Tropicana
I got the box that got the most flavor
Big fat cat like in the bodegas
Still making money moves (Yeah)
Tell me what you think (Yeah)
Merengue to the money (Woo)
Bachata to the bank (Oww)
I spice it up, I’m like sofrito
I need my money, yo necesito
I told y'all, I’m trap Selena
I'll backhand a bitch like Serena
We need the guap, run up in your spot
Put it to your head like, "Give me what you got"
Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx
Cardi from the pole and Jenny from the block (Block)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & DJ Khaled, Both]
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero
Dinero, di- (Dinero)
I just want the dinero, di- (Dinero)
I just want the dinero, dinero
I just want the dinero, dinero
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
Yo quiero, yo quiero dinero, ay
I just want the green, want the money, want the cash flow
Yo quiero la venta, sí, sin cuenta, sí, lo siento

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Me and Benjamín Franco stay at the banco
Getting checks like Nike, everywhere that I go
If you ain't getting no pesos, ¿qué estás haciendo?
Stack it up like Legos, quiero dinero

[Verse 1]
Lonely Jones
He never leaves his home
Because the moment he opens the door he loses the breath that he had right before
That's why he's a Lonely Jones

[Verse 2]
Motorbike
It don't take him where he'd like
Because the moment that he turns the key he gets afraid of the sights he might see
Too bad for that motorbike

[Verse 3]
Walks past the mailbox to the end of the street
Maybe this isn't so bad
Makes his way up to the girl of his dreams
Wakes up feeling so sad
Too bad

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
But his goulashes look worse in the light
But he moves on instead in the dark of the night
And in spite of the words spinning round in his head
You're better off living
Don't act like you're dead
No, don't be such a Lonely Jones
There's a big log cabin high above the junction
Near a broken down roller coaster park
There's a mountain breach high above the creek
Where i'll be hanging up some Christmas lights tonight

Now I know oh oh o oh
This is all I've ever wanted to call my own
But I don't know oh oh o oh
This is all that I need

Soon I'll come again
Running among under the moon
Soon I'll need a friend living the life of an
Abominable Snowman

There's a roaring thunder
Miles among the tundra, there's pack of wolfs
Singing songs beside a fire

There's a faucet leak
To give the pipes some heat
There's an Avalanche I'll be surfing tonight
Now I know oh oh o oh
This is all I've ever wanted to call my own
But I don't know oh oh o oh
This is all that I need

Soon I'll come again
Running among under the moon
Soon I'll need a friend living the life of an
Abominable Snowman
Each Sunday morning at breaking of day
A most lovely creature she passes my way
I stand at my window to catch her eye
But her head never turns as she passes me by

Bella Rosa, Bella Rosa
What is this feeling that harms me so
Bella Rosa, Bella Rosa
Soon you must love me or let me go

As I wander around through the country side
There's many a girl that would be my bride
But always before the vows I can say
Her image returns and she draws me away

Bella Rosa, Bella Rosa
What is this feeling that harms me so
Bella Rosa, Bella Rosa
Soon you must love me or let me go

[Intro]
Boys, boys, boys

Don't forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot, hot, hot...
Let's go!

[Bridge]
I'm not loose, I like to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic

Love it when you call me legs
In the morning buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together
Boys like you love me forever

Boys, boys, boys
Boys, boys, boys

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ahem
I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3 was the first mixtape you heard when we had a Black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome
A Dedication

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got Doja, Narcotics, and Actavis; that's DNA
Got a Dyke-ho, Nympho, And your bitch layin' next to me and bae
Eazy like NWA, they make me feel A-OK
Feeling like Tony, "Grr-rr-reat!"; feeling all on me, TSA
She got Dollars, Nut, and Alcohol all over her T&A
She snort all this KKK, and this broad need AAA
Let's enjoy some NBA, y'all lil boys NCAA
Yeah we got A-M-M-O, but you'll get beat like MMA
I got Dracos, Ninos, Automatics; that's my DNA
You'll get beat like Sugar Ray, TKO, O-H-H
I smoke O's, I sip Ace, I pop whole Xanies straight
I got P's, I got weight, I got kis, I got gates
I got moonrock, molly, ecstasy, inside this weed, it's laced
I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Zhané, Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like "thin line between love and hate"
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!), now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey
Now it's Bumbu by the case, nigga, fuck you, fly away
Six shit, (blrrrp)

[Break: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
Dedicated
To the culture that Tunechi birthed
To the sons and daughters of Weezy
Y'all niggas still watching a master at work
I already got...
D6

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I already got the Ganja
I already got the Fanta
All black like Uganda
Hair back like E. Honda, wait
Hardhat like a condom
Your skull crack, then we crowned you
Shark bite to a flounder
Bar fight to a bouncer, wait
All Franks like Sinatra
Face been painted, they ain't never clowned him
Everybody rakin' cash like it's autumn
Y'all boys sweeter than Whatchamacallit
All y'all take a seat on this toilet
Y'all ain't shit, but y'all piss-poor, and
Sittin' in the foreign like I'm on a Harley
Keep bloodsuckers away with the garlic
Alone in a mansion, I'm Macaulay Culkin
Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waitin' on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter
Damn, I wish I was a lil bit taller
Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
Smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward

[Verse]
Everything was meant, everything was meant
I took a L, what comes after L? My nigga — Ms
That AK with the twins, that's Mary Kate and sis
My shooters, they don't miss; fade away, then swish
Dedication 6, and every day we sick
Treatin' medication scrips like some Revelation scripts
I thought yesterday we quit
But you know, every day we spent
Then we celebrate the win like we'll never play again
Lord I just talked to my hitman, he say that he made a list
Nigga always breakin' in, and he never leave a print
And I never shaved a brick, OK, now I'm talkin' shit
Where that bakin' soda mix? Raise my Arm & Hammer fist
And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like "Where that safe at, bitch?"
Put that barrel to her tits, and if she hesitate, that's it
I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin
You know every day we win, you know second place ain't shit
You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six
While you eatin' bacon grits again while police takin' tips
You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched
This that Dedication 6, you know every day we sick
Give me wet, a life, a gift, catch a body like the Lyft
This that Dedication 6, if she starstruck, make a wish
I tell her pussy "Take your lick", I'm big-headed, make it fit
You know every day we sick

[Outro: Lil Wayne & DJ Drama]
That's some sick shit, yeah
Shoutout Young Money!
You know every day we sick
That's some sick shit, oh
My nigga Mack Maine
And that's that Dedication 6
You know every day we sick
And you are just a patient, bitch
It's that Dedication 6
You know every day we sick
And that's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
You know every day we sick

[Intro: Gudda Gudda]
Take that shit off at the front
Gudda! Lord
Uh-oh

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda & (Lil Wayne)]
Sleep on me, I hope you die in your sleep
No one's defiant as me
I know my worth, so when you pay me
Just know that I am not cheap (I am not cheap)
On the road to riches
Tappin' my horn, so watch for the beep (watch for the beep)
Rippin' this shit to pieces
No, I will not look out for the beat
Started out on the block
Got on my feet and rose to the top
I'm the cleanup man with the mop
50 shots disfigured his top, yes (disfigured)
I come from the city of God (God)
I walk around in the city like God (God)
Made it out and still come back
Somebody, please tell me, what are the odds?
On this mic I am a wizard, but this is not Oz
Cold but hot, I can turn the summer to fall
I'm sicker than y'all
Don't talk to me unless you talkin' 'bout paper
I'm buyin' some acres, no time for a neighbor
I'm from New Orleans, yes, I am a gator
I’ll do you a favor, and not do you a favor
'Cause if I do you a favor
And you don't come back with that paper
I'ma have to lay hands on you
Like I'm givin' you prayer
Eastside, we ain't playin' it fair
You ever heard of the tortoise and hare?
I'm switchin' the gear
Started off in the back, bitch
But now I'm winnin', it's clear
Nigga, I'm here
Gudda!

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
For real
(Blows smoke)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got my married hoes on single drugs
Got my fattest hoes gettin' finger fucked
And my trashiest hoes is clean as fuck
And my nastiest hoes is neat as fuck
Take your shoes off before you walk inside
Take your shoes off before you cross the line
I snoozed off on Father Time
Got my goons to go kidnap Daughter Time
Come to wet the party up, and whoever in it
Got one gun that shoot for seven minutes
I'm done shitting, niggas never spit it
I'm high class, niggas' elementary
Repetition, that's the definition
I'm a Hot Boy under air conditionin'
Shoot the gun with the left arm limpin'
George Jefferson in all seven minutes
Got a hot girl off television
With a very sticky unhairy kitty
In the right position, screamin' "You're consistent"
I sit there and listen like we talkin' business
I don't need her out here filmin' niggas
I'd really rather have her steal from niggas
I really travel like a pilgrim, nigga
Kush loud as Fred screamin' "Wilma!", nigga
I've been takin' time out to count the bands
Break a promise in the promised land
Going zagga zow off of zagga xans
From the middleman to the Macho Man
I've been talkin' shit up in Diddy house
Went to Disneyland, talked to Mickey Mouse
Then I figured out how to figure out
What I was figurin' out, you figure it out
Got a trigger man with an extra hand
My bitches sleep by my bitch's house
So every party is a slumber party
Sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you runnin' round, I'ma run it up
You dumb it down, I ain't dumb enough
I hit the courtroom and stunk it up
High comin' down, plug comin' up
You gon' hold me down, you gon' hold me up
You don't know me, but you know what's up
And the coke was cut with some extra coke
Showed her more than love, she just shoulder-shrugged
She don't know it's love, it's not important love
As long as we can keep extortin' the plug
Just let him bleed and ignore the blood
Just let him be and ignore the buzz
Pour it up, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but it still bust
Bust good as fuck, every bullet struck
Like a hundred holes, got a hole-in-one
Safe full as fuck, money full of dust
And I'm pulling up in that "What the fuck?"
That's a muscle car, got me lookin' buff
If you look enough, you a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids
Bugatti on Chevron
All-white like an Altoid
All these rings on, call me Bellboy
From the Teflon to the Kevlar
Don't mean shit when your head off
Make the top dog jump dead off
Then we keep his head for a memoir
I sped off with the head off
Goin' big Bruno on Mars
Sippin' Lone Star, turn a pornstar
To a known star with a phone call

[Bridge]
Hold up; murky, murky water, yeah
Purple, purple rivers, yeah
Floatin' purple ribbons, yeah
I'm cursed, but still religious, damn
I've been poppin' 10s, yeah
'Cause my bitch pop all the 20s, damn
Why you hatin' on the skinnys, damn
I met Satan, he was chillin', hold up

[Outro]
Murky, murky water
Purple, purple rivers
Floatin' purple ribbons
I'm cursed but still religious
Damn
Take your clothes off bitch
Call your road dog, bitch
I feel like O-Dog, bitch
Boyz 2 Menace

[Intro: HoodyBaby and Lil Wayne]
And when I bust I yell "Eureka", yeah
And when I bust I yell "Eureka", yeah
6 shit

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Dropped out of school, I fucked the teacher
Spent a mil' on misdemeanor
Miss my brodies, miss Aaliyah
Spendin' money like amnesia
Spent some money on sativa
Got that strip club diabetes
Make it rain cats and dogs
All night long, I need PETA
White girl, black diva
I'm in here fuckin' on a zebra
I beat it up like John Cena
Talkin' crazy, bilingual
Put some diamonds in my teefus
Got me lookin' like a genius
Leave you bloody like a fetus
Cut your tongue off, leave you speechless
Put some money on subpoenas
Could've gave that to Miss Cita
Nigga stunner, he a skeezer
From the heart and out the speakers
I was young, I heard the preacher
I grew up and met the reaper
That codeine my anesthesia
Tried to kick but this ain't FIFA
She snort one line, want a sequel
She snort two and want a threesome
She snort three lines, yell "Adidas"
When I bust I yell "Eureka"
When I bust I yell "Eureka"
When she bust she yell for Jesus
Drop her off at the cathedral
She come back with a bunch of singles
Phones are tapped, we switch the lingo
Hustle where the grass is greener
Clean the blood off the walls
Then break out the Stanley Steamer
It's a drought on cocaina
I know routes through Pasedena
I got two keys of that Bieber
Call 'em Justin and Justina
Sippin' on that Angelina
I'm low profile in a Bimmer
Where it's sour, could be sweeter
I got sugar, I got creamer
More extremer, more obscener
Doin' numbers, yellin' "Bingo"
Coca leaf so come and get some
White power from a negro
Spent some money on my legal
And that money was illegal
That's my bloody, that's my migo
Reppin' cinco like he Tito
I'm gettin' high under gazebo
With a bride and no tuxedo
I'm a bitch magnet, Magneto
Hit that pussy like the R.I.C.O
Young money with no wrinkles
Hot tubbin' with the chicas
Run around naked like they streakers
Run around this bitch like Ezekiel
Good Quality coke, that's GQ
Boy this base don't need no EQ
She snort one line, want a sequel
When I bust I yell "Eureka", hey

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Took her out the game, sent her to the bleachers
Kick her out in style, Balenciaga sneakers
Broke up with my bitch, I feel like shit, my dog
She kept talkin' fifty-fifty, had to split, my dog
She kept on fallin' in and out of love, I tripped her dog
Told me eat or get ate, so I sipped her dog
I'ma go platinum, she single
She blow up my phone, but the bitch got no ringer
Bought her a ring but I left with a finger
Stack up my cake and I bust down some zingers
Hello, ho, you gots to go, ho
I'm on the road, ho, high profile, movin' work on the low
Smokin' OG, girl you gotta go
Know you ain't on, girl you gotta know
Got that backward, girl, you kinda slow
The snakeskin I know you see on, this a no

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And when I bust I yell "Eureka", yeah
And when I bust I yell "Eureka", yeah
And when we fuck it's for no reason, yeah
Record that shit and watch the reruns, yeah
And when I bust I yell "Eureka", yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
That's some sick shit, yeah
That's some six shit

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Tunechi
Barbie
Young Money

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, I been smokin' gas, killin' bitches
Man, I feel just like a gang-star (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Cover up my face like a ninja
In this Alexander Wang scarf (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'ma drop a bag, they gon' pull up
And then they gon' let them things off (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I ain't switchin' up my hairstyle
But my niggas let it bang off

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Percocets and Addies, lookin' for a fuck I could give
All these hatin' bitches plottin', why they can't let me live?
Me and Weezy in LIV (Ayy, ayy)
When my album drop these bitches is gon' cry in the car
All your yes-men out here lyin', had you dyin' to spar
You was tryin' too hard (Mm)
I'm out here livin' though, I am out here livin' though
Me and Tunechi winnin' though
Slimes out here twinnin' though
I am on my pivot though, I am just so pivotal
Bands, I go get it though, Weezy on his pedestal
A lot of gang shit, a whole lot of gang shit
All these plaques is pilin' up, it's nowhere to hang shit
These bitches pussy though
Pushed them out my pussy though
Niggas want my cookie though
'Cause it taste like cookie dough
Smoke, I got a free pack; flow sick, get a Z-pak
Niggas don't mean my race when they say "She blacked"
I am the Queen (Facts), I'm everything she lacks
Bitch get on your kneecap, I don't mean C. Kaep'
I'll get you checked, pussy; I'll get you a free pap
You bitches don't ball out, you get your QB sacked
I'm OBJ, hoes; break records like ankles
I've been that bitch since ice cream with the sprinkles

[Segue: Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em carry on, they gon' miss me when I'm gone
I'm gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest In Peace to Honda

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Neo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah
Pop some X with my exotic dancer
She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Mazda
Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Switch her, put her in Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Uber
That's some sick shit

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah...  Sick shit
I been walkin' on this water, bone dry, hard times
R.I.P. baby, my phone died, but don't cry
Heaven's gates was closed, I went to Hell, there was a long line
Two hoes in the bed, it's hard to wake up on the wrong side

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Few bumps in the road, a little bump and grind I don't mind
Please know, for your fuckin' piggy bank you could get hog tied
Two Ninas on me, you fuck with me, them girls goin' wild
Guilty conscience pimpin', make my ho sit through the whole trial
I been walkin' on this fuckin' water for a long time
Molly water got me transformin' like I'm Voltron
Smokin' so much weed, I might just fuck around and hug a tree
A tree without a bird 'cause I deserve every fuckin' leaf

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
1, 2, 3; triple-OG
At the T-O-P smokin' P-O-T
From a D-O-G to the G-O-D
Got OCD and not your CD
Hit her with the D-O-P-E D
That's Dope Dick Tunechi, DDT
You could D-I-E for a F-E-E
I'll D-I-E for my S-E-T
I told my son that "Whatever the sun touch is yours, little nigga"
I told my daughter, "Don't give up your love to a poor little nigga"
I told my bitch if she cheat then she making a poor decision
I told that bitch if she leave then she leavin' the solar system
But hoes don't listen
But I'm on the road to riches, and she can't ignore the engine
I bought myself a medallion that cost an Azure, my nigga
I don't know, guess I was bored, my nigga
Tell foreign hoes "I'm El Señor", my nigga
To the Moon like Warren, nigga
He ain't the plug unless he foreign, nigga
It ain't a car unless it's foreign, nigga
And a R plus another R, my nigga
But I used to want a Ford Explorer, nigga
Had to move the trap house to Florida, nigga
Had to move The Carter by the water, nigga
But I'm still too scared to get in the water, nigga
'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is holes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga
But I’m watching Oprah, nigga
In my white house layin' on my sofa, keepin' it soulful, nigga
I'm a young mogul, nigga
I'm a young Hova, nigga
My office is oval, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I step out that bitch like, "What's happenin'?"
Me and that little bitch I was nappin' in
Time to run with no rubber, I'm gamblin'
Just call me the rapper, I'm Chancin' it
Got a sassy bitch, told her "I'm daddy, bitch"
Do it look like I'm playin'? Kaepernick
Niggas don't know a star from an asterisk
This that new coffin, new casket shit
My killers killin' on purpose by accident
And you passed that shit like a laxative
Ain't where or why you trap, it's who you trappin' with
For me it's about who I travel with
Never about the bitch that I be snappin' on
It's the one that the picture just snapped me with
That's 'cause I'm the shit, and all of my shit be maggot less
E

[Verse 4: Baby E]
Yeah, uh-huh, said, yeah
This that Baby E and Wayne shit
We just landed in a spaceship
So now ain't nobody safe, bitch
It's Dedication number 6, bitch
Got a hundred in the safe, bitch
I been fuckin' on a gay bitch
Fuck your set and what you claim, bitch
It's Young Mula to the grave, bitch
I'm still finessin', and I'm still progressin'
This is tick, tick-tick, I'ma blow up any second, yeah
We the bestest, ain't no fuckin' question
It's six, six-six, 'til it's Dedication 7
Fully loaded, money is the motive
All my bros is Gs, take a guess at what the code is
Pour a four in, fuck it pour some more in
Rest In Peace Lil Peep, we already miss you homie

[Outro: Baby E]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said "I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Intro: DJ Drama]
I realize you niggas is like the objects in the rearview mirror—
You really appear much closer than you are
Got a long way to go, young boy

[Verse 1: Euro + DJ Drama]
Uh
Uh
Check
(Catch up, niggas!)
Let 'em all in, bet 'em all in
Put me in the jungle, I get us all minks
Don't play with my wave
Know what? Let 'em all sink
I don't need therapy, I got so big
Even when they talk crazy I still don't shrink
I'ma black out, Michael Blackson's skin tone
Homie gotta sit for a while back home
Hotline bling if you get his phone
Gotta own up or you get disowned
Eyes dried up, I don't really cry much
And the gold chain match everything I touch
Whip gotta match every bitch I fuck, foreign
Y'all niggas talkin' 'bout what? Borin'
Bane from it, I came from it
I'm raised by it, I'm stained from it
Shot for the stars from the darkness
I aim from it, now change comin'
Who'd have thought a nigga shake somethin'?
All these records, I'ma break somethin'
Playin' my shit around the graveyard
Y'all fuck around and wake somethin'
Mean mug like I hate somethin'
Hit the stu' and I ate somethin'
Great rapper or a great hustler—
Promise you I die a great somethin'

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
And I am beginnin' and endin'
A nigga run in kickin' and flippin'
A nigga worth spendin'
A nigga with the semi admittin'
Glock is definitive on 'em, iron Emmys
Got an eye on 'em
Still on these niggas more than any one of you
We knuck if we buck, if you my brother we up
If not, I don't give a motherly fuck
Only in us we trust, you fuss we hush
They rush we bust, adjust, and dust and flushed 'em
If you don't know what my salary is
You 'bout to know what a fatality is
What the reality is
If I don't know what my calories is
Then nine times out of ten
You won't never know where your cavity is
Hit a forty, know it had to be his
A dude foul with a smile
They would never know how mad that he is
They don't ever know what pattern he is
He gotta be from Earth 2, or somewhere from out on Saturn he is
Now I'm goin' where no gravity is, some other galaxy shit
But we'd rather talk about the MAC and the bricks
We takin' on all names, it ain't no more games
I'm a stand up nigga, Cory Kaepernick bitch
I don't know what to call you
Niggas claimin' they loyal to the soil
But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
To court with the all you
You cannot avoid it when I'm gonna destroy you
Work from the ceiling to make sure that I fall you
I'm dedicated to this rhyme shit
S double, the militia gang, they don't ever try them bitch
I got a nine and click, a high been brick
A bottom bitch, I buy them thick
Drivin' stick, life's a bitch, and I give dick
I ride the five, my partner crip
Shout out the East, we parkin' shit
I just revive, I don't remix
I don't remind, until C5 we got D6, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
The best things in life are free, not cheap, free C5
Message, no reply
Rest In Peace, no peace sign
I keep an eye on these guys
My third eye give her sweet eyes
The bird eye's view keep spy
But I can get your wings deep fried
Try, try again, keep tryin'
All the traffic hours, you a taxi driver, we some maximizers
Ever heard of San Francisco 49'ers, we some masterminders
Made it to the top just to get sniped from the floor at the very bottom
Ain't that a bitch, man tell me about it
But I ain't trippin', unless the trip is private
I sip in silence
I tried to make it beautiful, and this shit came out perfect
Let the guns speak for they self, I ain't never been a loud person
Walkin' 'round the house in the turban
These niggas washed up with no detergent
Take your heart and I am not a surgeon
Pullin' triggers like shower curtains
Ain't got no soul because my baby sucked it out of me
Me and my whoas in Las Vegas playing the thot machines
Stick to my goals, expectations like a soccer team
Waiting to exhale only to let out some steam
Girl let's make a movie, what's a movie without a shower scene?
Treat my semi like an Emmy, need some nominees
Taught me how to count before they taught me how to read
I knew all my OG's before my ABC's

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Damn
That's some sick shit

Gangsta—
Gangsta—
Gangsta Grizzils

[Verse]
Well, tonight I found my price to the spender
And she cried about our life to the listener
And she asked me for advice, so I pimped her
Turn that chicken head to a chicken tender
In a Wraith, in a Wraith, out of state license plates
I got yay an AK and a temper
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Don't know how I'm drivin' straight
I sipped a lake of that grape, thirst quencher, oh
Girl, fuck with him and get your money
You fuck with me, you missin' money, then you miss your molly
I get the money, spend the money, then I miss the money
But it come right back, right back, right back
That's that Frisbee money
That's Santa climbin' down the chimney, money with the duffy
It come back, run around the gang, yeah that's some dizzy money
The Humpty Dumpty, she get on that dick, she's very comfy
I put a Rolie on her wrist, she used to wear a scrunchy
Party times, Tunechi wise
Wifey's size, truly lies
Booty, thighs, bougie pride
Gucci slides, moody, tired
Woozy, high, movie night
Jacuzzi time, ooo-ee, ahh
Dinner, prime; sushi, wine
And for dessert I have the cutie-pie
Lied about the price to the spender
And I lied about my height on Tinder
And if I hit it one time I won't remember
But can't forget it if she bring another member
Double date, double date
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Bitch, I'm eatin' full plate like November
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
In a different mind state
Let her sniff some snowflakes and call her Winter (yah)
Fuck with him and get the money
Then come fuck with me and split the money
I'll fuck her when she with her buddy
She guzzle dick and kiss her buddy
She said I love you when he send some money
I said I love you give your pimp some money
And she don't ask how much she just come dump it
And I don't ask how high I just start jumpin'
You ain't know I kiss below the button, what
Girl close your eyes and let me show you somethin', what
And if you ride me like the road is bumpin', what
I leave my key in and the motor runnin', what
Oh my god I hope they kissin' cousins
If they not it's gon' be consequences, repercussions
Woah, I just count a hundred thousand hundreds
And I told my babe ride the wave, Cowabunga
Lied about her night to her nigga
Her vagina 'bout to cry me a river
If she ask me for advice and I igged her
But she know it wasn't me, it was the sizzurp
Gotta wait, gotta wait
'Til I wake, 'til I wake
I wake up and tell bae how much I missed her
She looks straight in my face then start pointin' to the space
Where she want it on her face, she's particular

[Outro]
Y-O-U-N-G with money, yeah
We Y-O-U-N-G with money
Y-O-U-N-G with money
Y-O-U-N-G with money
Ayo, Stunna nigga need his money

[Intro: Gudda Gudda]
Gudda!
D6
Yeah

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I'mma cash out on the AP, new freezer
The coupe sit nice on some new feet, new sneakers
I took your bitch out to Pappadeaux's
She tried to order a sloppy joe
I told her give me some sloppy toppy
Then let her know she a sloppy ho
Tune pick me up in this brand new Bugatti
Two million cash, this is not a Ferrari
260 the dash, I smoke anybody
150K cash, it fit in my pocket
This is that D6, shout out to Drizzy in the 6
Mafia like it's the Three 6
Choppers make niggas do B-flips
Put the heat to your moon like an eclipse
Burn niggas like a freak bitch
Flip and turn you like a key switch
'Cause you bit the hand that I feed with
Yeah, only time will tell, nigga
I sat back and tried to tell niggas
If you try to test me, watch you fail, nigga
D-triple-6, I'm raisin' hell, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Death wish, death wish, death wish
I come to fulfill your death wish
First I must refill my beverage
That's promethazine, sold separate
That's from Texas, she's from who knows
I got new doors I ain't step in
I got new hoes I ain't hit yet
I ain't hit yet? Time is precious
I got pre-rolls I ain't lit yet
I got pre-thoughts I ain't think yet
I got money I ain't see yet
And they wan' know why I ain't blink yet
I got big bags in my book bag
Make me walk around like Hunchback
Diamonds so bright on my one hand
Gave all five fingers a sun-tan
Haters upset, that's a fun fact
I got pussy in my lunch bag
I got soap and I got towels
Bullet showers lead to bloodbaths
I got hoodies that say 'Young Money'
I got bitches that steal them from me
They go home and then they send pictures
To my phone with nothing under it
What am I to do? I'm lovin' it
I run a bad-ass bitches company
That's my company, my bitches humble me
I saw your bitches, that was comedy
I got the romedy, oops I meant remedy
I got the chemistry, and the amenities
Up in my bedroom, holding assembly
They leave feelin' good; physically, mentally
Meditate, meditate; think about yesterday
Fuck what that nigga say, think about yesterday
I can't do everyday, I could do very late
Just hit me up and now go check my resume
Get out that Chevrolet, jump in this better Wraith
I know you see the doors open like Heaven Gates
She think I'm Heaven sent, and I would not forgive every sin
But I forget everything
Thanks to the medicine, thanks to the purple stuff
I'm finna pour it up, I'm finna stir it up
If I had a heart it'd be a purple one
Pockets too fat, I'm pulling my girdle up
Shots of Bumbu, I'm finna serve 'em up
I got them comfy and kind and courteous
I put the old bodies in the new freezer
Brrrr, I never heard of her, six shit

[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mmm-mh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I been smokin' on the gas, hocus pocus on the gas
I been snorklin' in the cash, going Krogers with the bags
I done went blonde, goin' Hulk Hogan on they ass
Tell my shooters "Count me out", and I end up doin' the math
I been fuckin' in the shower so my dreads soaked
I been fuckin' on the counter 'cause my bed's soaked
You know my lean nice and cold, like some dead folks
You know my eyes nice and low, like I make egg rolls, oh
I got them pills, we call 'em illies
I got the wet, I'm water whippin'
I rob his ass like Robin Givens
I get them Ms a mile a minute
Don't pay your bill, I'm power trippin'
BET, that's how I'm livin'
I got three hoes followin' me
Ho, ho, ho; I'm down the chimney
Hello, I make her throw away her pussy toys, yeah
Ain't got a job, I make her look employed, yeah
She do the money count in just her drawers, yeah
I make her count out loud, I listen hard
I been fuckin' models, they been walkin' 'round in towels
They been snortin' powder, I been in here takin' downers
They been countin' for hours, getting kisses by the thousands
Money and the power, they be in here watchin' Power
All my shooters accurate, codeine like a daiquiri
Run up, run up in your factory, mask is on like Michael Jackson
Brrrt! Pull up like a taxi, stereo on maxi
Nigga, bury your own casket
Nigga, say hello to Rabbit
My lil homies bang, my lil homies, they deranged
They don't want the fame, kill your ass then fly to Spain
Ding-ding, coke and ice cream, that shit got a nice ring
Put my face up in the pussy, I'm just sight-seeing
Yeah, starin' at the world through an automatic
Sweet mother of pearl, sweet Jesus of Nazareth
Quickly, quickly, quickly, gettin' slow, baby
I could turn your baby to a poor baby, sure baby
Look, I cannot sit down without gettin' down
What's new in town? Let's do it now
A couple marbles ain't been found
A couple screws been screwed around
My father ain't been 'round, my heart ain't missed a pound
The system of a down, and it's been up and down
A psycho, all I'm missin' is the gown
Sippin' up, I piss enough to drown, twistin' up a pound
High as fuck, a Bentley truck on clouds, y'all so underground
I break a whole bunch of fuckin' vows
Come to hunt you down
All up in your section
Use protection when you fuck around
Possession of deception, imperfection, no affection
No correct your transgression, turn depression to aggression
Got an obsession for expression
With no pressure, no discretion, and the F is for the
"Flesh of all the fleshless ones, I left 'em, F 'em."

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
Your bitch open so we run in it, any club, got my gun in it
I ain't even got to touch you dudes, I'll get you killed young nigga
Eat, sleep, talk shit, rap, brand new AK, all black
Tunechi gave me this gift wrapped
Your bars sweet, candy, Kit-Kat
Hope you pussy niggas get mad
Keep the voodoo on me, witchcraft
Off-White, Gucci, mix match
All my diamonds drip, shit splash
Black BMW, your bitch gave me top at the W
She told me Dollaz I'm over you
These bitches way too emotional, uh
So much perkys, I'm barely sober
Diamond choker, crazy, bipolar
Keep my niggas with me, I tote 'em
Never be committed, I told her
Enough with you niggas, I do not fuck with you niggas
I know I'm stuck with you niggas
Grew up with you niggas
We all was swipin' cards, scammin' it up with you niggas
Miami ballin', it's a hobby, call a nigga Joe Robbie
Haitian food or hibachi, ATV's, walkie-talkies
Chris Paul, we load the rocket
Eight ball, corner pocket
Ah man, nigga stop it, you know it's Dollaz
When it comes to rap, no problems
Haha, hold up, talk to 'em
I'm the hottest out in my city, Bad Boy too, ask Diddy
Hundred foot yacht, jet skiin', bitches kissin' bitches, lesbian
Niggas talkin' beef, let's see 'em
Y'all don't want beef, y'all vegan
If so, come, no semen
(Yeah, you get it?)
Future put me on, he from Atlanta
Niggas in my city crabs in a barrel
Made it out without y'all help
I can say I did it myself
Tunechi told me leave this beat blessed
I killed this shit, no stress
First 48, this stretch
Someone tell me what's next?

[Intro: Lil Wayne (DJ Drama)]
Yeah, I really don't wear shades when I do my verses

[Verse 1]
Roses are red, our eyes are too, yeah

None of this shit she heard before
My lies all new, true
I cross my heart, I won't cross you, damn
Ride me so good I need horse shoes, ohh
Eat that shit out like some soul food, yeah
Cut the shit down, you'll hear old Tune, brrp
She come to my house and I got drugs layin' 'round
So easy to pick up, and they so hard to put down
Gift and a curse
And she don't mind fuckin' with girls
As long as Tiffany's first
Hello, fuck it

[Hook]
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little brazy, but she still wavy (Suwu)
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little faded, but she still savin' (Fuck you)

[Verse 2]
Roses are red, our eyeballs too
We go from the sofa, to floor, to the bed, these nice walls too
Roses are red, our skin tone too, yeah
Let's go off to space, the way stars do, (Pewm)
We gone, it's all in our heads, and our hearts too, (Vroom)
I'm gone, she waitin' in bed for that part two, (Skrt)
I'm back, and we argue all mornin', fuck all noon, (Err-Ehh)
That's what the bed and the walls do
Hel-Hello? She come to my house and I got guns layin' 'round
But, she treat each one of them like it's her own child
Gift and the curse
And she don't mind fuckin' with girls as long as Tiffany's first
Hello, fuck it (Suwu)
Roses are red and my stones too
The roses are dead and my phone too
Damn, I'm changin' her life, her ringtone too
Cut that shit down, you'll hear old Tune

[Hook]
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She-she get a little brazy, but your bitch basic
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She said, "Fuck that nigga, Baby, I'm your real baby."
(Fuck it)
That's my little baby, that's my little baby
She get a little faded, but she steal safely

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
That's my dawg for sure

To get all my dawgs back, I'd give up all you hoes
To get all my dawgs back, I'd give up all you hoes

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
HoodyBaby really, really rich
HoodyBaby pull up with the clique (hello)
Hoody crippin' rollin' with the six
Now I'm in a 'Rari bumpin' Nip
Black and yellow bitches on my stick
Black and yellow, treat me like I'm Wiz
Hustle in Atlanta like I'm TIP
(Brrrrr, hello?)
College bitch, tweakin' for my dick
Hit her college park like I'm Tit
I want turkey pasta with the shrimp
That ain't have shit to do with this
30 bitches tellin' me I'm the shit
Juice man, screamin' 32
Juice man, screamin' 32
O.J. know my number's 36
Diamonds crip walkin' on my chest
Sent a package right to Bouldercrest
I heard your boy sippin Quali, y'all some qualiticians
Yeah we politic, but fuck a politician
You be smokin' Bobby Brown, new edition

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Run off with your bitch, she change her number
Run into another bitch and fumble
Money talkin' more than Bryant Gumbel
Too much shit on my mind, I need a plumber
Made love to a whore and changed my number
Pull up on a boat like I'm Columbus
Tongue all in her throat, all in her tunnel
Pussy monster, I'ma need a muzzle
Wake up Sunday night and go to LIV
A bitch back at the crib tryna live
A pool in the back, I let her swim
I give her phone back and let her film
Free will like the goodwill
She real thick, waist real lil
Weed real bright, it look teal
Coke real white, it look clear
0 to 100 to a mill
From nothin' to somethin' to a big deal
Got to keep it trill in the field
I ain't Cash Money no more
And I put some carats on my bitch's wrist
Put some carats on my bitch's fist
Put some carats in my bitch's ears
I came fast money, let's go
And my heart goes out to Vegas, keep it real
I just met some strippers on the strip
Flew 'em to Miami, take a trip
Flew 'em back to Vegas with some gifts
That's just how it is, is, is
Ain't trickin' if you got it, nigga rich
I feel like satan, nigga lit
Dedication 6-6-6
G-Wagon on six wheels
They in they feelin's, fuck how niggas feel
Coke in the car, I'm in a snowmobile
I'm sippin' that Evander Holyseal
This is that codeine overkill
My mud colder than Soldier Field
In love, but all these hoes is weird
These hair triggers, I might grow a beard
Brazy, yeah, but you know the drill
I'm way up there, you right over here
Have you ever seen the light hit my grill?
I stand there and smile in the mirror
Snap my fingers, dollars appear
Out of nowhere and I don't do L's
And I married the mob when I was like twelve
Turned out well, like Tom and Giselle
Ain't readin' texts 'cause I'm readin' checks
I don't text 'cause that is finger sex
Then I'm turnin' off my ringer next
Airplane mode, no I'ma need a jet
I'm dope, babe, I need a needle set
Chains rock it, can't see the neck
Pockets crowded like the Beatles set
I drop it off and gave Ms. Cita that
Whip milky, I'ma sip filthy
I sip this shit just like it's healthy
Who spilt it, wait my bitch guilty?
Uber, Uber; she'll be missed dearly
Sincerely, yeah it's yours truly
Call me Tune, the hoes call me Tunechi
Rockin' Louis while the pot brewin'
With a Chinese bitch that look like thot suey
Told the straight hoes I'm taken
Told the gay hoes I'm vacant
Took some diamonds out her old bracelet
Put 'em on the quotes in my statements
I'm a born slanger, a born slanger
One more time, I'm a born slanger
Draco like a volcano
You can fuck around and get your star spangled
Barbaric, yeah your bitch starin'
I look very good, good very
It ain't all about the werewolf
It's all about what the wolf wearin'
You a popped cherry, yeah a Cherry Bomb
We everywhere like the Marriott
Shots sprayed like Malaria
Hit your head like a Triceratops
For my dawg, I'll kill you and your ho
Yeah, me and my dawg, we put another on the road
Hold up my female dawg, she 'bout to put on a show
But to get my dawg back, I'd give up all of these hoes

[Intro]
Dedication 6
See, normally this where I'd say
"And like that, we gone"
Ahh, ah, this that 6 shit
Ah, Dedication 6
But really, we just halfway
Dedication 6, ah, ahh
This that 6 shit, ah, Dedication 6
This just part one!
Yah, yah-ahh (Gangsta Griz-ills!)

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'd die to be
The bitch that'll die for me
Strap doves to her body and fly to me
But you get too high to me (Y'all ready?)

[Hook 1]
And you don't even believe in Yeezus
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never swallowed semen
I don't even believe her speeches
You can't even keep a secret
Why you wear Victoria Secret
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' you with both my fingers

[Verse]
Baby I'm out your league, bitch
You know there's no more me's, bitch
You need to show more cleavage
V-neck polo tees, bitch
You need to patch your weave, bitch
You need to pack your things, bitch
You on some "I had a dream" shit
It's back to reality, bitch
She don't even roll the weed
All she do is roll her eyes
All she know is social media
We don't even socialize
I feel like North Korea
Even though we oceanside
All I say is "Mama-mia"
She don't even know her moms
All she say is "This your pussy"
She say that to most of the guys
She don't even know it's dry
I can't even open fire
She don't even close her eyes
She don't even close the blinds
She spit all over the D
I'm sticky like porcupines
She don't even compromise
I still make her cum three times
I still make her snort some lines
And make her look so surprised
I still her make her recognize
Make her exercise to a sexier size
Then I tell her how to tell better lies
Now her extra guys think she never lie
We got a better bond, we have a better time
She got a wetter pond
I cum ahead of time, and a second time
And in record time
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I make a second line
I'm a Megatron
I got her legs up like the Omega sign
And I know she rolling 'cause I checked her tires
Then I checked her eyes, she a little rough around the edges, fine
Like Checkers fries
And the X was mine
She requested five
So I gave her two and told her stretch the high
We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh
Then she woke up high, like "Oh my God" and tried to rectify
But if you naked, why?
If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot
I'ma wake the block, I'ma break the lock
Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out
I'ma shake my head when you turn around
Cops shake they head when they see your house
We shot it up, but look like we burned it down
Hor-Horror scene, bitch
Everyday Halloween, bitch
Kidnap, hide and seek, bitch
I'm a legend like Socrates, bitch
I aim at your collard green, bitch
Bada-boom, bada-bing, bitch
I'm looking for a solid, clean bitch
I tell her "Look, honestly, bitch"

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'll die to be
The bitch that'd die for me
Stickin' to a nigga like Siamese
And you just on the side of me

[Hook 2]
And you don't even like Adidas
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never had a threesome
I dont' even believe her speeches
She don't even believe in freedom
But all she giving me is freebies
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' her with both my fingers

[Outro]
6 shit
To be continued
D6!

[Verse 1]
She wakes up early in the morning just to do her hair y'all
Cause it's a new her
She just wanna live her life tryin' to find her freedom
Been looking for freedom
She may not see the light but she wants it, she wants it
As she stares herself in the mirror

[Chorus]
(She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
Do what she's supposed to do - she's rollin')
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da

[Verse 2]
She from the block and she's rollin'
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'
They try hard not to care about her new life
They got their own mess
But none of this is for you cause this is her life
Don't need you to apologize
She found a brand new me as she stares herself in the mirror

[Chorus]
(She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
Do what she's supposed to do - she's rollin')
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da

[Bridge]
She from the block and she's rollin'
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'
In my sleep I see her beggin', reaching from me
It took a long road to get here
It took a brave girl, brave girl for trying
She's just like you and me 'cause she wants it, she wants it
As she stares herself in the mirror

[Chorus]
(She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
Do what she's supposed to do
She do what she's supposed to do
She's a brand new me, she's a brand new you
She's a brand new me - she's rollin')
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
Brand new me, brand new you
Something new overdue
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da
La da dee, la dee da

[Outro]
She from the block and she's rollin'
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'
She's rollin'
She's rollin'
She's brand new and she's rollin'
She's rollin'
She's brand new and she's rollin'
She's brand new and she's rollin'
She from the block and she's rollin
She got her own and she's rollin'
She's all alone and she's rollin'
She's a brand new girl and she's rollin'
She's rollin'

[Verse 1]
You say you want me, I don't ignore you
You said it first, but I meant it more girl
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You got potential, I can't explain it
You're so persuasive, I made some changes
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I don't know if we'll find a better time
Where were you this whole time?
Come and see me now, not another time
You should come see me on the regular
I don't know if we'll find a better time

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleepin' with a pistol in my bed
I'd rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Don't let me down, come here right now (Yeah)
Don't let me down, come here right now

[Verse 2]
Grow up and face it, don't keep me waiting
You love me how you love me, then just say it
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girl, what's the hold-up? Come take me over
You came the closest, we should be closer
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleepin' with a pistol in my bed
I'd rather have you here instead, I gotta get outta my own head
Don't let me down, come here right now (Yeah)
Don't let me down, come here right now

Times are getting' hard boys
Money's getting' scarce
If times don't get no better boys
Gonna leave this place

Take my true love by the hand
Lead her from the town
Say goodbye to everyone
Goodbye to everyone

Take my bible from the bed
Shotgun from the wall
Take old Sal and hitch her up
The wagon for to haul

Pile the chairs and beds on high
Let nothing touch the ground
Sal can pull and we can push
We're bound to leave this town

Made a crop a year ago
It withered to the ground
Tried to get some credit
But the man he turned me down
Goin' to California
Where everything is green
Gonna have the best old farm
That you have ever seen
Go away from my window
Go away from my door
Go away way from my bedside
And bother me no more
And bother me no more

I'll give you back your presents
You give me back my ring
And I won't forget my own true love
As long as song birds sing
As long as song birds sing

I'll tell all of my brothers
I'll tell my shipmates too
The reason that my heart is broke
Is all because of you
Is all because of you
Tony shot his Delia
'T was on a Saturday night
The fist time he shot her
She bowed her head and died

Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone
Delia's gone, Delia's gone
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone

Called for the doctor
The doctor came too late
Called for the Minister
Take Delia to her fate

Well they took my Delia
Dressed her all in brown
Took her to the graveyard
And then they laid her down

Delia oh Delia
Where you been so long
Everybody's talking about
My Delia's dead and gone
Walking on the green grass
Walking side by side
Walking with a pretty girl
Who's gonna be my bride

Shopping by the millpond
Long enough to kiss
And to pick a golden bell
For my lovely miss

Listening to the lark of the morning
Flying over head
Gazing on the church in the valley
Where we'll soon be wed

As we go walking on the green grass
Nature's plan is clear
Like the grass our love will grow
Fresh and new each year

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Welcome to the Panty Circus
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Ladies and gentlemen, Lady Gaga (Gaga)

[Verse 1]
Who's that girl?
Running 'round with no clothes on
Heels in the ground
Almost famous on the scene
She looks like a celebrity
Who's that girl?
She's so shiny
Ain't no way her waist that tiny
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I lost my clothes but everybody knows
We get naughty at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous
Let's get naughty at the panty party

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
What are you doing over there?
We're gonna play in underwear
Spanky pants, curious
Bubble wrapper, furious
Who's that girl?
She's so pretty
Bet you she's from New York City
Sequins in her hair
Homegirl doesn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby shake your fanny, fanny
Let me see them pretty panties

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I lost my clothes but everybody knows
We get naughty at the panty party
It's time to get undressed and make it glamorous

[Intro]
What do you say we get outta here kid?

[Verse 1]
One lost lady and the radio creep
Got your hands in my pockets while you spinnin' the beat
The vinyl spins fast while we trippin' on that
She said ''we can't stand still"
One trick bunny and a haunting man
Got lost in the woods with a gun in the hand
She said ''hey love child, take me back''
I said ''we can't stand still"

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual (sexual)

[Verse 2]
Heard a story 'bout the medicine man
Drove straight to the coast in his minivan
He learned the ways of the local dudes
He said ''I can't stand still"
Missy Brown went to pristine high
Met the medicine man for a token around
She said ''It's been so long since we got down''
He said ''I can't stand still''

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names
Feel so retrosexual

[Bridge]
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
The girls go round and round
The boys go round and round
If the world goes round and round
We all go round and round
What do you saw? Get outta here kid!

[Chorus]
Shake your head cause she wants you
Close your eyes and see through

When twilight rivals the closing day
My thoughts go wandering far away
When I gaze at the skies above
My thoughts return to the one I love

So take me, take me, 'cause I'm feeling lonely
Take me back to Lucy's door
But don't let her mother know

Her mother tell her get steady man
A man of letters from wealthy clan
And when I call at Lucy's door
Her mother tell me "Don't come no more"

So take me, take me, 'cause I'm feeling lonely
Take me back to Lucy's door
But don't let her mother know

But I love the sea and I love the sweat
It's an honest wage an' I have respect
For how much more can there be in life
Than happy children and loving wife
So take me, take me, 'cause I'm feeling lonely
Take me back to Lucy's door
But don't let her mother know

Judy's mama sent her to market
Ev'ry body bawl out Judy drownded
Told her not to linger so she won't forget
Ev'ry body bawl out Judy drownded

Judy drownded, Judy drownded
Wa'yo Judy drownded
Judy drownded, Judy drownded
Wa'yo Judy drownded

When she look around, the stream had caught her
Ev'ry body bawl out Judy drownded

Judy drownded, Judy drownded
Wa'yo Judy drownded

This is my island in the sun
Where my people have toiled since time begun
I may sail on many a sea
Her shores will always be home to me

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

When morning breaks the heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

I see woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the water side
Casting nets at the surging tide
Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

I hope the day will never come
When I can't awake to the sound of drum
Never let me miss carnival
With calypso songs philosophical

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

Sad the time, I'll ever miss
The gay colored skirts as they turn and twist
Let me always hear soft guitars
And a maiden's voice 'neath a thousand stars

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand
The sweetest wine in the world
Is the fruit on the vine
The sweetest love and our truth
Is the love of your youth

At fifteen I saw her and thought her
So beautiful I kissed her from a distance
For my young love was locked inside

The sweetest wine in the world
Is the fruit on the vine
The sweetest love neath the skies
Is the love she denies

At sixteen I met her and Yet her
Sweet loving lips were eager for another
And my young love was cast aside

The sweetest wine in the world
Is the fruit on the vine
The sweetest love I had learned
Is the love that's returned
At eighteen I mood her
Afraid love would once again you loot her
I pursued her and I made her my darling bride

Shes mine now forever and ever
Ill sip the wine of fifteen, sixteen, eighteen
For the fruit on the vine is mine
Some say that love's a gentle thing
But it's only brought me pain
'Cause the only one I ever did love
Has gone with the midnight train

I never will marry, never take me a wife

I expect to live single all the rest of my life
The train pulled out, the whistle blew
With a low and a lonesome mourn
She's gone, she's gone like the midnight dew
And left me here alone

I never will marry, never take me a wife

I expect to live single all the rest of my life
There's many a change in the winter wind
And a change in the clouds design
There's many a change in a young girls heart
But never a change in mine
I never will marry, never take me a wife
I expect to live single all the rest of my life
I'm goin' away for to stay a little while
But I'm comin' back if I go ten thousand miles
Oh who will tie your shoes

And who will glove your hand
And who will kiss your ruby lips when I am gone
Look away, look away, over yondro

The morning sun will return your glowing smile
For I'm comin' back if I go ten thousand miles
Then I will tie your shoes
And I will glove your hand
And I will kiss your ruby lips when I return
Look away, look away, over yondro
Time for sleep, time to go to bed
The sun is lying down upon a deep cloud of red
Shut your drowsy eyes and count the sheep, sleepy head
One star is shyly peeping, goodnight it's time for sleeping

Sleep my little one
Dream your dreams in my arms safely curled
Dream of joy and of laughter and fun
Small one it's such a big world

May your heart never ache
Big world don't make his heart break
Sleep little one and dream

[Verse 1]
You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses

[Pre-Chorus]
Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

[Verse 2]
Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wonderin' if you're givin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

[Bridge]
You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer

[Outro]
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
You don't have to answer

I love thee, more than the meadow where the grass is so still
More than the mulberries on the hill
More than the buds on the mayapple tree, I love thee

[Bridge]
Arms have I, strong as the oak, for this occasion
Lips have I, to kiss thee sweet, in friendly persuasion

[Outro]
Thee is mine, though I don't know many words of praise
Thee pleasures me in a hundred ways
I have on my bonnet, my cape, and my gloves
And I'll go with thee, for thee I love

[Intro: Post Malone]
Ayy, ayyy
Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh shit, hey (Pizzle)
I just did like twenty shots and now I'm standin' on top of a cop car (Hey, hey, ayy)
She been givin' me head for twenty minutes, man, this bitch gotta have lockjaw (Yeah, yeah, hey, ayy, woo, woo)
Ain't no retirin', bitch I'm firin' out the car, let the Glock off (Hey, hoo)
And it's a job, take the car to the karate shop and chop that bitch like water (Hey, ayy, hey, ayy)
Man, my shit been going back-to-back, grrra-ta-ta-ta, just like a choppa (Ayy, oh, hey, ayy)
Police pull up behind me, ain't no time to go and hide it, throw the rock far (Yeah, hey, yeah)
Valuable (Yeah, oh, oh, oh yeah), for twenty minutes, oh man, my shit is 'bout as swole as a gold bond (Hey, oh, hey, hey, ayy)
I got plenty more, prolly fifty more, but this is what we did so far-ar-ar

[Chorus: Post Malone, T-Pain & Joey Bada$$]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
(Ah-ahah-ahah)
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy, woo!)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta, yeah, hey)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi

When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (Yeah, ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
This that Amethyst Rockstar-life, might not make it
Drop gems 'til I shine bright, just be patient
Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, "Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix"
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi
T-Pain, Post Malone, Joey Bad, this is godly
Huh, hahaha

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Chorus]
I know you dig 'cause I dig, oh no
I don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh no
Don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh ho
You play with me, then I'm sprayin', yo, ya
You play with me, I'm gon' spray it, oh ho
I don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh no
Don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh ho
You play with me, an' I'm sprayin'
I pull up with dirty sticks an' I'ma spray it

[Verse 1]
She was so fine (she was so fine)
So I let her push the foreign ride an' sit in it (skrrt)
I'm starin' at the toilet like I wan' go shit on niggas (what?)
I'd rather kill a nigga (oh boy) before I squeal on niggas (on God)
(Know I'm sayin', man? Real dripset shit, man, give it to 'em, ya dig?)
Copped her a coupe and now she say I'm the best
I taught her, she ain't gon' tell, you can put her to the test
I flood with her Chanel whenever she get upset (what?)
I bought a gold rope and I flex it on the v-neck
Beat her like Funkmaster Flex
Lock on that knit like a bitch
That pussy pink like a pig
R.I.P. to OG double D, bitch I dig
Drink on that lean until it's 

[?]
I'ma leak that sauce and fill the world with slimes
Filled it with slimes and then we slimed up the streets
That pussy nigga tellin' looks so sloppy to me
Oh no

[Chorus]
I don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh no
Don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh ho
You play with me, then I'm sprayin', yo, ya
You play with me, I'm gon' spray it, oh ho
I don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh no
Don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh ho
You play with me, an' I'm sprayin'
I pull up with dirty sticks an' I'ma spray it

[Verse 2]
If you a G, say "fuck tha police" (fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
Pop, lock, and drop it on my gold teeth
I'ma run inside that pussy, dropped my codeine
Get it, drunk it, hit it, hit it, like Ginobili
(Like I said the first time, man, real dripset shit, y'know what I mean? Pay attention. I ain't through. Get it)
Pussy nigga starin' with his snail face
Twenty-fives, thirty-eights, fuck a shell-case (brrr)
Old hunnids, small head on a big plate (what?)
Eatin' good, vegetarian niggas actin' crazy
All these foreign cars, nigga, know we racin' (skrrt)
Got lots of foreign broads that I never chase
I swear it's five stars every time I eat
I swear it's five broads stuffin' in my face
You can have it, whoa, whoa, you can have it
These niggas sad and, we just livin' lavish
I went in the rabbit myself and picked out some carats
She know we not average and all of my niggas happy
Oh no

[Chorus]
I don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh no
Don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh ho
You play with me, then I'm sprayin', yo, ya
You play with me, I'm gon' spray it, oh ho
I don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh no
Don't give no fuck what you sayin', oh ho
You play with me, an' I'm sprayin'
I pull up with dirty sticks an' I'ma spray it

[Verse 1]
Summer was lush
The winter is bony and rough here
Put cream in your cup
Then blow steam off the cup
We walk down Francis
Hit the 7-Eleven near campus
Holding hands like some kids
Then we wait till sunset
Hit the liquor store on Selma
The neighbor's dog barks from the trailer

[Chorus]
Oh, Violet
Would you wait around with me?
I'm begging you, Violet
Would you stay around for me?
I'm begging you, Violet
The sunset looked violent
Your hair and your thighs are wet
Kiss you on the neck, Violet, Violet

[Verse 2]
You got my shirts in your car
I put a punching bag in the yard
Laundry room flood from the rain
The whistling train, I kiss you again and again
You take photographs from the backseat
Down the back roads in Patapsco
We driving slow, windows are low
Tires are slick from the snow

[Chorus]
And I think of you, Violet
Would you wait around with me?
I'm begging you, Violet
Would you stay around for me?
I'm begging you, Violet
The sunset looked violent
Your hair and your thighs are wet
Kiss you on the neck, Violet
I'm begging you, Violet
Would you wait around with me?
I'm begging you, Violet
Would you stay around for me?
I'm begging you, Violet
The sunset looked violent
Your hair and your thighs are wet
Kiss you on the neck, Violet, Violet

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Begging you, Violet
Begging you, begging you, begging you
Violet
Begging you, begging you, begging you
Violet, Violet

[Outro]
We get older, we both grow
It's hot, it's cold
I want you so
I spent all day on the road
I call you up, "I'm heading home"
We hit the pub
I drink too much
You drive me home
Can't wait to get home
We laugh, we fight, we yell, we take it off
This town's slow, I like it slow with you

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
What's this?

[Spoken BILLY]
It's a letter

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
I can see it's a letter

[Spoken BILLY]
You can open it if you want

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
Thank God for that, the suspense was killing me

[Spoken BILLY]
It's from me mum

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
Your mum?

[Spoken BILLY]
She wrote it for us when I was eighteen, but since I couldn't wait

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
I see

[Spoken BILLY]
You can read it if you want
Read it out

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
Dear Billy
I must seem a distant memory

[Spoken BILLY]
Which is...

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
Which is probably a good thing
And it will have been a long-

[Spoken BILLY]
Long time

[BILLY]
And I will have missed you growing
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh
Missed your stomping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off
But please, Billy
Know that I was always there
I was with you through everything

And please, Billy...

[MRS. WILKINSON]
But please, Billy
Know that I will always be
Proud to have known you
Proud that you were mine
Proud in everything

[BILLY'S MUM]
In everything you do
Always be yourself, Billy

And I will have missed you growing
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh

[MUM & MRS. WILKINSON]
Missed your stomping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off

[WILKINSON]
We weren't born to stand still
Ain't a question of will
Gotta move it's a fact
You were born to react
You weren't made to behave
Like you will in the grave

Where mu-sic is played
Oh the soul - will be swayed
And your feet they will move
As if on - ly to prove
That it was –n't by chance
We were des - tined to dance

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle
Cos we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation
Come on and shake per bootie
Cos we were born to boogie
Anyone can get it
Cos we're born kinetic
Come on and Mash Potat-a
The way God made pa
Your feet and your hands
Oh your toes and your glands
Your eyes and your chin
Your face and your skin
Oh your brawn and your brains
Your balls and your chains

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle
Coo we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation

[BRAITHWAITE]
Come on and shake yer bonnie
We were born to boogie
Anyone can get it
We were born kinetic

Come on and “Mash Potat-a”
The way God made ya

We were born to boogie
We're all born to
We came up from the ocean
In full locomotion
And when we hit the ground
We just danced around
Because they say
It's in the DNA

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
WE'RE-ALL-BORN-TO-BOOGIE!

[BILLY'S DAD]
I couldn't take it anymore son
It was tearing me apart
We're lost, we're finished man, we're through
I need to give the kid a future
I need to look him in the eye
Believe me son I'd do the same for you

[TONY]
But you can't give in now Dad
We've all been out a year
I can never talk to you again
You can't do this to me Dad
You can't do it to yourself
He's just a kid, he's only just a bairn

[BILLY'S DAD]
He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give
And no one else can give what I can give
He could go and he could shine
Not just stay here counting time
Son we've got the chance to let him live
Yes, we've got the chance to let him live

[TONY]
This isn't about us Dad
It's not about the kid
It's all of us, it's everybody's chance
It's everybody's future
It's everybody's past
It's not about a bairn who wants to dance
It's about our history
It's about our rights
Think about the sacrifice we've made
It's what you always taught us since I was a lad
Please, Dad, don't let that passion fade

[DAD]
He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give
And no one else can give what I can give

[MINERS]
We're all in this together Jack
There is another way
All for one
And one for all
Take this and this
And this and this
And this and this
And this and this
Don't worry, lad, we'll never let you fall

[DAD]
He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go

[TONY]
But we'll give all that we can give
We'll all give all that we can give

[MINERS]
We will go and we will shine
We will go and seize the time
We will all have pride in how we live
We will all have pride in how we live
(Yes we'll all have pride in how we live
Yes we'll all have pride in how we live)
We will always stand together
Through the dark and through and through the storm
We will stand shoulder to shoulder
To keep us warm

Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's place for Lucia

Before Armstrong took his steps
She'd been there with friends
They took all instruments and
Recorded on the moon
Gathered variety of sounds
From where the air is different

I'm so full of ideas
And here is a good one
Lucia has a dream
A dream that comes in colour of
International colouring
For your entry she's waiting

Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
Into outer space with Lucia Pamela
The moon is the place where there's space for Lucia
New realities are conditions
Much to little for us to suffer
Because we don't know any better
There are a hundred ways to fall in step

Because for the past two hundred years
The wine drunk and the freedom proclaimed
Oh, are dubious and laughable
Waiting to yield a new use of life
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
Scatter, scatter brained by the sins, sins of silence
A knife to cut the root, the root of ignorance
A knife to cut the root, the root of ignorance

It doesn't matter if you're large or small
Trapezeoid or short or tall
Even if you can't dance at all

All you really gotta do is shine

It doesn't matter if your life's a mess
The whole process will coalesce
Just try to evervesce
All you really gotta do is shine

Everyone is different
Its a natural state
Its a fact
Its plain to see

The world's grey enough
Without making it worse
We need individuality

'Cos what the hell is wrong
With expressing yourself?
What we need is in-di-vid-u-a-li-ty

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Dedication 6, of course
Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga
This pudding taste like the proof, nigga
If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas
Much as we do, nigga, for real

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Six shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'
I'm on a jet and it's mine, I just hope the weather is fine
I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch
The best thing left 'round this bitch
All you niggas some bitches, I feel like Hef 'round this bitch
You call her Stephanie, I call her Steph 'round this bitch
Now back to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come direct with my shit, I come correct with my shit
A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say "BLAOW" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go "bada boom," one of them go "bada bing"
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
Yeah, you know life is a movie, you niggas playin' yourselves, damn

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
That's some six shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt
It's every man for themselves, it's every baby for sale
And you know life is a movie, you niggas ratin' yourself
I just hope it’s a porn to watch you pussies play with yourself
That's some six shit

[Verse 1]
Lookin' through my phone
Messages that I know I shouldn't send
Already sent
We used to be a major chord
You were the third and I the fourth
Stuck in dissonance
Our love a punishment

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I got you cryin'
I got you cryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm wishin' that you would stay
Could you love me one more day?
Like yesterday
And I'm lookin' inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
From yesterday

[Verse 2]
Shackled up just friends
Stuck in dreams of when we were again
I can't begin
Siftin' through the same songs, baby
Lookin' for the one that makes me think of you
The way I used to do
Back when I was your fool

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now I'm cryin'
And now I'm cryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm wishin' that you would stay
Could you love me one more day?
Like yesterday
And I'm lookin' inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
From yesterday

[Bridge]
Lost and so alone
Writin' songs I know that don't make sense
And have no end

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
And I'm wishin' that you would stay
Could you love me one more day?
And I'm lookin' inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
And I'm wishin' that you would stay
Could you love me one more day?
And I'm lookin' inside your brain
To see your mind's already made

[Outro]
(Oh, your minds already made)
(Oh, minds already made)

I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

[Verse 1]
He been gone since 3:30
Been coming home lately at 3:30
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well, just a lil' bit
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe

[Chorus]
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n

[Verse 2]
I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

[Chorus]
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n

[Breakdown]
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

[Chorus]
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n

[Verse 1]
Yeah it’s over, it’s over
I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man this hunger
Feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you said “What’s up?”
And pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you
But we’re always on the move

And now it’s over, we’re sober
Symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger
Last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted
And I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers
'Cause now all I want is you sayin'

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you up
Up
Ooh, I'll take you up

[Verse 2]
I ain't frontin' my intention
Got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention
Got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you
I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, ooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you up
I'll take you up
Ooh, I'll take you up
Ooh

[Bridge]
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Yeah just come over here

[Chorus]
Just come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

[Outro]
Come over here
Just come over here
Just come over here
Ooh
Ooh, I'll take you up

[Verse 1]
Yeah it’s over, it’s over
I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man this hunger
Feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you said “What’s up?”
And pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you
But we’re always on the move

And now it’s over, we’re sober
Symptoms of the culture
And the night ain’t getting younger
Last call’s around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted
And I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers
‘Cause now all I want is you
I'm sayin’

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Yeah, just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high

[Verse 2]
Well I ain’t frontin' my intention
Got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention
Got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you
I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, ooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, just come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Yeah, just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
Ooh, yeah
I’ll take you

[Bridge]
It's alright
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
Just come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 1]
It's a misconcepted
Story from perspective
Lost in a barefoot desert

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 2]
I stand here corrected
Misguided, rejected
Lost in a barefoot desert

[Bridge]
So who am I to judge? Too stubborn to budge
When I'm down here and you're way up above
Shoulda put some shoes on before I left the bus

[Verse 3]
Now I've been neglected
I'm the last one stranded
Lost in a barefoot desert
Why can't I leave? What's stopping me from this prison?
Straight-jacket and shackles at my feet, I'm grounded
Throw away the key for eternity, I'm desperate

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 1]
It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
Helicopter flying over shark bait, shark bite
Cover up, sunburn, leather skin, heatstroke
Make me dash across the amber coals to meet the sea
So cold it freezes me, my teeth are chattering
Give me over to the river, my place that loves me
Gum leaves and tea trees, the river is immortal
I'm parched, I'll cark the salty spray arrests
And no amount of bottled water, could bottle the stress
I think I’ll stop breathing and sink, I'm a boy, I'm not a buoy
I'm paralyzed, I'm paranoid, out of my element

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

[Verse 2]
It's hot, it's mean, the beach, to me
Green grass, won't grow, sky blue, me too
I don't care for cricket, and I don’t care for waves
And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays
So I'll jump into the river when you jump into the sea
I feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet
I lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree
And let the muscle men on the beach, bask in vanity
I shall choose this life for me
Any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water ⁣⁣⁣⁣

[Verse 1]
Superposition, real world wisdom
Everything is moving to the beauty of this system
Total question, fearless reason
We; one; I; many, superposition

[Chorus 1]
Think between space's seams
So your eyes close with my dreams
Where truth exists in thought unbound
You must know your superposition

[Verse 2]
Journey towards true destination
Be in search of real direction
All of a sudden, Heaven's unfasten
The still will dance to superposition

[Chorus 2]
Exist outside the lace of time
And your heart will pump the blood of mine
Trace your finger from birth to hearse
And drink the cum of life
Visualise your worth and see
The place where you'll curl up to die
Be the squid and be the ink
Me the glass and you the drink

[Verse 1]
On the street, people make things happen
Concrete buildings greet the skyline
People meet by the subway station
Feel the heat from the sidewalk pavement

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the sinkhole in the kitchen basin

[Chorus 1]
Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams
Down you'll go
You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street
You follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again
Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

[Refrain 1]
The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people die

[Verse 2]
On the beat, cops patrol the alley
People cheat one another for some
Hanging meat in the butcher's window
Bittersweet stench from in the gutter

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin

[Chorus 2]
Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams
Down you'll go
You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street
You'll follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again
Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

[Refrain 2]
The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people die

[Outro]
Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin
Down the sink
Down the sink
Down the sink
Down the sink

[Chorus]
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

[Verse 1]
I am a rock with eyes to the sky
I wait for my time to arrive
I come to disturb the flow
Dropped by a woman from a pocket in her coat
The great chain of being
Will fall to pieces in no time

[Chorus]
The great chain of being
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)

[Verse 2]
I usurp the precious stones
I have come to take the throne
I transcend the natural flesh
I will lay your god to rest
The great chain of being
Will be un-linked to start again

[Chorus]
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

[Outro]
I see through your world's facade
I decide to punish God
Rocky meteor sparks fire
Burn that goddamn church to the ground
I climb stairs to push you down
I climb chains to cut you down
I disrupt natural order
Bring that sulking lamb to slaughter

[Refrain 1]
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

[Verse 1]
I know within my body
I need rest from muscle ache
I really need a break
So I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

[Verse 2]
I know within my body
I need to locate the switch
Hidden in me which
Will turn me off, off, off
I know within my body, I need it

[Chorus 1]
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it

[Refrain 2]
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

[Verse 3]
I know within my body
I've got sleepy appetite
Pray the darkest night
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

[Chorus 2]
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
We only sleep at the
Wheel that steers us into our future
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future
Our minds unpack, muscles relax
We are superfluous, and in a stupor
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future

[Refrain: Stu Mackenzie]
Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

[Verse 1: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
There's help in need, seek to retreat
Yet we decline without mercy
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
We only sleep at the
Wheel that steers us into our future
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future
Our minds unpack, muscles relax
We are superfluous, and in a stupor
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future

[Refrain: Stu Mackenzie]
Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

[Verse 2: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
Shivering pilgrims, climb the steeper
Path to the idealistic reaper
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

[Refrain: Ambrose Kenny-Smith & Stu Mackenzie]
The wheel that steers us into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future
Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

[Verse 3: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
With hope to prosper, what can we offer?
Our allegiance surely suffers
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

[Refrain: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
The wheel that steers us into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

Mhmm, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, "Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me tonight (Whoa)
I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Hanging out with you guys is enough, I'm starting to do weird melody, weird harmonies
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
"Your love is, your love is," okay
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
Duck and clover, tracks left in my mind
I feel I travel to a place where the sky is purple
And the trees all sway from side to side

Ah, you don't have to worry about a thing due tomorrow
'Cause when the sun is high and the grooving is right
Take a little trip to the riverside
And spend a little money, so you can get high
Until the sun goes down and the river runs dry

Ah, you don't have to worry about a thing due tomorrow

I still wear a sunlight cardigan the type that makes the sun my friend
Don't listen to the angels, man, they'll give you all of their problems

Going green and following blue
The dash lit up as if I queued
With sounds of mermaids in hurrah
Packing my head with every song
I heard a voice call out a name
Could've been mine or a man insane

Fearing what they came here to do

Liquid lie from the sun, Frond

You do it to yourself

[Verse 1]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hopin'
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Buildup]
Come around, come around, come around, come around
Come around

[Verse 2]
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

I'm going home
See my mother

To see my dear old dad

To be with my sister
I'm going home
Won't my brother be glad?

[Verse 1]
Going home, yeah
Going to look out the window
I'm going home
To see what I saw in the past
I'm going home
Where somebody love me
I'm going home
Though I might be in rags
Been so long since
I began to roam
Never should have left home
Thought I was grown
But now I see what it meant to me

[Chorus]
I'm going home
See my mother
I'm going home
To be with dear old dad
I'm going home
To be with my sister
I'm going home and
Won't my brother be glad?

[Verse 2]
Going home
Look out the window
Going home
Do I see what I saw in the past?
I'm going home
Where somebody love me
Going home
Won't my mama be glad?

[Refrain]
It's been so long since I began to roam
Thought I'd make it on my own
All I wanna do is go home

[Verse 3]
Going home
See you mama
Going home
This whole world's treated me bad
Going home, daddy
Put your arm around you
Going home
Ah, I won't be sad
Going home
I've cried these teardrops
I'm going home
I don't know where to roam
Going home
I, I need
Going home
Won't I, won't I be glad
I'm going home
Where the sunshine is
I'm going home
There are no clouds of gray
Going home
See my old buddy
I'm going home
Shake my friends' hands today

[Refrain]
Whoa it's been so long
Since I began to roam
Thought I could make it on my own
But I now see, gotta go back

[Chorus]
I'm going home
See my mother
I'm going home
To be with my dear dad
Going home
To see my sisters
Going home
Won't my brother be glad?
Going home
See my mother
Going home
Kiss my dear old dad, woo
Going home
See my sister, yeah
Going home
Won't my brother be glad?

Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
Waiting in the car
I shed out tears
Right by on the car
I stay up on weekdays for you

Of course I poise it
Of course I did
Of course I have no voice in it
Of course I did

Too young too dumb to turn me low
These bends have fallen to stay on course
Can I hit your end?
Did I demoralize?

Of course I poise it
Of course I did
Of course I have no voice in it
Of course I have no voice in it
Of course I did
Did
Did you like me more
When I was young?
I hid my heart and tried to love
I was incomplete and insecure
I cared too much of what they'd know

Content as can be no end in sight
Nothing's gone wrong so nothing can go right

I refuse to believe it isn't pure
I only wish to make it work
If I could earn you back with just a song I'd sing until I could no more

I need a place to sleep
Place to rest my head
Do you have a home?
Can I stay there instead?
I used to know who you were
Used to call you by name
Unpredictable life is
You can count on change
I can't sleep at night
I wonder tons

[Intro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

[Verse 2]
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby
It was precisely 5.47am on the morning of Friday 31 of December 1999 that a dark spirited pluralist began the dissection of 14-year-old "Baby Grace Blue". The arms of the victim were pin-cushioned with 16 hypodermic needles, pumping in four major preservatives, colouring agents, memory information transport fluids and some kind of green stuff. From the last and 17th, all blood and liquid was extracted. The stomach areas was carefully flapped open and the intestines removed, disentangled and re-knitted as it were, into a small net or web and hung between the pillars of the murder-location, the grand damp doorway of Oxford Town Museum of Modern Parts, New Jersey. The Limbs of Baby were then served from the torso. Each limb was implanted with a small, highly sophisticated, binary code translator which in turn was connected to small speakers attached to far ends of each limb. The self-contained mini amplifiers were then activated, amplifying the decoded memory  info-transport substances, revealing themselves as little clue haiku's, small verses detailing memories of other brutal acts, well documented by the ROMbloids. The limbs and their components were then hung upon the splayed web, slug-like prey of some unimaginable creature. The torso, by means of its bottom-most orifice, had been placed on a small support fastened to a marble base. It was shown to warring degrees of success depending upon where one stood from behind the web but in front of the Museum door itself, acting as both signifier and guardian to the act. It was definitely murder - but was it art?

All this was to be the lead-up to the most provocative event in the whole sequence of serial-events that had started around November of that same year, plunging me into the most portentous chaos-abyss that a quiet lone hacker like myself could comprehend. My name is Nathan Adler, or Detective Professor Adler in my circuit. I'm attached to the division of Art-Crime Inc., the recently instigated corporation funded by an endowment from the Arts Protectorate of London, it being felt that the investigation of art-crimes was in itself inseparable from other forms of expression and therefore worthy of support from this significant body. Nicolas Serota himself had deemed us, the small-fry of the division, worthy of an exhibit at last year's Biennale in Venice, three rooms of evidence and comparative study work which conclusively proved that the cow in Mark Tansey's "The Innocent Bye Test" could not differentiate between Paulus Potter's "The Young Bull" of 1647 (exactly 300 years before I was born, incidentally) and one of Monet's  grain stack paintings of the 1890's. The traditional art press deemed this extrapolation "bullshit" and removed itself to study the more formal ideas contained in Damien Hirst's "Sheep In A Box". Art's a farmyard. It's my job to pick thru' the manure heap looking for peppercorns.

As in any crime, my first position is to pursue the motive-gag. The recent spate, thru' '98-'99, of concept-muggings pretty much had me pulling breath for an art-murder. It was a crime whose time was now. The precedents were all there. It had probably its beginnings in the '70s with the Viennese castrationists and the blood-rituals of Nitsch. Public revulsion put the lid on that episode, but you can't keep a good down. Spurred on by Chris Burden's having himself shot by his collaborator in a gallery, tied up in a bag, thrown on a highway and then crucified upon the top of a Volkswagen, stories circulated thru' the nasty-neon of N.Y. night that a young Korean artist was the self-declared patient of wee-hours surgery in cut and run operations at not-so-secret locations in the city. If you found out about it, you could go and watch this guy having bits and pieces removed under anaesthetic. A finger-joint one night, a limb another. By the dawning of the '80s, rumour had it that he was down to a torso and one arm. He'd asked to be left in a cave in the Catskills, fed every so often by his acolytes. He didn't do much after that. I guess he read a lot. Maybe wrote a whole bunch. I suppose you can never tell what an artist will do once he's peaked. Round this same time, Bowie the singer remarked on a copula goons who frequented the Berlin bars wearing full surgery regalia; caps, aprons, rubber gloves and masks. The cutting edge. Then came Damien Hirst with the Shark-Cow-Sheep thing. No humans, palatable ritual for the world-wide public. The acceptable face of gore. Meanwhile in the US, 1994, I was in town on the night of the Athey sacrifactions.

Ron Athey,  performance artist not for the squeamish - former heroin addict-HIV positive, pushes what looks like a knitting needle repeatedly into his forehead,  a crown of blood, must hurt like hell. Stream red dribble-dribble. No screams. Face moves in pain. Carried upstage and scrubbed down in his own blood. The water. Now dresses in nice suit and tie. Now in black T-shirt and jean, carving, with a disposable scalpel, patterns, into the back of Darryl Carlton, a black man.
Bloody blotted paper towels then hung on a washing line suspended over the heads of the audience Blood-prints from life. An extremely limited edition. When it was first performed back in March. "Four Scenes In A Harsh Life" exploited controversy shrapnel throughout the National Endowment For the Arts. "We have taken every precaution with our disposal systems," an Athey spokesperson said. "The towels containing the blood are immediately deposited in hazardous-waste bags. Each evening, the material will be driven to a hospital for final disposal". Athey says he is dealing with issues of self-loathing, suffering, healing and redemption.

I'm drinking up the Oxford Town, New Jersey fume. Salty and acid. Maybe I can get a handle on this thing back in Soho at the bureau. It used to be Rothko's studio, now the playground for all us Art-Crime folk, AC' or "the daubers" as we're dubbed. Rothko himself, in a dark-deep-drunk one night, carefully removed his clothes, folded them up neatly, placing them upon a chair, lay upon the floor in a crucified position and after several attempts, found the soft blue pump of wrists and checked out. He'd held the razor blades between wads of tissue paper so that he wouldn't cut his fingers. Deep thinker. Always was.

The only names the Data bank can associate with Baby Grace are Leon Blank, Ramona A. Stone and Algeria Touchshriek.
The rundowns are brief but not to the point:

Ramona A. Stone: Female. Caucasian. Mid-40s.
Assertive maintenance interest-drug dealer and Tyrannical Futurist.
No convictions.
Contacts: Leon Blank, Baby Grace Blue, Algeria Touchshriek.

Leon Blank: Male. Mixed race. 22 years.
Outsider Three convictions for petty theft,
appropriation and plagiaries without license.
Contacts: Baby Grace Blue, Algeria Touchshriek.

Algeria Touchshriek: Male. Caucasian. 78 years.
Owner of small establishment on Rail Yard, Oxford town, N.J.
Deals in art-drugs and DNA prints. Fence for all apparitions of any medium.
Harmless, lonely.

Small cog, no wheels. Not much to go on but R.A.Stone weighs heavy on my memory. No problem, it'll come back. Best thing to do now is feed all relevant pieces into the Mack-Verbasiser, the Metarandom programme the re-strings real life facts as improbable virtual-fact. I may get a lead or two from that.

11.15 am

Jesus Who. I hate typing. Anyhow, we've got some real interesting solvents from Mack-random.
How about this! Verbasiser download, first block:

No convictions of assertive saints believed Caucasian way-out tyrannical evoked no images described Christian saints questions no female described christian tyrannical questions R.A.Stone christian machine believed no work is caucasian assertive saints assertive believed female  convictions martyrs and tyrannical are evoked Female described the fabric machine Slashing way out saints and martyrs and thrown downstairs
Now the swirl begins. Now the image stack backs up and takes centre stage.
Ramona A. Stone. I remember this thickness, this treacly liquid thought.
But wait, I'm ahead of myself.

kreutzburg,  berlin

It's two in the morning. I can't sleep for the screaming of some poor ostracized Turkish immigrant screaming his guts out from over the street. His hawking shriek sounds semi-stifled like he's got a pillow over his mouth. But the desperation comes through the spongy rubber like a knife. It cuts the breeze and bangs my eardrums. I take a walk past the fabric machine, turn left onto a street with no name, The caucasian suicide centre, naked and grimy, silhouetted by fungus yellow street lamps female slashing way-out saints for a dollar a time thrown downstairs if you can't take any more. Pure joy of retreat into death, led by the shepherdess. Anti mixed-race posters pasted upon their alter of pop-death icons party people. A zero with no name looks dull-eyed to Ms. Stone, the drone that says "in the future, everything was up to itself". Yes. I remember Ramona. She set herself up as the no-future priestess of the Caucasian Suicide Temple, vomiting out her doctrine of death-as-eternal- party into the empty vessels of Berlin youth. The top floor rooms were the gateways to giving up to the holy ghost. She must have overseen more than 30 or 40 check-outs before the local squad twigged what was going down.

New Yorker Magazine, advanced copy, celebrating fashion. It's a first of its kind since Tina Brown took over as editor. One look is all it took. It took the look and wrote a new book on what sophistaplites would take and bake. Guy Bourdin featured heavily in this new eDISHion. Since the advent of AIDS and the new morality, and, of course, his death, his dark sexy fatal style had fallen out of Vogue. An uncompromising photographer, he had found a twisty avenue through desire and death. A white female leg sticking gloomily out of a bath of black liquid enamel. Two glued up babes covered in tiny pearls. The glue prevented their skins from breathing and they pass out. "Oh it would be beautiful." he is to have said. "to photograph them dead in bed." He was a French Guy. Ha had known Man Ray. Loved Lewis Carroll.

His first gig was doing hats for Vogue. He'd place dead flies or bees on the faces of the models, or, female head wears hat crushed between three skinned calves heads, tongues lolling. Well, it was the '50s, that was it was. The tight-collor '50s seen through unspeakable hostility. He wanted but he couldn't paint. So he threw globs of revengeful hatred at his mobile subjects. He would systematically pull the phone cord out of the wall. He was never to be disturbed. Disturbed. Never. Everything and everyone died around him. One shoot focusing upon a women lying in bed was said to be a reconstruction of his estranged wife's death. Another picture has a women in a phone booth making some frantic call. Her hand is pressed whitely against the glass. Behind her and outside are two female bodies partially covered by the autumn leaves. His dream, so he told his friends, was to do shoots in the morgue, with the stiffs as mannequins, I don't know. I just read this stuff. Now his spirit was being resurrected. We're mystified by blood. It's our enemy now. We don't understand it.
Can't live with it. Can't , well... y'know?

friday, december 31, 1999, 11.30 am

After Surgery and investment in a bullet-proof mask, Ramona turned up in London, Canada as owner of a string of body-parts jewellery stores. Lamb penis necklaces, goat-scrotum purses, nipple earrings, that sort of thing. The word on the street, however, suggested that it was not in the best of interests to become one of her clients as occasionally, a customer would step into her shop and not come out again. The whistle blew after a much-loved and highly respected celebrity, known for being known, failed to show for a gallery-hanging of her mirrors. Other celebrities, equally known for being known, some only to each other, thought it was the most profound exhibit in years and couldn't take their eyes off the works. All the pieces sold within an hour, many for record prices. When the critic for Date magazine asked for an interview with the celebrity-artist, the gallery owner recalled that he hadn't seen her since earlier that day. She'd mentioned that she would be going shopping for a diamond-encrusted umbilical cord as a celebratory thing to announce her pregnancy. She would be back in an hour. Just a quick stop at the "Gallstone". 1986. That pregnancy would have produced a being that would be around 14 years of age.

If it was still alive.
To be continued...?

Girl when I leave I got my feet on the pedal
Ain't no looking in my rear view mirror
I know she loving all the bezels and the medals
But I would never settle cos there's levels to these levels
Keep the diamonds, keep them rocks and the petals
Bitch I used to let it shine out of element
Ain’t it funny how the pot call the kettle black
I'm so done playing with your silly ass
I know I gotta move forward

Bought me a rover then bought me a benz
Forgiato for a young nigga rims

[Hook:]

Walk inside the club throwing bands up
Fuck a bad bitch with her hands up

Ferragamo tuie
Everything is Gucci
Money mixed with Louie
Aye, Make a movie
Yeah, Aye, Buy new rims
Standing in the kitchen getting it in
I'm addicted to that lean I pour a six
Pouring lean, pouring drank
Cashing out when I'm in the bank
Walking round hunnit thousand cash
Grab the IA do the dash, dash, dash

[Hook:]

[Verse 1]
Real fingers from the horizon
A couple thousand from your door
In the pillow that your head lies on
How many fingers more
'Til I put to bed my teenage fears?
Forget about the eyes and ears
I heard it happens every seven years
How many fingers is that from here?

[Verse 2]
Turn your face towards me, mother, I'm afraid
There's fire in the water
There's piss on the grave
There's fire in the water

[Verse 3]
There's fire in water
There's piss on the grave
There's fire takin' all our atmosphere
And I'm here, always barking at the sun in the hole
Hold up

[Verse 4]
I'm Christopher Pyne and I'm doing fine
Hands up for the blind leading the blind
I'm Christopher Pyne too
How, how are you?

[Verse 5]
I lower my eyes to my feet
In holy reverence for those whom I serve
As I drift back, drift back into the earth
Only to rise again in several days
From a fountain in Canberra with another face
And another name
Long may it be the same

[Verse 6]
I'm Christopher Pyne and I'm doing fine
Hands up for the blind leading the blind
I'm Christopher Pyne too
How, how are you?

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie on my wrist (Wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (Aha)

Bossed up and I changed the game (You see me?)
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (Shook)
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked (Hooked)

So tonight, I'm gonna show you off

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]

Nothing can stop us tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I'm walkin' with you

You know it, you know it

[Chorus]
What do you mean?
Ooh, when you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey, yeah, when you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Beat Drop]

[Verse 1]
You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean?

[Beat Drop]

[Chorus]
Ooh, when you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey, when you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

[Verse 2]
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Tryna compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean?

[Beat Drop]

[Chorus]
Ooh, when you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey, when you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

[Bridge]
Ooh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 1]
The deals we made to shake things up
And the rights that they abused
Might just fuck us over
But the doors won't shut until they're sure
There's nothing left to use
Someone's taking over
Threw it away, but now I say
It's time to hand it over

[Verse 2]
The joke's worn thin, the king stepped in
Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over
But the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right
We both knew it was true
The smart ones exit early
And the rest hope for a shoulder

[Verse 3]
If we lose our touch, it won't mean much
If everyone's confused
Which door do we open?
It's the same old trick, they played their hand
Now there's one thing left to do

[Chorus 1]
It’s time (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
One thing on my mind  (Hand it over)
It's rightfully mine (Hand it over)
In the dark (Hand it over)
What's yours is mine (Hand it over)
Mm, make it right (Hand it over)
And give me what's mine (Hand it over)

[Chorus 2]
Oh, this time (Hand it over)
It's yours and mine (Hand it over)
Hey, it's time to hand it over
Just give me what's mine (Hand it over)
Mm, anytime (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
Oh, I need time (Hand it over)
No, no, it's rightfully mine (Hand it over)
Oh, anytime

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five, and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have: I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed him, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin', goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely, and Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral!
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 1]

Standing in V.I.P. a hundred fifty deep
Jelwery all over me I look like Mr. T
My necklace is full of diamonds hell yea I'm shinnig bright
And bitches starrin at me starring so inpolite
What a sight to see tattoo all over me
A walkin work of art I took a lot of ink
Kids want my autograph hoes want my phone number
But I'm so damn conceited gave her the wrong number
No need to speak I rather keep it brief
I took a couple keys 

[? ]
Maybe to you but damn sure not to me
Five hundred fifty a piece now that's a lot of trees

[Hook] (2x)

I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in
Once again, once again, once again, once again
I play to win, I play to win

[Verse 2]

I ride exotic cars, I smoke expensive weed
Yeah, that's the life of Gs and you are not a G
And you can't walk with me because you are not with me
He wants to get in free but he is not with the team
This is not a dream and this is not a game
Step on my denim jeans, is up by 50 grands
Of in the club wgrams
That's a half a pound we blew it like a fan
Nigga I'm the man, women taking pictures
They want to touch my hands they want to hit my swishers
I'm fuckin with you, if you fuckin with me
Cause we just bought the bar, so is ya drinkin with me?

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 3]

I'm in magic city, the center of attention
I'm standing in the light I'm lookin like a tiki
A whole a milli I mean a cool million
Since they know I'm ballin they want to have my children
Want to feel it, do you really feel it?
This isn't just rap is really how I kick it
I'm chillin like a villian cause really I'm a villian
So listen to my struggle I make you see my vision
Like a blind man you can't see the kid
I'm like a deaf man cause you can't tell me shit
Bitches fight daily you ain't fight cases
Got money so out wasted I'm thirty rolling glacier

[Hook] (2x)

[Hook]
Last time I check
Last time thats thats
Last I check I got that scrap
Every time I wake
Every breath I take
Every time I walk

Yeah, I got that checks
Every time I check, yeah, stacks on deck
I use to push that back (listen)
Last time I check I got sticks in my bag

[Verse]

You ain't make a diss record I ain't heard that yet
But like Atlanta Falcons I drop bird shit
Niggas mad cause they ain't got on yet
Your 35 years old boy don't rap
Teenage year boy boy sold that straight
But ain't got the money to your found mixtape
I'm a product of the 6, nigga I'm that shit
So icey real estate, boy your section 8
First time second time third time can't slide
Drop top, chop shop - bye bye, bye bye
I'm Sunvalley shawty, homie ur not I
But if your from the east side must be 2 sides
Got a ninety thousands dollars walk threw the back
Blow handgun shawty chicken Popeye
I got a ninety thousands dollars walk in the back
And my plug filet mignon chicken pot pie

[Hook]

Last time I check
Last time thats thats
Last I check I got that scrap

[Verse 1]

Gucci over do's it, does it the boys perfect
Vette piece fronted, its color scale in the cover
I'm up 900 - Goddamn I spent 100
But that's rap money, when trappin’ that cash nothin'
I'm internet surfin' to a gorrilla in the turfin
G-Boat racin', jet skin' and golfin'
Crazy color Jordans, same color the bought it
Bitch I'm back, I'm ballin', I'm rich hundred regardless
Shrimp scampy odor everytime I fork chick
Trap nigga conversate with a Harvard smart bitch
I'm young rich and heartless, put you on a carton
Cartoon jewelery customized by my artist
6 months lost, got a head start bitch
I was nigga rich ever before I ever got a rap check
Yellow corvette same color bow lett
Pay 20 grands just to get every stone set

[Hook]
Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

[Bridge]

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

[Verse 2]

I'm shittin' on these rappers like I'm wearin' a pamper
I'm sittin' on 500s cause I got it together
Niggas never try niggas that set examples
On cocaine shawty, side to side of the scramper
The port of Miami to the streets of Atlanta
The pinky with the lightstone matchin' yo' candle
Gucci Mane La Flare they call me Gucci Montana
My plug from Georgia, Florida make it Tampa, Alabama
My Mississippi niggas feel me harder then Banner
Haters see my video they switchin' the channel
Gucci got pieces, shawty, go get yo' camera
Gucci time is money, bitch so go get it faster
I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Just cause I smoke your father than your ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin' weed, so you know he's a hazard
Money on my mind, so bitches don't really matter

[Hook]

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

[Bridge]

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

[Verse 3]

Money so big it can't fit in my matress
Never bought the adress cause I signed with Atlantic
Money bigger thirsty then trappin' hispanics
40 in my pocket turn your head into a sandwich
Boss of your boss man, I push the Porsches
Million dollar chain got me feelin' important
Jumped off early and copped me a fork
Makin' mafia money like the king of New York
Gucci go and get it, why them hoes get abortions?
Shittin on a bitch, take a piss on their Jordans
Rap is roverocious, Gucci Mane want the package
Scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamilton’s, Washington’s, Franklin's and Jackson's
Trapper never trip, I just added the fractions
New bitch muggin' brand new mansion
Everything inside from the jeans to my glasses

[Hook]

Big black hollow tips that's what the 6 fit
Haters try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
Dislodged bullets real fast what a chop do
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I tote the Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin' at night, man it might get dangerous

[Bridge]

I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin' off fingers

[Chorus]
Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (Off the lot)
And the heels, I'ma build you a mansion (A mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (Won't stop)
Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (Off the lot)
And the heels, I'ma build you a mansion (A mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (Won't stop)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it was all a dream
I ain't even know what platinum means
Still bought that money, when I was 13
Can't wait 'til the day I'm on the TV screen
When I tell my momma sitting next to me
I wanna be a big movie star
No more sugar that we have to borrow
Open up the fridge and it look like horror
Boy, I can't wait to get them million dollars
Make some, bake some
If I gotta find the recipe and whip it til the cake done
Whenever get the rockin' when MJ gone
Whenever be on top, I be the next great one
I reminisce being broke as a kid
Where I down sit, I don't go wish
I gotta make it
Momma, when I get big

[Chorus]
Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (Off the lot)
And the heels, I'ma build you a mansion (A mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (Won't stop)
Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (Off the lot)
And the heels, I'ma build you a mansion (A mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (Won't stop)
Bells will be ringing this sad sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas

If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear

The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and new Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain

And I'll be happy, happy once again
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
I like the way sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw but she can't take you any way
You don't already know how to go

And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standin'
On the ground

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whisperin' in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standin'
I'm already standin'
Yes I'm already standin'
On the ground

Woo ohhh ooo
What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot

I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out
Your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

Victim of love , I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well

Some people never come clean
I think you know what I mean
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
This ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends
You "been around the world" friends
That talk is for losers and fools

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm no
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong , but I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
Well my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows, I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger
Six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger
Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
All alone at the end of the of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew

You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Tell us what you're gonna do tonight, mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know

God knows, you're lookin' good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have somethin' to loose
Oh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna
Do in those shoes?

Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start

Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews

Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearin' those shoes
They're lookin' at you, leanin' on you
Tell you anything you want to hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove

You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearin' those shoes
Went to a party just last night
Wanted to bring the year in right
Woke up this morning, I don't know how
Last night I was a happy man, but the way I feel right now

It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, aah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

Can't remember when I ever felt worse
Nothing matters and everything hurts
They were passing round the bottle, made me feel brand new
Trouble with the new man he wants a hit too, hit me

It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, aah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

Lord, mmh, funky new year
Nurse I'm worse, funky new year
I got to perk up a little, funky new year
My hair hurts, funky new year
It's going to be a funky new year
Funky new year
Ooh, aah, got to be a funky new year
Funky new year

A party baby
Never again, funky new year
Funky new year
Who's shoes are these? Funky new year
Funky new year
Party hardy baby, funky new year
Funky new year
What year is this anyway?
Sleep all day, out all night
I know where you're goin'
I don't think that's acting right
You don't think it's showin'

Jumping up, falling down
Don't misunderstand me
You don't think I don't know your plan
What you tryin' to hand me

Out all night, sleep all day
I know what you're doin'
If you're gonna act that way
I think there's trouble brewin'
They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance

Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, "Don't come back here, Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance
Every night I'm lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams

We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces
And loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love

I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every morning
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
Oh sweet darling
You get the best of my love

It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

[Post-Chorus]
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

[Verse]
It's in the air, hospitality
Anything you want, what's mine is yours
But don't you worry about the way I talk, woo
It's where I'm from, come and get you some, uh
Hey, all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face
We dance in circles, on and on, do-si-do and then we sway
Even the old folks'll come out and rock
And we just hopin' the music don't stop 'til the next day

[Chorus]
It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Look, every time there's a new sunrise
I open up my eyes
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive"

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Because I'm in love with you
Laying here, in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Look, I can't even get out of bed
With the thoughts you putting in my head
So I say to myself, "I don't even want to try"
Here, every part of me is paralyzed

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Justin Timberlake]
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
I know I got somewhere to go
But I'm thinking we should lay here real low (lay here real low)
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Alicia Keys]
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do
Is hold you tight, just one more, one more night

Juice, juice is temporary, you know. Anyone can obtain the juice or something. I mean, you could say that just 'cause you got a nice car or something, like, "Oh, man, he got the juice," you know, it's something that kind of comes and goes. But the sauce, the sauce is forever

[Intro]
Ooh, sauce
Uh, you got all of it
Yeah
You know, you got all of it
You got all of it
Go 'head

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple
You must be God herself, can I come worship?
Let's make some new details, just for your journal
'Cause you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't
So, go ahead, say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

[Refrain]
Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple
That color right between those, that's where I worship
Let's make some new details up in your journal
'Cause you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't
So, go ahead, say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

[Refrain]
Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

[Bridge]
Four times, huh
Yeah, break it down, woo!
Uh huh
So, so, so, go ahead, say I won't

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

[Refrain]
Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me (over me)
It's always loose screws when you get close to me (yeah)
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

[Outro]
Uh, ooh, sauce
You got all of it, go 'head
Ooh, sauce
Go 'head, you got all of it, huh
Ooh, sauce
Uh, yeah, you got all of it, go 'head

Timbo, JT
C'mon

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 1]
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 2]
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree
They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light (light, light)
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Bridge]
How do I ever explain what I've got with you?
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody ever will understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me
'Cause there's only one me and you
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Outro]
I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand
But you know I'm a Southern man
A man of the woods and you're my pride
Ohh, hey, hey
A man of the woods, it's my pride
Now let the beat ride like...

[Intro]
Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

[Verse 1]
Listen
I see the man, they wanna touch ya
That's when I tell 'em, "Uh-uh"
I guess I am a jealous lover
'Cause I ain't sharin' with another

[Refrain]
Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

[Verse 2]
I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you, you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say, "What's up?"
We both danced to "Lucky Star"
Eyeing each other, then we're laughin'
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over, girl, what?
Ooh, you are that thunder, lightnin'
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done, but
I think it meant to say in trouble

[Bridge]
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing

[Chorus]
You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, more to gain
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, more to gain
Gettin' higher, higher, higher

[Refrain]
Stress is cruel (stress is cruel)
Fame's a lie (fame's a lie)
But you're special (but you're special)
On every level (on every level)
Success is cool (success is cool)
And money is fine (money is fine)
But you're special (but you're special)
Another level (another level)

[Bridge]
Sugar
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
Ayy, sugar
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
Hey
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
It can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
I said come on
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
I said, sugar, come on
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing

You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain

The dreamiest weather
The bluest water and bonfires

I got on rose-coloured glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some us time would be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it though
Set yourself free, in a zone
Ain't got no phone, but don't need it though

Aging like your favorite wine

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Chorus]
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you 'member this, but I was out of town
Flew in on a 3 AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl (okay)
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Bridge]
Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

When I wear his shirt, it feels like, like his skin over mine. And the little holes and tears and shreds on it are, are, are the, the memories of the past that I wasn't there for, but, that somehow I, I, I feel like I understand more when it's against my skin. It's an armor, like a barrier from the world. Like, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know? It makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel...it makes me feel like I'm his
(I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his)

[Intro: Silas Timberlake & Jessica Biel]
Da-da
Da-da
Yeah, good job

[Chorus]
I said, young man
Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be
How they told me
I said, young man, if you wanna make God smile
Make plans, you've got to be ready
You don't understand, right now you're a young man
You gon' have to stand for something

[Verse 1]
Beautiful boy, got it from your momma
Damn, she look good, you might get a sister
By the time you get the picture
If you want a woman this good, gotta clear your system
And it's all right
If you need to cry, you've got my permission
You can do anything in the world if you listen

[Chorus]
Like a young man
Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be
How they told me
I said, young man, if you wanna make God smile
Make plans, you've got to be ready
You don't understand, right now you're a young man
But you gon' have to stand for something

[Verse 2]
We don't ever back down, don't back down
We don't have to act out, don't act out
And even when you fall, don't stay down
If you need me around, you know I stay down
And anywhere you go, you can go your own way
If you ask me how I know these things, remember I once was a

[Chorus]
Young man
Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be

But you gon' have to stand for something

[Bridge]
Someday somebody's gonna break your heart in two
And I'll be there
Someday you're gonna break somebody's heart
That's what we do
One day I'll be gone, son, but right now I'm home
No, you'll never be alone
Maybe someday you'll be talking to your own
Young man, yeah
You know your daddy's so proud of you
My little young man
Mama just can't get enough of you
My little young man, yeah
You know your daddy's so proud of you
My little young man, yeah

Sweet boy

[Intro]
So give me the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Oohh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Anybody can be in love on a sunny day
Anybody can turn and run when it starts to rain
And everybody wishes all the skies were blue
But that ain't the kind of love I'm lookin' to have with you

[Chorus]
So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I'll be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Yeah I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, yeah)

[Verse 2]
My god knows I'm not the man that I want to be
And we all know there's things in this life we refuse to see
So just know my fire for you will always burn
And please forgive the things in this life that I have to learn

[Chorus]
So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)

[Bridge]
No, we won't have to wonder
Oh, you won't have to wonder
If we're ever goin' under
No, we're never goin' under
No, we're never goin' under

[Chorus]
'Cause I want the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff)
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
Cut each other to the bone (break each other to the bone)
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, oh)
Yeah I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff)

[Outro]
Yeah I want the hard stuff
Give me the hard stuff
Give me the hard stuff
Yeah I want the hard stuff
So give me the hard stuff

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

[Verse 1]
When a father's love is doin' you wrong
When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah
But if I'm bein' selfish, that gave me a reason to be there
With my flannel on

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

[Verse 2]
You see, I've been down that road before
And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy
With nothin' to lean on (nothin' to lean on)
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I wasn't staying
I was leavin' with my flannel on

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
The character's in the way you wear it
It takes your shape while you keep it on
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

[Bridge]
Now I pledge you'll never ever be alone
And I pledge these arms and chest are here
To hold you in from the cold

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
Ooh, here's my flannel
The character's in the way you wear it (the way you wear it)
It takes your shape while you keep it on (all you gotta do is keep it on)
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
And may we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

[Outro: Jessica Biel]
Do you see?
Look at all of it from up here
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
Do you see it?
It's in the air
It's in your blood
It's in your skin
Can you see it from up here?
Can you taste it?
Can you touch it?
It's in the earth
It's in the sky
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?

[Intro]
You have to be comfortable with yourself because that's all there is
There's you and nature
Soon as you think you got it all figured out, you know, the wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson
As I'm alone in the forest, I'm one with my surroundings and there's a lot of peace in that solitude
I'll be a mountain main 'til the day I die

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & (Timberland)]
(Living off the land)
And I break my back
And I work all night
At times I do all their work too
It don't break my stride
I just keep moving forward
At times I wish there were two
So I have somebody else that could help me help you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave
If you don’t get on your knees, and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gamblin' it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Why you waste what you ain't got
On that power ball
Has it not quite dawned on you, that don't work at all
See the easy thing to do
Is the hardest thing for you
You just open up yourself
So the truth could come through

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave
If you don’t get on your knees, and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gamblin' it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave

But like her trust, you're gamblin' it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'

You'll see, got what you need
When you're living off the land

[Chorus 1]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Chorus 2]
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back

[Verse 1]
Everything is heightened
We're feelin' vulnerable
I'm makin' you this vow, uh
That you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

[Refrain]
Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah, yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

[Chorus 1]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Verse 2]
And now my circle of friends got tighter
I don't have time no more
Look, I'm only fuckin' with you, for real
And baby, you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

[Refrain]
Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah, yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

[Chorus 1]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Bridge]
Now I know it's late o'clock
And we've been kissin' for hours
When the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows cast up on the mountains
It gives the stars somethin' to watch
Yes I know it's late o'clock, oh
And we've been kissin' for hours
But when the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows cast up on the mountains
It gives the stars somethin' to watch

[Chorus 1]
Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

[Chorus 2]
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back
Likes you back, likes you back, likes you back

[Outro]
Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana

[Chorus]
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

[Verse 1]
Grass is greenest when you're here with me, okay, mmm
If what they got is all good then why would they trade
No we are in the zone and we ain't gonna let it go, no way
(No we ain't gonna let it go, gonna let it go, no)
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away

[Chorus]
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

[Verse 2]
Now the sun dances across the sparkly waves, yeah
While we're canoeing, stoned as "Tiny Dancer" plays
Huff and puff all they want, but this house isn't made of straw or clay
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away

[Chorus]
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

[Refrain]
You and I against the world
(Against the world, against the world)
You and I against the world and everything it comes with
No denying what you're worth
(What you're worth, what you're worth)
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway, uh

[Chorus]
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn, uh
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you, uh

[Refrain]
You and I against the world
(Against the world, against the world)
You and I against the world, and everything that comes with
No denying what you're worth
(What you're worth, what you're worth)
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway
I can tell that you’ve been crying
I can see your tear stained face
I can say thats not the answer
Cause baby what will weeping change

Yes your youth is just a memory
That is how it's supposed to be
But her and I will be forever
Her footsteps follow close to me

Cause you know yeah you know that you're mine dear
Cause you know yeah you know that you're mine dear
Cause you know yeah you know that you're mine dear
Cause you know yeah you know that you're mine dear
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
Double-V.S by the pearls
Closet got more furs than hers
Lotta things I gotta serve
Lotta lean, a lot of syrup
Lotta weed, a lotta herb
Lotta 'didas, lotta girls
If I don't beat it, I'ma curve
Man I mean it, boy I'm serious

[Interlude]
Nah I ain't tryna  fuck with these buck-ass hoes (hell no)
Man, that shit is cut nigga (bitch)

[Verse 2]
I ain't fucking with the birds
Lil' mama work my nerves (shut the fuck up)
Bases loaded, shoutout Ferg
Carti battin', I'm on third
Got a nina, not insured
R.I.P. who got a shirt
Doin' donuts in a circle
Burnin' rubber when I swerve (skrrt)
(Ahaha, fuck that shit, man, uh)

[Verse 3]
Diddy bop, pretty girl
Pretty guy, man, he fire
Keep my pope round my coat
Call my Uber, then I go, run your mouth
Diddy bop, pretty girl
Pretty guy, man, he fire
Run your mouth around the town
Then give me more, give me more

...

[Verse 4]
And I woke up, I told her so fucked, damn
Man last night, nigga, we fucked the club up, damn
Woke up hella late

...

[Verse 5]
Got hits like Drake, got songs like Dre
Nigga, go ape like the clothes on ...
Lyrics from Snippet

Heroin punch, cocaine in her veins
She dancing, acting strange
Heroin punch, I ain't for the games
Smoking blunts, rolling paper planes
What you want?
I'm the nigga, jump up out the Porsche
She wouldn't say it if it wasn't true, wasn't true
A jokes a joke until it fucks with you, is it true
There's nothing I would want to hide from you, to hide from you
Another lie now what am I to do, I to do

Mother I'm trying and I don't know why
It seems I've lost my focus again
It seems like once I think I have it all worked out
Time comes by and washes it down

Strive for what's right I know I can't hide
I know I can't hide these feelings inside
I can't feel this way
I don't wanna say

Just once I think I have it all worked out
Just once I think I have it all worked out
And your expressions got me oh so down
Just when I think I do

I treat you how I wouldn't want to be treated
Do as I say not as I do oh I beg you
Another day another dollar in the bank
Be as I say not as I am oh I beg I beg you
I fear you are not searching enough yet
I fear you're searching in all the wrong places
Well my dear come face to face with what you really feel

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)
Maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the– (and now I got a–)
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)
Maybe it's in the– (and now I got a–)
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe it's in the–
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter)
Maybe it's in the
Maybe it's in the gutter (the gutter, the gutter)

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm wreck-less

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better

What an expensive fate
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Chorus]
If you want to leave me now
Go ahead don't hesitate
'Cause you know I'll fit right in
With every one of your mistakes

[Verse 1]
People with no faces stare
Looking at my every move
I can feel the shadows there
Filling up my whole damn room

[Bridge]
You're so babe I love the view
As you're walking out my door
And you know I'll never ask
Won't you stay for one night more

[Verse 2]
Judging me for what I'm worth
I no longer see the price
And you're wasting all your time
On your search for Mr. Right

[Chorus]
If you want to leave me now
Go ahead don't hesitate
'Cause you know I'll fit right in
Every one of your mistakes

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Take 'em to church, I'm talkin' the tabernacle
It's the return of the body snatcher
Walk in the spot, make my woman smack ya (Woo!)
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's apple
Pull up in the candy car, eatin' a candy bar
And my girl eatin' a candy apple
Yeah (Mm), I line their ass up (Up)
I aim at their goozer (Baow!)
All of these stones on my neck, uh
They must have looked at Medusa
Pockets Rasputia of course
I drove some rims to court
I fucked some twins before
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report
This is the murder, murder, pass the burner, Em (Uh)
Your money shorter than an acronym (Ayy)
Big body when I'm backin' in (Woo!)
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies
Niggas fakin', niggas human traffickin' (Woo!)
I'm on the Act' again, uh (I'm on the Act' again)
This ain't a accident, uh
King like Ak-Ron
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill (Treadmill)
Never Neverland, shit came with a Ferris wheel (Goddamn!)
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car
Most of y'all my sons, aw, look at little JR
F12 same color Kate Moss
Uh, I'm talkin' wristin' the pot
I'm talkin' this and you not
I'm talkin' bricks and you not
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock
This is the equinox, this what the people want
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Verse 2: PHresher]
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
These bitches got flavors
They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor
But they shoppin' at Raleys, they stingin' like tasers
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor
We eatin' that chicken, lobster, potatoes
You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Swagger on ten since a day old
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo
Every track is a K.O., technical K.O. 
Go off your head like I'm Ayo
Out of this world, talkin' NATO
It's 'cause of jail, ho, don't be an A-hole
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so (Lay low!)
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues (Our shoes)
Go nigga, you ain't break no rules (Hell yeah!)
High school, niggas ate yo' food (Food)
Might dumb it down a little, but I ain't no fool (Hell yeah!)
Niggas hate every day, B (Yeah)
Shit is O.C. lately (Yeah)
Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats (Yeah)
Or I might go crazy (Hell yeah!)
These niggas too goddamn lazy (Too lazy)
Don't ever, ever, ever try to play me (To play me)
Lil' shawty now comin' from BK (BK)
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (Like JAY-Z)
Nothin' but love for my idols (Love for my idols)
I feel entitled to titles (To titles)
Fuck it, man, I want the title (I want the title)
Submission, they goin' all viral

[Chorus: PHresher]
'Cause I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (Hell yeah)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plottin' an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent up on a little
Like Osama with a bomb under the bin and down the middle
Of the Pentagon and hit a kindergartner with a rental (Stop!)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
"Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?" (Huh?)
"Why you always gotta smack a whore?" (Huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (Huh?)
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, “'Walk on Water' sucks”
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit
'Fore you heard it, so you formed your verdict
While you sat wit' your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (Chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (Wait, Em!)
But nowadays every flow, every cadence sound the same (Skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why
I write 'til the page is outta space (Duh!)
From 7 Mile in Novara
To "How can I be down?", all of us tryna pile in the car (Yeah!)
We shot for the stars (Yeah!)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (Yeah!)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (Yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (Woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
Well, I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
"Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyoncé this and Kehlani that" (Yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
To the body bag, I'll be back
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like—

[Outro: PHresher]
Like Chloraseptic

[Intro]
Yeah, down

I'm in the club, I'm in the buildin'
10 bottles in, screamin' "I'ma kill them"

[?]
Better get your girl, homie, 

[?]
Yeah, the team with me, the campaign
Double cup, shawty, I do the damn thang
When I'm in the club, tell her drop that down
When I'm in the club, tell her it's goin' down
That's how big my team, we be so supreme
Yeah, I'm in the middle, it's a movie scene
100 bottles of Rosé, yeah, I'm in this thing
I'm the first king
That's on everything

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry

You already know why we're here tonight
So drop that down, drop that down (leggo, leggo)
Drop that down, drop that

[Verse 2]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 yellow bones
Standin' in the club, I don't wanna go home
50 bottles in and you know I'm in my zone
A king on my throne, tell a hater leave me alone
Uh, talkin' bottles of Patron
Shawty took a shot, now she callin' him 

[?]
Real talk, I can show you how we roll
Welcome to my city, put the girl on a stroll
Real talk, boy, I got diamonds in my chain
Everybody round here know the boy name
I'm reppin', rockin' fame, 20 bottles in
2012, year we finna win

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry
Know what to do with that
Take it down, don't rush it
Now go head, drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that down
Girl, stop playin', stop playin' with me
You already know why we're here tonight
So drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that

[Verse 3]
Yo, it's the third verse killer
Shawty in the club, I'ma go ahead and fill her
Your swag's ill but my swag's iller
Your girl right beside me and later I'ma drill her
Yeah, money tall as a pillar
Michael Jackson jacket so I'm feelin' like Thriller
Dudes talk real well, I'ma talk realer
I smoke a lot of weed like my name Mac Miller
High in the cloud like I'm on a propeller
Album came out and it was a best seller
Money on deck, plus the bar is like a cellar
SODMG check, you're a good speller

[Chorus]
Shawty, you in a hurry
Know what to do with that
Take it down, don't rush it
Now go head, drop that down, drop that down
Drop that down, drop that down
Girl, stop playin', stop playin' with me

Drop that down
You already know why we're in this club tonight

Stop playin' with me

Girl, stop playin' with me
(Turn up, turn up, turn up)
Stop playin' with me, girl
(Turn up, turn up, turn up)
The first bomb dropped unheard,
unlike the loudly dropped second and third;
then the final bomb dropped from the sky to the ground
and the last-seen bomb made the last heard sound.

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm not naive I know you're broken
I know you were once whole but now you're broken
You don't know which part of yours been stolen
But what you're looking for?

[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Deeper than an ocean
You gotta go deep
Deeper than the bluest blue
Listen what I am telling you
You gotta go deep, deep. deep
Past your limit
Deep, deep, deep
Til you really fell it

[Post-Chorus]
And I will swim all the way down to you

[Verse 2]
Baby we all have fear for going under
But you can't drink the rain without some thunder
You must travel far to find God's wonder
What you don't dig, for you can't be discovered

[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Deeper than an ocean
You gotta go deep
Deeper than the bluest blue
Listen what I am telling you
You gotta go deep, deep. deep
Past your limit
Deep, deep, deep
Til you really fell it

[Post-Chorus]
And I will swim all the way down to you

Take off

Caught me slippin’, say that I’m trippin’

Tried to keep you, but you wouldn’t listen
Ain’t hard to see I’m with this bitch
But, we came from differences
Offset, she say she don’t roll with a nigga
Got a choppers, light it up Like it’s Christmas

Can't’ trust these bitches, they viscous
Suckin’ dick for a living, no kissing
I’m fucking this bitch in the kitchen
But, somebody walked in my kitchen

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Attention, my baby's coming over
I'ma need everyone to go
Take what you need and get to steppin’
No you don't need to wait up
Traffic, I hear it's kinda crazy
More time for me to clean up
She might think theres something shady
Really, seriously you need to hurry up
If you only knew about the way she drive
You would understand, I ain't fucking around
If she come through the front door, you gotta hide
Gotta hide, she be like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Who this bitch all up in my house?
Why she hiding behind the couch?
Hold on, no nigga, we don't know nigga, don't get up

Fuck around and I'ma lay you out, she like

Who this? Who this is, yeah?
Who this? Who this is, yeah?

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Migos! As soon I was going out
She caught me trippin’ in the house
She got the keys to the door
She caught me smashing on the couch
She ‘bout to put a nigga out
Put a nigga by the house
Saw me and the side chick
So I had to let another bitch in the house
I know she ain’t you
Go, smoke a pound of the reefer (oh)
Do nothing fancy, she lookin’ at my drink (oh)
I pour an 8 in her lean
I got the fire, got a feeling I’m high
I pick up her friend for C.Breezy
She tell her friend that she needy
Fuckin’ hoes like this is easy
I roll you on the floor, just ’Cause I was high (I roll you over)
I was in love by the way she smile
She came to the door,  came from both sides
Before she pull the trigger, what she say?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Who this bitch all up in my house? (Who that bitch)
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Please don’t get the knife)
Hold on, no nigga, we don't know nigga, don't get up
Fuck around and I'ma lay you out
Who this? Who this? Who this is?

[Verse 3: Chris brown]
Know the record but different me, can't even play like I'm innocent
Every night I fuck a different bitch, I'll admit you the one, ain't many different
You fuckin' niggas for fame, bitches heartin' on my Instagram
I see that look on her face, know she gon' fuck her up, she goin' insane
I'm under pressure, came in this bitch, she gon' leave in a stretcher
I shouldn't have let her, I shoulda known better, she gon' teach me a lesson
She in there workin' with the .45 with the compressor
Don't pull it, don't pull it, don't pull it, blood all over the wall and dresser
And if I had the chance would I save her life?
If I never cheated, she wouldn't have died
I don't see no soul, only hear her cry
Yeah, you really thinking that I'm dead wrong

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Who this bitch all up in my house? (Oh yeah)
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Couch)
Hold on, no nigga, we don't know nigga, don't get up
Fuck around and I'ma lay you out
And she like who's this bitch all up in my house?
Whats her name? Whats her name?
Why she hiding behind the couch? (Record you both ‘fore you came)
Hold on, no nigga, we don't know nigga, don't get up
Fuck around and I'ma lay you out, she like (lay you out)
Who this? Who this is? (Who this is, yeah?)
Who this? Who this is?
Who this? Who this is, yeah?
Who this? Who this is, yeah?

[Verse 1]
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time
Role around, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes
Hold myself and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize

[Pre-Chorus]
--- out of this cage
When I'm around you I just can't behave

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
I'm driving in circles, it's hard to be lonely
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

[Intro]
Streets, streets
Livin' in the streets

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Street livin', caught in the trap
Guns or books, sell crack or rap
Be like kings or be like pawns
They called us coons, now they call us cons
Street niggas be packing pistols
Terrorists be blasting missiles
Crips and Bloods and retail thugs
CIA planes bring Colombian drugs in
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to hell
The teachers in my neighborhood can hardly spell
And compared to them, prison guards get paid well
Ten years no bail is four years at Yale
So, forget about the statue of General Lee
Because the status of blacks are generally
Gonna end up in some penitentiary
Systematically, that's how they made it to be
Listen, they derailed the soul train
And put a nightmare in every Martin Luther King
And privatized prisons are owned by the same
Slave masters that owned the slave trade game
And racists no longer have to be racist
'Cause niggas kill more niggas than the KKK did
Now, every time I hear a new def jam
Niggas killing niggas like they Ku Klux Klan
I understand what's a nigga to choose?
Be the killer or be the dead dude in the news
I get it, what's a nigga to do?
No education in the hood got a nigga confused

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Street livin', tough conditions
Brainwashed by the television
We lost in the world we live in
Double cross love lost no religion
Street livin', oh my gosh
Another brother got shot by the searge
Another cop got off with no charge
If you black in the hood, you at large
You're guilty until you prove you're innocent
If you're ivory, they treat you different
If you're ebony, they assume your temperament
Will be vigilant and they call you militant
And you'll get shot and they'll say the incident
Is 'cause you're belligerent, what a coincidence?
Born and bred but you're still an immigrant
And if you ain't dead, you gon' see imprisonment

[Bridge: will.i.am]
There's more niggas in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
There's more niggas that's rotting in the prisons than there ever was slaves cotton picking
So, how we gon' get up out the trap?
Guns or books, sell crack or rap
Street livin', hustle or hoops
Guns or books, get shot or shoot

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Street livin', ain't no rules
Break the law, make the breakin' news
The life you choose could be the life you lose
Niggas getting stuck for them Nike shoes
Street livin', ain't no joke
It's a cold world, better bring your coat
Revoke 'cause the streets are broke
And now they wanna take away our dreams and hopes
Street livin', no economics
No way out of the Reaganomics
Infected by the black plague, new bubonic
No comprende, we speak ebonics
Street livin', what's your position?
You can take action or take a dick and listen
You can get fucked by the system
Or you can say "fuck the system"

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be your little pet
At the edge of every bed
You sleep in, body stretching out
Guess I'll curl up on the couch

[Chorus]
Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees and
Leave me crawling back to you

[Verse 3]
'Cause I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold

[Chorus]
Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees and
Leave me crawling back to you

[Verse 4]
'Cause I don't wanna be your baby girl
That you show off to the world and
When you decide you wanna feel
Like you're living something real

[Verse 5]
I'm not a prop for you to use
When you're lonely or confused
I want a love that lets me breathe
I've been choking on your leash

[Verse 1]
Mary has a heart of coal
She’ll break you down and eat you whole
I saw her do it after school, she’s an animal

[Verse 2]
And she won’t ever love no boy
She’ll treat you like a fucking toy
She’ll break your heart and steal your joy, like a criminal

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

[Verse 3]
Mary keeps you off her mind
She wants to spend her weekend right
Out with her friends just getting high, like a stoner girl

[Verse 4]
And you wait outside on her street
You sit for hours just to see
The girl you pictured in a dream as the only girl

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

[Verse 1]
In the summer
You said you loved me like an animal
Stayed beside me
Just enough to keep your belly full
Then you took me down to the water got your mouth all clean
Left me drowning once you picked me out your bloody teeth

[Verse 2]
Spent the autumn
In the forest hunting for a wolf
Tried to find you
Stopped my searching when the nights grew cold
Dreamt I saw you down by the water with your mouth still clean
You were searching - I came to you and you said to me
That I'm not –

[Chorus]
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while

[Verse 3]
Through the winter
I was shuttered in between my sheets
Checked the window
Just to see if you’d come back to me
The spring was coming, I saw you running down to the creek
A ring finger fell to the water from your bloody teeth
I guess I'm –

[Chorus]
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while
Only what you wanted for a little while

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm all messed up
Took your bottle, poured a cup
I thought that would fill me up
But maybe it's just a flaw
That I've been havin' all along
In thinking love would be that strong

[Verse 2]
Baby don't leave me now
I'm talking to your friends for hours
With slipped in kisses on the mouth
I tried my best to work it out
I took you swimming by my house
Went skinny dipping, rip my flowers out

[Chorus]
And I choose to let it stew
Oh I choose, choose to blame it all on you
'Cause I don't like the truth

[Verse 3]
Baby I lost my faith
I kissed him on the second date
Spent the evening at his place
He filled me with a different name
I should have known that some things stain
Love and lust won't feel the same

[Chorus]
And I choose to let it stew
Oh I choose, choose to blame it all on you
Yeah I choose, oh I choose to let it stew
Oh I choose, choose to blame it all on you
'Cause I don't like the truth

[Outro]
That none of this was you
I guess it's just a-

[Verse 1]
Wasting all my time wondering if you really loved me
I was wasting all my time thinking 'bout the way you treat me
Wasting all my time on someone who didn't know me
I was wasting all my time on someone who couldn't love me

[Chorus 1]
And I knew when I met you
I'm not the one you wanna be with
'Cause I can't see you blossom in the future that I'm dreamin'

[Verse 2]
I'll be spending all my time
With someone who really wants me
I'll be spending all my time
With someone who really needs me
'Cause I found someone who has time
To show me they really love me
So I'm not wasting any time
Even though he's still far from me

[Chorus 2]
And I knew when I met him
That he's the one I want to be with
'Cause I can see him
Blossom in the future that I'm dreamin'
So it's not wasting any time

[Verse 1]
I want to be like your last girl
She's got looks that drive you wild and
Love the way she wears her makeup
She would be so nice to wake up to
She's so sweet
And she's so pretty
Even more than me

[Verse 2]
I want to be like your last girl
She's the sun in your cold world and
I am just a dying flower
I don't hold the summer in my eyes
She's so cool
And the boys all drool
When she leaves with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm just feeling like
I don't have a chance this time
'Cause I don't have a chance this time, I swear

[Chorus]
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything you'll ever need
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything

[Verse 3]
I want to be like your last girl
She's got looks that hypnotize and
She could keep you occupied
I know she still hangs in your mind these days
She's so fine
And she's always nice
Does it drive you wild?

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm just feeling like
I don't have a chance this time
'Cause I don't have a chance this time, I swear

[Chorus]
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything you'll ever need
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything
Why would you still want to be with me?
She's got everything

[Verse 1]
I wanna be the one you miss when you're alone
I wanna be the one you're kissing when you're stoned
Back in the alleyway behind your father's home
I'm clawing at your skin, trying to see your bones

[Verse 2]
I wanna be the one who keeps you up at night
Cling to the memory of how I brushed your sides
'Cause I'm just a puzzle piece trying to fit just right
So I could be someone who's stuck inside your mind

[Chorus]
Falling into my sins
You're still in, you're still in my
Skin, skin
I just wish you also felt like this

[Verse 3]
I wanna be the one who makes your stomach tied
I wanna make a knot and drag you like a kite
'Cause there's a certain pain that keeps you on my mind
When I see your healing skin erase me off your thighs

[Chorus]
Falling into my sins
You're still in, you're still in my
Skin, skin
I just wish you also felt like this
With every kiss
Balled up fist, grabbin' at your
Skin, skin
I just wish you also felt like this

[Verse 1]
Kissed you in the park
We'll meet up after dark
In your car with the backseat, southern summer
Ignored all the missed calls from your mother
And kiss me in the park
We'll meet up after dark
And we'll talk until morning hits the windshield
And paints yellow lines on the field

[Verse 2]
Now you want to start
With someone not so far
Oh she's bubbly and sweet like a Coca-Cola
I watch from my drink as you look her over
The tab don't pop too hard
You're sick of playing cards
With your love, you want warmth and I'm somethin' colder
I'm putting your hands to her heart

[Chorus]
I don't think of my life
Anywhere but in your arms tonight
Won't say it this time
Can't even look back in your eyes

[Verse 3]
Kissed you in the park
We'll meet up after dark
It's a bite of the apple, the touch of your lips
I'm stuck in the bathroom and sick over it
'Cause you're made from the stars
That we watched from your car
And I'm just a victim of changing planets
My Scorpio rising and my parents

[Chorus]
I don't think of my life
Anywhere but in your arms tonight
Won't say it this time
Can't even look back in your eyes

[Verse 1]
Wildflowers don't grow in the city
My heart turns gray and shriveled now
I want to be who I wasn't
I want to dance in my field of blue
A child running for nothin'
I watched you go, my feet were glued

I found God on Sunday
Morning, layin' next to you
My arms stretched out like Jesus
White sheets nail me down to the bed
My heaven burns on Monday
With a broken heart and an aching head

[Verse 2]
Wildflowers don't grow in the city
I dreamt the sidewalk broke in two
The earth was calling to me
A vine stretched down Fifth Avenue
It came in through my window
Carry me home like you used to
Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused

Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain’t nothing I can do?

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?
We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Wish that I could just delete my number
People's problems always weigh me down
All this shit feels heavy on my shoulders
Can you take me out?
Where the music's loud, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Yeah, you take me round, you spin me 'round again
And I can't shut it down, no
All the second times
The second questions in my mind are satisfied

[Chorus: MØ]
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna live my life
I just wanna dance all night
Nothing else on my mind, yeah
Sippin' on cheap champagne
I don't wanna sleep for days
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna dance all night
Nothing else on my mind, yeah
Nothing else on my mind, yeah

[Verse 2: Charli XCX, MØ, Both]
Beating myself up for all the drama
Fuck it, yeah, I'm only twenty-five
Before I start to think about the karma (Oh, no, no, no)
Would you take me out?
Where the music's loud, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Yeah, you take me round, you spin me 'round again
And I can't shut it down, no
All the second times
The second questions in my mind are satisfied

[Chorus: MØ]
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna live my life
I just wanna dance all night
Nothing else on my mind, yeah
Sippin' on cheap champagne
I don't wanna sleep for days
I just wanna dance all night
I just wanna dance all night
Nothing else on my mind, yeah
Nothing else on my mind, yeah

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
And Stevie rest in peace
Pickin' off the last collard greens, stress up outta me

Harlem

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, when you and me lived in infinity
There were two of us, a God of love and a God of evil
Something about polarity - you know, day and night
Black and white, hot and cold, wrong and right, life and death
Polarity, without the opposite we could never be
Now this is all-knowing entity of good and evil
Decided that the place was awfully lonely
So they decided that they would create a world
Of insects and flowers and animals and birds and life untold
Worlds within a world of good things for the good
And evil things for the evil, and there was jealousy

[Verse 2]
Now comes man
Devil wanted to have all the control
But the Good Lord said
"We gonna have to share equally in this here human soul
But we will give man understanding and reason to decide
Whether to join a God of love and peace
Or burn in your eternal fire"
Lord, have mercy and stay with me
Good God said, "I really, I really want to
Love 'em and give 'em all the things that they desire
And bless 'em and love 'em so much and
I got to give 'em reason 'cause I want 'em to come back to me
When the power of evil is all gone"

[Verse 3]
Whoa, some souls are ready to rejoin the Lord of love
Did you ever wonder why a little baby cry when he's born
His soul isn't happy 'cause we got to give up all the sin
But we coming a-home my friend until the soul is ready to be Spirit again
Good Lord don't mind, when you're ready He'll be ready
'Cause time don't mean a thing to these Lords
The Evil Lord don't mind if you're not ready
He wants you to bring your soul to him
It's a power struggle, my friend
A Buddhist monk can burn his body without a flinch
I think he's ready

[Verse 4]
The Evil Lord tempts a man with the things
Heart and the soul and the flesh
That you put on him and desire, to keep him from you:
"I don't think you shoulda did right, you give him too much power
I'll make him destroy all we created - weak and foolish, baby"
And the Good Lord said, "No, no, I know know know
Mankind can feel my love"
And the Evil Lord said
"No, no, no, no, no, no, I want 'em all
You shouldn't have gave him reason
You shouldn't have gave him reason"
'Cause we are the soul to the mind
And the mind to the brain and the brain to the body
Get what the soul desires
And Evil said
"I got what the soul desires for mankind's flesh
Having fun, and uh, I know what they like and
I'm gonna put it on 'em, baby
'Cause your body's really nothing now
But a safe for the soul"

[Outro]
And then the Good Lord says
"You can listen to me, I'm in your soul
Your decision is free
I gave you reason, don't you wanna be with me, do right?"
Walk in the light, I love, baby
(Funk, funk, funk for love)
(Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong
Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong...)

It's the love, funky music and the feeling can't control
Oh no, funky music and the rhythms in my soul
Hey, sweet love funky music and the beats in my head
I love funky music and my lady understands

She can be funky, he can be funky, I can be funky too
With your love
You can be funky, we can be funky, I can be funky too
With some of your love
Home is where you live and play and laugh and be happy
Making love every day
We already know how to blues it

Sweat down my spine, feeling fine
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
Take every chance to make romance
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
What do I have now that is my greatest gift?
And it came to me one day, this is what it is
It's love that I'm looking for, baby, oh darlin'
Said it's love, baby, that I want to be about, oh baby
Hey hey love, baby, that I want to be, ooh
Said it's love, what I want and really need, baby - yeah!
I need your attention, baby, yeah yeah, looking for more love
Honey, do you, do you want me, baby, hey, to give you my love?
Oh, baby

Sometimes I don't need to cry
But there are the pitfalls of life
Here come the tears in my eyes
We accept the pleasure, we, we accept the pain
Ooh, heart, my heart
Oh baby, my heart
Ooh baby, my heart
Ooh, ooh baby, my heart
Come on baby, give up some love

Shake your motion to the East
Shake your motion to the West
Give your heart and your body to the one you love the best
Shake your motion to the East
Shake your motion to the West
Give your heart and your body to the one you love the best

Please let's all get funky if you take the evil
Please let's all get funky if you take the good
Please let's all get funky if you take the evil
Come let's all get funky if you take the good
It's all right baby, to get funky
Oh baby, it's all right to get funky with love's creation, baby
Get funky, baby, funky with love
Now, uh, folks have said the world is coming to an end, baby
I wonder... in our lifetime?
Oh well, let's make love

[Chorus]
Life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
Oh, life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love

[Verse 1]
I will return for all the years
Will rise, baby
I can't admit understanding
Why am I to blame
Nothing 'bout your business
See you on the way
Never been a witness
See me on the way
Oh, tell me what it is made you want to change your mind
Did you say "it's your fault you want to fight"?

[Background repeating]
Very special love
Very special love affair

[Chorus x2]
Life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love

Yesterday, you said you still loved me
Still stringing my poor heart along, baby
But since I been without you
I can see all the things I done wrong
It's not your business
I don't need to know
I know what you're doing
Everywhere you go
I will not forget you
Long as the years pass, baby
Your love was fine, so satisfying
The pleasure was like pure gold, sugar
Now tell me will you forget it
And me filled with reverie
I look back with disassociation
At our history
The good times belong to those
Who really wish to enjoy, baby
I tell all the children
Ours was a love that fell
Oh, tell me what it really was
Made you want to change your life
As far as I can see
You had paradise, you had paradise

[Background repeating]
Very heavy love
Very heavy love affair

I put you on a pedestal
And said I worshiped you secretly, baby
I tried my best to change you
I'm going to admit my mistakes
Just like to the wind

[Chorus]
Life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
Life's a game of give and take
To suppress the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
Life's a game of give and take
To suppress the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love

[Marvin scatting]
Just because you're so pretty, baby
Wondering if I can talk to you
I wonder if you love me
I wonder if you wonder too, girl
Hey, hey, hey
You are the woman on my mind
I believe, baby
Just let me walk you over
Take me to paradise
Oh, sugar
I might love you, baby
Like to love you all of your life
So wonderful, so sweet, so pretty
You got everything that I need
You're so complete, baby
Oh, girl, let me kiss you on your neck
I love you, baby

[Marvin scatting]
I like the way you love me, baby
I like the way that you rub me down
I like the sound of your voice, baby
And when you fool around
Oh, can I come see you now
Love your pretty way
You know, you know I love you, baby
And I wanna be your man
Oh, tell me that you want me
I want to know right now
I think because you're so, so pretty
That I don't stand a chance
But they say that, oh, you got to have some lovin'
Just like everybody else
And I can love you good
I got to think, take care of you, baby
And I know how to do.... Ho!

[Hook]
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, I'm back, bitches, niggas know that, bitches
You've been missin' the game when it come to these rap bitches
You can quote cash for heat, cause she has it
When it come to the heat, she's a eat hazard
His bitch is a cheat, sick as can be
Niggas with HIV ain't sicker than me
But you claim to be the sickest em see
And I can't do shit but laugh at you like you're ticklin' me
Cause y'all niggas ain't tough, y'all fake
A lotta niggas is rough, but so is the surface of coffee cake
Get yo paws and get off my plate
Hook it off, tho can't toss the waves if yo corpse decay

[Hook]
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'

[Verse 2:]
I'm the type of nigga you should praise
The hood luv a nigga like good haze
This is what the hood made
(Applaud Mila?!) I been grindin' since a puppy
Squeeze the.4 beefer, you'll survive if you're lucky
Trust me, you don't wanna see me flippin' out
Nah, fuck that, X, it's time now, I'm flippin' out
Walk with me now, gon' fly with me later 

[?]
Well I been ride or die, it's been fuck a hater
So get the muzzler out, I'm a spit, got rabies
Hard on the beats, street sweep with the ladies
I'll pop a collar, snap a fingers, break yo neck
Now show me some respect, and cut the fuckin' set

[Hook]
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'
We gonna make it, we gonna take it
We gonna get it poppin'
Hits is droppin', ain't no stoppin'

[Verse 1]
You stand on
The edge, you're never getting better
Never getting better
So close that you're shaking
Skin is getting wetter
Skin is getting wetter

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know you thought you'd be fine
It's just one more time
But you've crossed the line, my love
As you start to try to lie still
The dark moods took you
To swallow the pill, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause It's like you're on fire
Tonight, you start to cry
It's in the eyes
As your heart starts to burn
Tonight, I see you fly
You're out of time

[Chorus]
You gotta start moving slower
But you keep on moving on, and on, and on
And your body's moving over
I can see you float up into the Sun
As you start dropping lower
I see your bones are sinking down, and down
And then you find
The other side

[Verse 2]
You start to go under
Tell me, can you hear me?
Tell me, can you hear me?
Your lips are so freezing
I can hear you breathing
I can hear you breathing

But you said you were walking through dreams
And watching us scream
You float out of reach, my love
And now the sky starts to turn black
You're under attack
We can't pull you back, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause It's like you're on fire
Tonight, you start to cry
It's in the eyes
As your heart starts to burn
Tonight, I see you fly
You're out of time

[Chorus]
You gotta start moving slower
But you keep on moving on, and on, and on
As your body's falling over
I can see you floating off into the Sun
As you start dropping lower
I see your bones are sinking down and down
And then you find
The other side

[Outro]
'Cause it's like you're on fire
Tonight, you start to cry
It's in the eyes
As your heart starts to burn
Tonight, and then you find
Your other side

[Verse 1]
All you wanna do is stay and fuck me
All I wanna do is stay at the party
All I wanna do is move my body (body)
All you wanna do is watch the TV
All I wanna do is get down and freaky
All I wanna do is move my body (body)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired of the things you do
I wish you'd shut up, get down
Get loose and get dirty

[Chorus]
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty

[Verse 2]
All you wanna do is watch your clock tick
All I wanna do is play loud music
All I wanna do is get intoxicated (baby)
All you wanna do is sit on the sofa
All I wanna do ride the rollercoaster
Seven nights a week, let's do it over and over again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired of the things you do
I wish you'd shut up, get down
Get loose and get dirty

[Chorus]
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty

[Bridge]
You know I've tried so hard to get clean
The party scent is clinging to my skin
I guess there's nothing else left for me
I'm gonna have to stay so dirty

[Chorus]
Get loose and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty
Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-get dirty
Get down and get dirty

[Chorus]
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Mine

[Bridge]
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry

[Chorus]
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 1:] Ooh bitch, what it is, fuck it up gon' take a shit fuck it up
oh god what it is fuck it up, gon' take a shit,
What it is, fuck it up gon' take a shit fuck it up oh god what it is fuck it up, gon' take a shit.

[Verse 2:] Hope the water don't touch my dick, Hope the water don't touch my dick, Hope the water don't touch my dick, my dick, my dick. Hope the water don't touch my dick, Hope the water don't touch my dick, Hope the water don't touch my dick, my dick, my dick.

[Verse 1:] Ooh bitch, what it is, fuck it up gon' take a shit fuck it up
oh god what it is fuck it up, gon' take a shit,
What it is, fuck it up gon' take a shit fuck it up oh god what it is fuck it up, gon' take a shit,

[Verse 2:]Hope the water don't touch my dick, Hope the water don't touch my dick, hope the water don't touch my dick, my dick, my dick. Ooh Bitch.

My...
Oh baby
Listen

Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
'Cause when you think only of yourself
You can't love anyone else
And I need you desperately
But with your head in the clouds you can't see me
So tear it all down

Tear it all down

Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
In order to live life
In order to work
You must first come down to Earth
And I want you to give in
'Cause my love is so strong, it can win
So tear it all down
Tear it all down
Let it crumble to the ground

It's just a masquerade
So why don't you let it stay
How can I show what I need
When you got your pride standing in between

Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
'Cause it will strip away one day
But my love is here to stay
We can make it, of that I am sure
But you just got to give a little more
So tear it all down

Tear it all down
Let it crumble to the ground
Got an awful hurt in my lonely heart
It's about to drive me crazy since we've been apart
I've seen seven doctors but they can't help me
They said that I'm in trouble
And it's love I need

Since you've been gone
It's been so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

Darling, doctors can't help me
Love I need
Going crazy
Love I need
You can save me baby
Love I need

Can't go on, in this loneliness
When you took your love, you took my happiness
All these tears in my eyes won't let me find my way
And this aching in my heart is growing every day
C'mon home
It's so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

It's love I need
Darling, doctors can't help me
Love I need
I'm going crazy
Love I need
You can save me, darling
Love I need

Got an awful hurt in my lonely heart
It's about to drive me crazy since we've been apart
I've seen seven doctors but they can't help me
They said that I'm in trouble
And it's love I need

Since you've been gone
It's been so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby
Love I need
Doctors can't save me
It's your love I need
And I'm going crazy
I need your love
Darling, why did I agree to ever let you go?
And why did I promise I'd never try to see you no more?
I thought I could find someone to take your place
Instead I find memories of you so hard to erase

'Cause every now and then
Someone speaks your name
Every now and then
I feel the flame
Same old burning
Burning deep within
To a dream I'm holding on
And all the time I know you're gone

Some times I sit alone and stare into the night
And in my mind I see myself holding you tight
Seems the love I feel is stronger than my will
Trapped in a world of despair
I close my eyes and pretend you're there

'Cause every now and then
I hear your voice calling
Every now and then
Girl, my tears start falling
Darling, beyond my control
I miss the mess of your touch
I miss the love I need so much
Every now and then
Every now and then
I keep remembering

Won't you come back baby
It's so hard living without you
Why don't you come back, baby
I miss everything about you

Why don't you come back
My whole world is crumbling
Why don't you come back
Every step I take without you, I'm stumbling

'Cause every now and then
I feel the hurt inside
Every now and then
I get you on my mind
Of fools of thinking I get over you
And every street I'm coming down
I see you all around

'Cause every now and then
Every now and then
I feel the flame burning
I feel my heart yarning
Every now and then
Oh I miss your touch
Every now and then

[Marvin speaking]
You know, not so long ago
People used to have these tales
Going back and forth about who
Could make the best love
These things get a little out of hand, baby
You know what I mean
I'm just trying to straighten this thing out, that's all
I wanna tell everybody like it really is

[The Waters]
It's getting bigger
It's getting bigger

[Marvin]
Savage, baby!
Savage in the sack
I won't hurt you, darling
I just wanna show you where it's at
Love so good, baby
Like you know I would
And all the time
Savage in the sack
Not too long ago, I told a friend
I ain't had none
Since you and Lord knows when
Stayed up for days
Never been satisfied
Soon as I get ya, baby
I'll make you cry
'Cause savage, baby
Savage in the sack
I ain't gon' hurt you, darling
Just gon' show you where it's at
Hit me
Feels so good
You know you got to love it
I know you would

Look here
You know where it's at
Sooner or later, baby
Get you back
You know where you gon' get it
Come with me so we can get down
Savage, baby
Savage in the sack
We ain't gon' hurt you, darling
Just wanna show you where it's at
Hit me
Hit me, baby
Like you know we would
Hit me
Savage in the sack
Ain't gon' hurt you
Know you need me
To be released
And don't tell nobody, baby
Unless you don't call
I'm gonna leave
We're savages!
Savage in the sack
We love it, we love
Got to get you back
Scream! You savage!

[Chorus x3]
Ain't it funny
No it just ain't funny
How things turn around
How things turn around

Once we loved each other so deeply
We talked to each other so sweetly
Now, we don't even talk at all
Only, only on the telephone

When I call
Talking about the kid
Talking about the baby
Talking about the baby

People think life is a game
Life is a game
People think life is a game
They think life is a game, baby
Ain't it strange? It ain't never the same
Gonna turn around, baby
Turn it around, soon
Gonna be getting down
Got to turn around, going to turn it around

Please, please don't ever go away
And if you wonder, please, please
Don't ever go away

If we work together, we can help things turn around
Can't we baby?
Ain't it funny, baby
How things turn around, baby
Ain't it funny, baby
How things turn around, honey, honey
Ain't it funny, how things turn around
Look at you, baby

If we work together, we can help things turn around
Can't we, baby?
F-U-N-N-Y, help it turn around
F-U-N-N-Y, help things turn around
Ooh, baby
Look at you, baby
F-U-N-N-Y, help things turn around

[Outro]
F-U-N-N-Y
Turn it all around, baby
This is a story, about life
Mostly, about my life
And ooh, people, I want to share it with you

If in some way I can help someone
Maybe someone is lost and needs to see the light
Oh listen, people, I have a story, a life's opera

Get down, they never said we couldn't get down
Long as 

[?] fun sometime
Get down, they never said we couldn't get down
Long as 

[?] fun sometime

Oh babe, this is it
A song about life, oh baby

[?] listen to my song
For all those who feel they want to know the way, aw babe

Listen (Listen) to the truth
Listen (Listen) to the way
I see you, Jesus (Jesus) and Buddha (Buddha) and Jehovah (Jehovah)
And Martin (Martin) and Malcolm (And Malcolm) and all men who knew the way
All men died for you
Listen (Listen), listen (Listen) and understand (Understanding)

[?] and I'm sure the truth will live
Listen (Listen) and see (Listen)
That your life will be something greater than (Listen) you ever expected to be

Call on the Lord (Get down)
Oh, hear me (Never said we couldn't get down)
The Lord will 

[?] (Get down)
Listen my brothers, listen my sisters (Never said we couldn't get down)
Oh, love the Lord
Lalala Amen ah

The devil is trying to do his work
He'll make you feel like it's righteous
Give you justification
Oh but you gotta look through and see the light there
You can't make wrong right y'all
You see, there got to be two sides in all the balance, oh yes it is
Stood up on the line and choose your side
Maybe it'll take you a little longer, babe, understand what's right
Oh but I believe 

[?] (I believe...yes, I believe)
I believe all these dreams will come true someday (I believe...yes, I believe)

Maybe the way you don't realize, oooh
(Marching) Brother, keep on marching (Marching, keep on marching, marching, marching, marching, marching)
Keep on marching
What they died for
Don't forget, don't forget (Moving)
Keep a tear in your heart (Moving, keep on moving, moving, moving, moving, moving)
Oh keep on 

[?]
Closer to the light
Oh people, you know (People)
Said it from my heart
Keep on marching, marching, marching, marching...marching
Closer, closer to God, you'll save me
Oh yes you will

[?]
Our Father which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
Oh Father, on earth as it is heaven
Give us this day, Jesus, our daily bread
Oh Father, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
Lead us not to temptation, Jesus, but deliver us from evil
Oh Father, light, kingdom, the prophet Lord Jesus forever and ever Amen
Mmmmmm oh yeah, oh Father
Let's rock this shit

I don't know if all Boy Scouts are gays
They could probably tie the knot in, like, fifty different ways
I got a safe full o' cherries, 'cause I pop it and lock it
A girl's like a fridge, once a week, you should stock it

Girl, if you're into rimmin', it's only safe if you're swimmin'
But, girl, don't sit on that couch 'cause I treat my objects like women
I spit fire like I just blew a demon
My shit's so hot, I'll leave your toilet bowl steamin'

I'm gonna tear it, like the cards of the gypsies
You'll bleed for so long you'll get monthly ellipses
If your pants are loose, I'll replete ya
You're a first time vegan and it's nice to meet ya

I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
I'm a real G-shawty that can really find your G-spot
Woah, yeah
What the fuck's a G-spot?
Go to a vagina orchard, count one, two, three
Spin that plant around you got a third-world country
Yo, that's right, consider yourself warned
I'm offensive and creative like handicapped porn

You're playing with your breasts, excuse me, can I try it, ma'am?
You're pushin' 'em together like a titty venn diagram
Look at that crack, excuse me can I buy a gram?
Right below your diaphragm
Ass looks like you're hidin' ham

First base, we're making out
Second base, I'm getting faked out
I said, third base, I'm getting take out
And I'd try to take it home if I knew I'd take it out

But I just don't know, I said I just don't care
I said my flow's so cold I need a tampon from a polar bear
And you can spell and smell my stink
B.O. lingers and it makes you think

'Cause I'm Bo yo
And I'm the greatest rapper ever
And I'll weather your weather whether you think I'm clever or not
Think you're better, you're not
Don't need a sweater I'm hot
I'm a real G-shawty that can really find your G-spot
Woah, yeah
Provided that you point me in the general direction
'Cause girls are like donuts when I be bustin' Bo nuts
I can make 'em cream-filled or give them a layer of glaze
I'm like Doug's friend Skeeter whenever I meet her
Because I skeet her so hard people call her Patty Mayonnaise

Yo

Hey, my girl is epileptic 'cause she's the one I'm jerkin with
Come on, you Asian child-laborer, show me what you're workin' with
Ooh, large machinery

'Cause there's an inverse relationship between respect and sects
I'm talking 'bout religious sects, like a Mormon sect
That says you can't have sex with members of different sects, but you can't have sex with members of the same sex
So if the sects can't be different and the sex can't be same, then the only sex left is some left-hand shame
And girl I left you 'cause you left the game
And if that don't feel right, then you can write my name

'Cause I'm Bo, yo
I'm the greatest rapper ever

Don't need a sweater, I'm hot
Somethin' about a G-- whatever

Yo, I said my junk's so long that it hangs and swings
So at the nude beach people think I'm lookin' for lost rings
Play the skin flute, your big boy sings
If you want to take it all, wear African neck-rings
It makes your neck long-- 'cause my dick--
Haters call me gay, but that ain't hatin'
'Cause I'm not homophobic, my morals are straight
And if I'm in the closet, then you are below me
Taking the B-A-T out of basement, homie (Semen, it spells)

'Cause I'm Bo yo
Okay, on that note, I'm gonna rap

[cheering]
Heh, yeah

Walkin' my poodles, man it never gets old
With my dogs on my leash I got bitches on the hold
A first aids kit? That's a rhesus monkey
I bust more nuts than a pistachio junkie!

I get more ass than a giant donkey stable
I got more lines than Whitney Houston's coffee table
I get more head than grammar school lice
I'm like a walkin' glacier I'm so decked out with ice

Hey, Jesus loves you as long as you're white
Did you poop a virgin? cause that shit is tight
Hey, I'm blowin' up like I thought I would
I'm circumcised 'cause I don't come from the hood
Yo, I do drugs in the bedroom, lie on your back
Cause I got the pipe and you got the crack
Though I'm sexually straight, you're bound to find
I'm mentally gay, cause I'll blow your mind, ma'am
Yo, the parents be snickerin', "He shouldn't have written it"
But I'm constipated, couldn't give a shit
What, motherfucker?
What, yo
Yeah, this kid's a virgin
My name is Bo
My name is Bo fo sho
A born Bostonian
Aryan librarian at the wordsmith-sonian
The rap is scattered, it hides its ingenuity
I gave it this little part to give it continuity
Uh, fuckin' feel it yeah
Yo, huh? Where are we? Yeah

And the fellas say
Hey moron pass the gin
Cause I'm an ozymoron breathing oxygen
Give me the bottle, I'll chug two-thirds
'Cause you bitches know fractions speak louder than words

And the ladies say
Hey fellas I'm keepin it tight, and if you play your cards right you can have me tonight
Should I blow you or beat you, brass or percussion?
Oh, stop, period, end of discussion

Yo, my name is Bo fo sho
A born Bostonian
Aryan librarian at the wordsmith-sonian
The rap is scattered, it hides its ingenuity
I gave it this little part to give it continuity
Walking through the garden, food at my feet, picked up the celery but dropped the beet
Yeah
And then I picked it up, and it-
There's music, it gets faster

Alright, let's end this

We're in the hood, I'll take what you give me
Was Einstein's theory good, relatively
A smart queen's kingdom, it doesn't mix
A litter of literates, a bunch of Moby Dicks
"Get thee to a punnery" oh, just Ophelia
Take you with a condom, stainless steel ya
Half a pound of turkey breast, half a pound of chicken tits
Why are only crackers staying at the Ritz?
Poverty, racism, isn't it strange
That only the homeless are beggin for change?
I shocked Sherlock
What, son?
Rosa Parks didn't call "shotgun!"
Here's a little bit of irony
A Ford Focus driver has ADD
How'd I come to master all these things?
Like a tampon thief, I had to pull some strings

[Eminem]
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them

[Evanescene] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Notorious B.I.G]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make
(I repeat)
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal

[Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake

[Evanescence] (x2)
I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal
So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb

[Chorus]
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance

[Verse 1]
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playing on the radio
Let's sway
While colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would tear my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

[Chorus]
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance

[Verse 2]
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would tear my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

[Bridge]
Let's dance
If you look into my eyes
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Under the moonlight
Let's dance
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's sway
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's sway
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's sway, let's sway, let's dance

[Verse 3]
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing on the radio
Let's sway
While the colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
Let's dance
Fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all, is all, is all, is all
Let's dance

[Outro]
Yeah, really
That's, that's it, that's it
Got it, ha, got it
There are things we can't control, learning to let go ain't easy
I've watched the tide rise and fall
And it doesn't phase me
I must let you know it doesn't get easier, no not easier
I must let you know it doesn't get easier
But still we try

We can't
Go back

But why would you want to?

There are things we can't control
I'll let you know when I get past that and
Tell me where my dreams will go
If they fall into a million pieces

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be the reason we don't get down
So I'ma let you do the leading and follow you now
See, I just don't usually do this
But you're bringing me out
All the doubts I had have gone away
When you're touching me I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want, will you stay?
I just wanna be your girl
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
Cause you got my heart on lock
It's so unreal, you know
Don't want this to stop
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

[Verse 2]
I didn't even see you coming
It was such a surprise
I wasn't expecting nothing
Now I'm lit up inside
Your bringing out all the colours
No more black and white
You won the race and got the gold
So here I am, we're good to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Knowing this ain't going away, here to stay

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/claude-kelly/-/abracadabra.html]

I don't wanna take my time
I don't wanna wait in line, no
I just want you by my side

To feel only wanna feel your head against mine so
When things get down take me there

Stay yourself
You stay yourself

Two words: lil nigga; small feet, short arms
Lil Wayne, Weezy Baby, motherfucking Hot Boy
Pop me, hate me, I’ll be right there
Two more: Young Money, Cash Money millionaire
Two words: Uptown, one-seven, rep that
Nine-six, young me, Front Street, wet crack
Two words: black shit, black card, black fit
Back door, black gun, black clip, silver bullet
Red shit, headshot, dead quick, sad death
If anyone said shit, everybody snooze
Two birds, shaved them, turned them to pavement
Drought come, raise them price tags, break them
White flags, wave them high if try him
What? Why? Three words: “Die, nigga, die”
Two words: two-seaters, two blunts
Two thirds of the time, Reel with me
Singing like a hummingbird
You heard shit right, Carter here, get right
Niggas better hold on, bitches better sit tight
Two words: high-yellow, long hair, thick size
Sixth side, naughty girl, good girl, Uptown
All-time playa playa, good game, hood rich
Don’t be fooled, got tools like Goodrich
Two words: blap-blap! Aftermath, white sheets
After that, clear block, ghost town, white streets
Still going, won’t stop, paid quick, never that
Hot Boys, as a group, nothing can compare to that
Two words: bounce back, bounce-di-bounce back
Dig this, bid that, how you loving that?
Power move, yeah, Dizzy, get dough, get more
If not, what we spitting for? Shit
Prada cap, Prada jeans, Prada kicks, Prada sack

Sending y’all bitch niggas to two words: Hell or Heaven
Better tell the reverend and confess to your sins
And hope God forgive the fake shit that you did (Pussy)
Downtown, Uptown, stand up
Bitch niggas, man up; M-Zone, that’s us
Big gun, two clips; lil’ gun, few tips
Dum-dum, flip-flip, numb-numb, stiff-stiff
Yeah, it’s like back-back and forth-forth
Snap back the four-four and *pap!* at your throat
No yap-yapping no more, fuck who hates me
I live by two words: “Fuck you, spray me”
Yeah, yeah, what? Who? Wait, we
Come through eight deep, everybody move!
Damn, bam, what’s loose, ain’t me
Takeover games …

[Intro]
Yeah, Mr Biggs
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Yeah, well not because of my size
Hey, yo, hey, yo hey, ho, haha
I might as well get me a bitch to say my name on all my songs

[Verse]
Nigga, I'm young as a motherfucker
But money a motherfucker
Young Money motherfucker
Get it in blood puddles, shit
I'm in the South, where we livin' in mud puddles
Shit is a drug struggle when you niggas uppin' prices
I hug the Glock like a turnbuckle
Can't get stopped by the vices, no license
Rollin' like dices on the streets
Where the odds is high
Where the crime is life
And the life is time
And the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin'
The judge probably hit me wit an algebraic expression
But I get away free like Ocean's 11
And I motion the metal
Like a pro-fiessional
And I'm rollin' especially like a pimp supposed to
Watch how you sit down, something's in that sofa
If she wit me, you know that something's in that hoe bra
She's a foreigner, so she say coca
I get broke off, and they get brok-er
They like "so what?"
I'm like "so when?"
We gon' know then
How to turn in, turn out
'Cause we gon' shoot back
'Till the burners burn out
'Till the burnin' burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollerin' at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me, there's a thousand blindfolds
And my mindstate, is put a thousand on top of those
I do school and do lunch at Pappadeuax's
They want beef, I turn that to sloppy joes
Copycats brrrrat, copy those
I got a strong relationship wit expensive clothes
This stuntin' shit is extensive and intense
Like pullin' up in somethin' Americans can't invent
I make 'em fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence
Shit, I'm way smarter, man, I'm more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
I'm so, I'm so so, I'm so lifted
High in the sky, me and pops takin' pictures
That's my vision, until my vision is vivid
I'ma give it all I got
We good, Jigga? You bitches!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Hey!
Look up baby, they write my name in the sky bitch
Don't forget the baby is what I tell her prolly
Don't forget the liquor store is what I tell the driver
Twenty dutch masters and straight level vodka
I can pedal backwards and still move forwad
Look under the matress, you might find four of 'em
I can go though the atlas without tourin'
I can fuck an actress and never been in movies, chea
I'm a cutie
An offspring of mamas beauty
I did overtime, I took papas duty
I'm a man in every sense, I got sense
Since I got rich, I got tents on every Bent
Since I know tension come out them like vents
I vent, and show no relent, money well spent
I'm a hell raiser, blaze a L
Right in front of the laws
I'm tougher than ya'll
Never really had a pop, so I never had to check in
But I get enough checks, I fuck around and check him
Look, check him out, these is Evisus
America ain't even let them out (ha ha)
I'm feeling great, I'm steppin' out
Take ten out
Brrraagh, chest is out
And I don't leave parapaliegics
I squeeze it
Until I see your spirit rise with my own eyes nigga
I'm on mine nigga
I got this like a bitch got time nigga
And I'm the dime type
And I'm walkin' in the lime light, still like lime
They talkin' in hinesight, I'm right now
I pull up on your shawty like SKRT
Tryna hop up in this Maybach, I walk way back girl
Come up out that gear asap girl
Whisper in your ear thats Wayne pussy, say it back girl
Now she in th whip wit homes
He listenin the same songs I fucked her on, yea
I lay back, I'm comfortable, yea
Weezy baby boy, lazy boy, yea
I did my service in the Navy
Now I'm just a veteran, they forever pay me
Dig me like a shovel
Mama I'm a rebel
I come from under that rock and turned into a pebble
Baby I'm trouble, so turn up the treble
You say it's clever
I call it whateva

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Holla at ya boy its Weezy Baby
They label me a problem
And I probably am so I dont knock em
I pop up in a broccoli Lam' on choppers
With an ol' school bitch, she got on door knockers
And she knock on your door for that raw partner
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked for a Mazda come back in Mase-rati
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Tryna be monogamous but I got bitches on my dick
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
So I only promise this: to my little girl I will give you the world
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
Yeah, and for their sake I'm a ball every year
I'm a pause every tear
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know, that I got that black music on my waist
Make me put it to your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
Mama can't remember shit but last saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Powder in my nap sack
Running through the projects, tryna get a stack back
I got my SK bout to get my MAC back to pap pap at niggas who yap yap
Yup yup! and I rep that 17 hard, you know
'til a nigga ain't nothing but tomb quotes
Raw Tune, who you know go harder than dude
See these is the clues, part of my shoes
I bleed with them dudes I'm part of the crew
Don't move cause you right in the route of the gun mouth
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Nigga y-y-young Wayne from out Carrollton
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
Though my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
Automatics up, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get fucking bleached
Above the law niggas put you underneath
You call the law nigga? You fucking leech!
You Saved by the Bell, you fucking Screech
My bucket screech through the streets like a R&B singer
You ain't pimping until you fuck a R&B singer
I walked in this building with all these bangers
And all these niggas look like targets to me
What's a drought to you may be a bargain to me
Cause I just may be sitting on a carton of Ki's
I got important people thats trying to market me
So I'm gon' stop talking 'bout the white, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I'm swinging with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a blow all day, and I'm a blow all night
Do a verse today and do a show tonight!
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I might go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Cause your prayers maybe working, mama they gon' try
Yeah,and we rock to the same lullaby
Nigga I got 10, nigga I got 5
I hope you got yours, cause nigga I got mine
I'm goin for the green bitch, Its popeye time
So I can be a paid nigga, and make that tomb stone say "I'm a made nigga"
I'm a made nigga

[Mary J. Blige cover]

[Intro]
I'm not a singer so I'm going to give the best vocal performance I possibly can. Off the couch. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Time on my hands since you've been away girl
I ain't got no plans, no, no, no, no
And the sound of the rain against my windowpane
Is slowly, slowly drivin' me insane, oh

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Verse 2]
Sleep don't come easy, oh please believe me
Since you've been gone everything's goin' wrong
Why'd you have to say, "Goodbye", look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from fallin' down my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down (haha)
I'm goin' down
You ain't around, motherfucker
My whole world's upside down

[Bridge]
Baby love
(Don't you try to hand me the lyrics)
Baby love
Baby love
(Hold them up for me)
Goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm from Queens motherfucker
And that's it, take 'em home
Take 'em home fellas
Young Mac, young Dom, young Fred, young Paul, young 

[?]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
You ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

Thank you, thank you, thank you very much
That was beautiful, what a rendition
Phenomenon, phenomenon
Roll up your filthy sleeves
The pulpit's up here waiting
Sleep is my enemy
I'm more productive when I don't have any rest so
Take a good look at me
It might be your last time

Why can't (no no no)
Why can't (no no no)
Don't ask (no no no)
Why can't (no no no)
Don't ask (no no no)
Sit down (no no no)
Why can't (no no no)
Sit down (no no no)
Discipline

Sweetie come back to me
The father's watching gladly
One day you'll have to leave
I beg that you pray every night when no one's watching
Rituals are comforting
But only when you choose to believe
Why can't (no no no)
Why can't (no no no)
Don't ask (no no no)
Why can't (no no no)
Don't ask (no no no)
Sit down (no no no)
Why can't (no no no)
Sit down (no no no)
Time to discipline

Don't you know it's bad for me
To live with the shit I see
Maybe I was right to...
They say good comes to those who wait
Well I've been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, way too long
I refuse just to let it break cause I've been watching you fall apart for way too long
And it's no surprise I have thoughts that'll make you shake
I scare myself when I lose my sleep
I start to wander in the middle of the dead night

I've been holding out
I've been watching you again
I've been staring out
Don't call the cops on me babe (yet)

It's never gonna be the same, I know
It's never gonna be the same
You're never gonna be the same, I know
My only crime is that I cared
Is that I cared
Is that I cared
Is that I cared
I'm on a mission to find
I'm on a mission to find
I'm on a mission to find what I've been missing
I wish she wasn't concerned
I wish she wasn't but
I'm on a road to high
I'm on a road to high
I'm on a road to higher ground now
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me

Always on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
Can't you see a pattern taking shape before your eyes
Always on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
Oh always on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
You and me need a little fun progress lost business won
What we need intelligence rest in peace sweet conscience
Vultures fly swoop down low catch prey pick your bones
We were not meant to live like this
We're always tired always sick

[Verse]
I only wanna make it through today
Is that so hard to ask?
Another life lesson learned, okay
It's hard to speak for this

[Chorus]
Ooh a lover born with no one and I could speak to you
You never told me what it means to be with
A lover born with no one and I can speak to you
You never told me what it means to be with you
You've got me all wrong
I never meant to do it baby, do it baby
'Cause you've got me all wrong
I'm aware, I'm aware

[Bridge]
It just rolls along I guess
Slow down, slow down
Slow down, down

[Chorus]
Ooh a lover born with no one and I could speak to you
You never told me what it means to be with
A lover born with no one and I can speak to you
You never told me what it means to be with you
You've got me all wrong
I never meant to do it baby, do it baby
'Cause you've got me all wrong
I'm aware, I'm aware
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down baby yes I said

Down down down the stream
I've seen consciousness break it's concentration on me
Nothing new this side of town
Heard you're missing me
Well that's news I thought that we were past that way way past that but

I let you down
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down baby yes I said

I'm a fool I'm the fool who gets out
Forgets the reason for leaving
I don't need nobody else so get out
I think it's time you start leaving
One more chance for you to leave this mess cause I know cause I know
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down baby yes I said

I let you down
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down baby yes I said

I let you down
I let you down
I let you down
I let you down baby yes I said

You tryna dance, I'm tryna peel
Get yo ass on these wheels, it ain't (?)

[Bridge: Reel & Lil Wayne]
She wouldn't say it if it wasn't true wasn't true

Another lie oh what am I to do I to do?

[Chorus]
Life is real
Life is really, really, real, yeah
I'm always ready for the bounce back

Everytime it hurts, never heal it
'Cause I got the strength
I keep building

And you know I'll always bounce back
Never turn back
Love is like that

[Verse 1]
Ladies, let me tell you something
We come too far to lose
We'll win this battle
We suffer hard for love

Look what we're made of, beautiful scars on us
This life is what we make it
Won't change a thing
Ain't worry 'bout it, no

All the suffering and fighting
But still, I pull through
Yeah
Still we rise and we fall everytime

[Verse]
You like late, late nights
Champagne life
Plastic friends hangin' at your party
Camera flash like the paparazzi
Posted up, watch the lights get started
Fake love kills, bright green bills
Throw 'em up, make it rain, so boring
Tryna tell me the same old story
Sick and tired of the same old story

[Pre-Chorus]
Living your life in a picture
Photoshop, put it online
Chandeliers swing in the kitchen
But you're out telling a lie

[Chorus]
You're generation braindead
And you think you're ridin' high, high
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh-woahh
Oh-ohh-woahh
Oh-ohh-woahh
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive

[Verse]
You like late, late nights
Champagne life
Plastic friends hangin' at your party
Camera flash like the paparazzi
Posted up, watch the lights get started
Fake love kills, bright green bills
Throw 'em up, make it rain, so boring
Tryna tell me the same old story
Sick and tired of the same old story

[Pre-Chorus]
Living your life in a picture
Photoshop, put it online
Chandeliers swing in the kitchen
But you're out telling a lie

[Chorus]
You're generation braindead
And you think you're ridin' high, high
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive
Oh-ohh

Oh-ohh-woahh
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive

[Bridge]
You like perfect boys, perfect girls
Fake it till you make it in the perfect world
Now tip the axis and do a twirl
Now, rip your dress up and dance on the table
Still, the glass cracks
Like the mirror on your bathroom wall
Imagine if you lost it all, yeah
Did you think about the rise and fall?
Are you in it till the curtain call? Ahh

[Chorus]
You're generation braindead
And you think you're ridin' high, high
Generation braindead, yeah, you're living but you're not alive

[Outro]
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh-woahh

[Intro]
Yeah, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, oh-oh
Hurry up and bounce it before I forget what I made in my head
Yeah

[Verse]
I don't wanna spend my life thinking what they'll think or what they might
If I go see her show, she might collapse and lose her life
I guess I'll save some money and save myself from wasting time, like
Fuck this lil' dyke, the way she's going, it'll be her fault if she ever dies
All that time you was talkin', that shit was eatin' me alive
Through the judgments, you didn't see I was fightin' for my life
How could I send signs? And God forgive me if I cry
Then I'll become an attention seeker and not a leader
See, people will only really understand you when they need you
I guess I'm better off all alone in a two-seater
People tellin' me to stop, "Don't be a weak human being"
While the voice inside my head keeps tellin' me that I need it
I now ask you, please stop judgin' me
I got myself out this single-handedly
And we do what we do 'cause we don't understand the consequence
Of every step we take is wrong, how could we ever see the mess?
(Ooh)
And it's not just you and me, the whole youth is depressed
Living with the devil, constant battle every day
Wake up, gotta talk to people but I don't know what to say
And they tellin' me get off my ass, I was born on the wrong path
(Yeah, mm)
And I'm tryna solve these problems, but I was always bad at math
(Mm, yeah)
And your voice has made it harder, and that's just honestly
I had to shoot up to my brain to become the person that I wanna be (Yeah, oh)
Growin' up tryin' to figure out who you are
Sniffin' shit at fourteen, it becomes a lil' hard
When you're livin' in a scene where the healthy shit is far
But the drugs are no further than your room or your car
Don't be alarmed, it'll get brighter, it'll get better
It's 'cause we are fighters and tougher than leather
The strong you is inside, but you just haven't met her
Only we control our storm because we are the weather
Don't get how I could love the things that really torn me
Remember tellin' myself that I was quittin' in the mornin'
And did you really tryna help or was you tryna tell a story?
It's okay 'cause I got me and I don't need you to feel sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
The future's bright, let's make it plural
We got us, we are the light
We are the world, we are love
We gotta fight for ourselves 'cause no one's gonna, no one's gonna, yeah

[Chorus]
I laugh when I'm with friends
But I'm sad when I'm alone
And I be alone, and I be alone
And I be alone, yeah
And I be alone, yeah
And I be alone, yeah
And I be alone, yeah, ooh
I laugh when I'm with friends
But I'm sad when I'm alone
And I be alone, yeah, I be alone (Yeah)
Oh, I laugh when I'm with friends
But I'm sad when I'm alone
And I be alone

[Intro]
Let's go in
Another day
My Nigga Gucci Mane, DJ Mars
It's the kid!
Bobby Black, the ruler!
Chicken Talk Part 2
(Down and Dirty)
Gucci Mane Montana from east Atlanta
Let's take it to the east-side Atlanta
So Icey Entertainment
Another night another check, Gucci

[Hook]
Yawwwwn, It's boring
There's no comp; wake me up, I'm snoring (Yawwwwn)
Six rings on, you can call me Robert Horry
Still busting bricks down, Zone Six quarry
Whipping up a brick, yeah I'm working with the fork-y
Iced-out dog, same size as a Yorkie
Whipping up a brick, yeah I'm working with the fork-y
Iced-out dog, same size as a Yorkie

[Verse 1]
Coke game breezy, but the rap game's easy
If I'm not trapping, God stop my breathing
Somebody girl getting fucked this evening
Six rings on and my iced-out Breitling
Grill look right today, chest look right today
Air 15's so we're not fighting it
Brand new Porsche-y, working my fork-y
White and black chain, same color your Jordans
So Icey boys, we get high like Martians
Probably can't pull 'em, but I bet my car can
Tall, rich black man
Nineteen stacks, man
Add two tax, man
Twenty one racks, man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I hopped out the truck, rolled up cause I'm iced-out
Money blewed up, save scratch like a tour bus
Hoes adore us, they show for us
We sho' nuff tough
I'm so kushed up
I'm so iced up, damn I'm freezing
Red diamonds on me, so my chest just bleeding
Tats everywhere, baby boo -- I'm sleeving
With one gat, one shot, one reason
Gucci change cars every time it change seasons
I think I'm getting the bird flu, damn I'm sneezing (Ha-choo)
Ha-choo, Gesundheit, I'm cheesing
My jewelry real pretty like my little niece is

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Iced-out hard, man, red diamonds gorgeous
The bezel on my watch got me thinking I'm important
Shorty hating on us cause he know he can't afford it
Rings and chains and Zaytoven recording
'74 restored, rolling down Moreland
Headed up Custer, I'm finna pick juice up
Yeah, you heard the old shit; this the new shit
Still in the Libra doing the same old two-step
Gucci frames, Gucci belt, rappers need Gucci help
Hopping out my gut, looking oh so debonair
Ten stacks, twenty stacks, sell em by the twenty pack
Gucci took the rap game from me, he won't give it back
It's Gucci!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's your bad girl, underneath that sweet smile
Like a peek of black lace that nobody but me sees
Just a trace of all the possibilities
Maybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quart of wine
That we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it
Everything you're doing, girl is my weakness

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Oh-oh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Verse 2]
You know what you're doin' girl
You know what it does to me
When you turn on that song, and turn the lights down
Baby I'm gone, before the part about you
Dancin' in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Oh-oh girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Bridge]
Can't tell you no
Can't say goodbye
Can't hold a little bit back even if I tried
'Cause when I look in your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

[Verse 1]
I saw you throw your hands in the air and say a prayer
Your eyes closed, your nose breathing in the salty air
There was nothing you could do to make me love you anymore
You said, "What I despair in you
I don't feel like I'm going anywhere with you
I might as well fling myself into your ocean
At least then I'll would be with you"

[Chorus]
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled

[Verse 2]
So you jumped down from the cliff you'd climbed to
Into paradise that lay below you
I could only stare
And let my tears fall in the ocean

[Chorus]
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled

And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled
And the ocean roared
And the ocean howled

[Verse 1]
The moon was full and it left me howling
My head was spinning and my heart was growling
I received crimson stains on my sheets that morning
The world felt big and the tides were moving
Moving

[Chorus]
And I stopped caring too much about my outside
I stopped caring too much about my outside
Didn't wanna be told (Didn't wanna be told) what I'm supposed to look like
Didn't wanna be told what makes a woman look right
Didn't wanna be told, didn't wanna be told
Right
Didn't wanna be told, didn't wanna be told

[Verse 2]
So I took off my clothes
And I jumped right in
The 3 AM water
It soaked my skin
The full moon tide was up to my chin
I looked at you and your mischief grin
I looked at you and your mischief grin
I looked at you and your mischief grin

[Bridge]
You better cut off your wings cause you're held up by strings now
Cut off your wings 'cause you're held up by strings now

[Chorus]
And I stopped caring too much about my outside
I stopped caring too much about my outside
Didn't wanna be told (Didn't wanna be told) what I'm supposed to look like
Didn't wanna be told what makes a woman look right
Didn't wanna be told, didn't wanna be told
Right
Didn't wanna be told, didn't wanna be told
Am I out of my mind for feeling some kind of bliss to kiss of the highway?
Sure, it's no Milky Way and I'm a little lost in LA
But I'll just listen to the cars that are going real fast
I don't have it all figured out baby, but don't you try to stop me
I don't mind pissing in the wind—oh, be my only friend
I think I feel another moon rising, whatever the fuck that means
Don't think I quite believe in anything, what does that make me?
In the cluster fuck of broken breaking, trying, living, earning, winning
You won't make it, my son, if you don't learn to run on tightropes, laugh at bad jokes
You gotta be something, you gotta be someone
You gotta be something, you gotta be someone
What does that mean and could I rather be nobody?
What does that mean and could I rather be nobody?
Taking turns to
Draw a circle in the sand
Your hand quivers
And I shiver

On days you'd sail away
I would try to find my own way
On days you'd sail away
I would try to find my own way home

Oh the loss of you, the loss of you
Will haunt me through and through
Oh the loss of you, the loss of you
Will haunt me through and through

Drifting driveby
Shoot at anything that moves
Slowly sinking
Ship nobody can rescue

On days you'd sail away
I would try to find my own way
On days you'd sail away
I would try to find my own way home
Oh I've been waiting for you, waiting for you
To tell me where to go from here
I've been waiting for you, waiting for you
To tell me where to go from here

[Verse 1]
You're a tiger, walking through worlds
Of burning fire
But they put you in a zoo
In your dreams you were flying through the trees
But when you woke up
You were behind a lock and key

[Verse 2]
So you looked up into the faces of the people staring at you
You said, what the fuck are you looking at? I'm a tiger
This is no place for my fire, you're a liar
If you think you care about me

[Verse 3]
So you went to dreamland
More and more often 'cause in dreamland
You were the king of the jungle
But in that fucking cage
You were angered and afraid
That you'd never ever see the day that you could run away

[Chorus 1]
You said, who the fuck are you to put me in a zoo?
I'm a tiger with the fire and I'll bite you in your face
Who the fuck are you to put me in a zoo?
I'm a tiger with the fire and I'll bite you in your face

[Verse 4]
You're a dolphin, queen of the ocean
Mind of mystery, a soul that is free
Then one day while you were at play they took you
And put you far far away

[Verse 5]
Where they train you
For people's entertainment
And you say, I hope you are entertained by my containment
In your dreams you are flying through the sea
But when you woke up
You were behind a lock and key

[Chorus 2]
You say, why am I here listening to you cheers?
I'm a dolphin from the ocean
And that's where I'm meant to be
Why am I here listening to your cheers?
I'm a dolphin from the ocean
You should be entertaining me

[Verse 1]
Bent out boy in the car down the pavement
Turn here that's your place
Glitter girl in the back of the basement
Opened window frame

[Chorus]
Heather, wanna see you soon
If you do
Heather, when I'm in your room
"Love Me Do"

[Verse 2]
Empty lot has a guest close to midnight
Spilling out its sides
Something of going on in the streetlight
Mother sleeps just fine

[Chorus]
Heather, wanna see you soon
If you do
Heather, when I'm in your room
"Love Me Do"

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes]
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Double cupped up, jeans with the cuts
Bottom double cuffed up
Lookin' for a model who I can cuff up
I wonder if those Bronx bitches let me holler
A bunch of strippers or beauticians from the beauty parlor
A couple scammers boostin' Prada, Dolce and Gabbana
I'm finna squad up, hit the mob, and call up all my partners
I die my young bull, it was Young Lord, seven knocker
I might head to hoop, rather party next to Yonkers
Real money cool with all the hoes, G shit, be shit
Crip niggas came with these snips
I go, detour, snuck the heat in
It was ladies' nights uptown on the weekend
So they drink for free
Think of G when you think of me
Niggas play pimpin', I ain't into make believe
Syrup sippin' way before the make believe
Bitches in the place to be
I wonder where to take to make 'em shake for me
I'm a motherfuckin' G
A-dollar sign, A-dollar-A-P, uh
Hunnid gold teeth and a hunnid gold teeth
I was young, and I was hung
And I was runnin' in the streets, that's G
Meet my motherfuckin' peeps
Wake up in the morning, brush my fuckin' teeth, go freeze
Before the other niggas throw sleeves
Nigga run the streets we don't run from police
That's G

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes]
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride

[Verse 1]
I've never seen you before
You're gonna walk out explain a little more
I wish that there'd be no end (no end)
You're hard to train but it all depends

[Verse 2]
You make me say it again
I don't belong
Yeah you make me say it
I am done waiting
Wait what are you doing
Tell me your secrets
I will not hold them against you
Didn't they raise you
Better than this
Oh shit is it over?
U missed The point again
Depending on your friends
Trying To make sense
Why are you angry
I thought you had me
Oh but
Nothing's as it seems
I swear picture it in
Time to break the spell
Oh hell
Witches calling


Now that you're older i think you should try it
I know that you feel you are so good at hiding
I'm here to warn you it's time to grow up
And if you don't evolve you're bound to erupt
You mentioned to me you wanna be someplace where things don't grow

Make something special the timing is clear it won't last forever cause nothing is real
Nothing to feel I don't want to change
Keep it the same

Go forth my child into the daylight
Nothings as it seems
Not anymore
She don't believe me ever when I say
Life's indifferent and it's a ok
She don't believe me ever when I say

We're different and it's all ok

Uh-uhh we are, we are
We are, we are
We are, we are
Uh-uhh we are, we are
We are, we are
We are, we are

She don't believe me ever when I say
Life's indifferent and it's a ok
She don't believe me ever when I say
We're different and it's all ok
Why won't she listen to me when I say
Life's indifferent and it's a ok
Why won't she listen to me when I say
We're different and it's all ok
She don't believe me ever when I say
Life's indifferent and it's a ok
She don't believe me ever when I say
We're different and it's all ok

Uh-uhh we are, we are
We are, we are
We are, we are
Uh-uhh we are, we are
We are, we are
We are, we are
Uh-uhh we are, we are
We are, we are

Now I rock water like I'm Michael Phelps, yeah
Black diamonds, Black History Month
Turned to Martin Luther King overnight

[Verse 3: Trouble]
It wasn't like you had my back, no (No)
Homie, you not have a whole spine
Didn't ever wanna admit to the fact
That your baby boy was contemplatin' dyin' (For real, for real)
In the dream, yeah, I done seen you cryin' (Yeah)
Dream don't compare to what I done seen (Yeah)
They tried to kill me for nothin' (Lived though)
Tell her yeah she got it bussin' (Brrt)
Think about everybody else
I think once to myself, I think once to myself (Not one time)
Only blamma to the left (Damn)
I'm up in the booth by myself
Never came for the fame, no (No)
I'm the same nigga, the same goals (Same one)
Niggas hatin' for these lame hoes (Lame hoes)
Put that pussy on me, she been tamed though (Pussy)

[Verse 4: Shad da God]
Actavis got me dreamin', Martin Luther, huh (What you saw?)
Rolls-Royces and diamonds, they wet like coochie (They lucky, wow)
Boo right here sittin' with a K full of kick like Bruce Lee
And I, ah, ah, jewelry, yeah, I got a line on that jewelry
Bitch on that, ayy, ayy, Malcolm X, tryna shoot me (Shoot, shoot)
Screamin' that, uh, got babies up in that dually cruiser (Woo)
You juugin', you blessed, at your scene, blew bankroll like usual (Bankroll)
They chasin' the belt, I'm goin' so fast it look like they're in neutral (Skrrt)
I was havin' some lean (Drank)
She wanna play with that Charlie Sheen (Woo)
Put that bitch on a bean (Hol' up)
She steady dreamin' 'bout lots of tings, she want lots of tings
Yeah, I'm smokin' a bag and killed that cat like curiosity
All night I buy some rings and swear by me
Cut

[Verse 1]
Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
We're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

[Pre-Drop]
Ah ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah, ah-ah-ah
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Drop]
G-g-g-g-ghost
G-g-g-g-ghost

[Bridge]
We're gonna stay here

[Pre-Drop]
Ah ah, ah-ah-ah

Ah ah, ah-ah-ah
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Drop]
G-g-g-g-ghost
G-g-g-g-ghost

[Verse 1]
One thing left to try
See if you can make it
Before you choose the night
And the silence overtakes you
If you looked into the fire
And you had that conversation
Then there's one thing left to try
If you want to save your life

[Refrain 1]
Fear is his name, but his friends still call him God
Again and again, the thought remains

(The only way to get rid of the feeling)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna die
Wishing I'd done something
More than what's required
To last until the sunset
No, I don't wanna die
Thinking that I'm dreaming
There's one thing left to try
If you want to change your life

[Refrain 2]
Today I left those thoughts behind, behind
Over and over, you die just to feel alive

[Bridge]
The only way to get rid of the feeling
You have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing
Decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)

[Outro]
(There's one thing left to try)
(There's one thing left to try)

[Intro]
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

[Verse]
Here we go round on the boulevard
Top cutting the cake till the sugar flow, stop, don't stop (it's a record)
Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help me stop, can't stop (it's a record)

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

[Verse]
Wire that girl for the electronic
Underground scene where the beat is chronic, yeah
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique), oh yeah
Drip drip drip, baby watch me melt
Take a sip sip sip, but it doesn't help, it's bad, so bad (it's a record)

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique
We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique

[Bridge]
We gotta synthetic situation
And we dance with no intermission
Mister shouldn't have kissed her
Before the rock show was o-o-over
Here we go-go, sir
We're making time, it's a record, record, record

[Chorus]
Don't tell me you love me
In the middle of the summer
Don't say that you need me
In the middle of the summer
Don't tell me you love me when it's tragic
And my heart's in the blender
Yeah baby we're plastic
And we'll melt in the summer, melt in the summer

Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Melt in the summer
(We are plastic, oh, nous sommes plastique)
Michael is you, he has your face
He still has your eyes, remember
Peter is me, 'cept when he smiles
And if you look at them both for a while
You can see they are you, they are me

This spring we had some heavy rain
By summer it was dry again
The roses that we planted last fall
Climbed the wall

I think the house could use some paint
You know your mother's such a saint
She takes the boys whenever she can
She sure needs a man

All those years I've worked for Santa Fe
Never ever missed a single day
Just one more without a raise in pay
And I'm leaving
And the air still has a country smell
And everyone is looking well
As far as anyone can tell
The sun will rise tomorrow
You'll never believe how much they're growing

John Henry came to cut the lawn
Again he asked me where you'd gone
Can't tell you all the times he's been told
But he's so old

Guess that's all the news I've got today
Least that's all the news that I can say
Maybe soon the words will come my way, tomorrow

And the air still has a country smell
And everyone is looking well
Far as anyone can tell
The sun will rise tomorrow
You'll never believe how much they're growing
You'll never believe how much they're growing...
You always looked a little out of place
All grown up with freckles on your face
We'd spend each night with company
Just you the teddy bears the dolls and me
What a funny girl you used to be

You always had a thousand things to do
Getting all involved with something new
Always some new recipe
The kitchen always looked like world war three
What a funny girl you used to be

It was so good with you around
You always found a smile
Where smiles could not be found

I never ever met a person more sincere
You'd always listen
With an open ear

You'd fall for lines so easily
Whatever they were selling
You'd buy three
What a funny girl you used to be
What a funny girl you used to be

You know something that I wouldn't care for
Lights keep flashing on the other side

Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you

To be true, I must confess
Making coffee I'm a mess
Don't know anything about football
Been unfaithful once or twice
Cannot even win at dice
As for watches, I don't use one
To be completely honest
No one thinks of you
Quite the way I do
It's all the same to you now

To be true I must confess
I never sleep at twelve or less
Never take a bath on Sundays
Since I'm telling you so much
I cry in earnest once a month
When the weather turns to freezing
With me nothing is easy
Only you can tell
You know me so well
Without you everything's a bore

[Chorus]
The sky is seeing a million raindrops fall
The hours seem to crawl
And every day that passes is just the same
Just like yesterday
I can't find anyway to forget you because
To keep on loving you
Is inevitable

I always felt that it was true
When we talk of me and you
I should be the first revealing
Sure you know what's going on
Nothing's better since you're gone
At the very least I'm breathing
And you won't be returning
Nothing left to tell
I know you so well
What will I ever do without you?

[Chorus]
The sky is seeing a million raindrops fall
The hours seem to crawl
And every day that passes is just the same
Just like yesterday
I can't find anyway to forget you because
To keep on loving you
Is inevitable

[Outro]
I always felt that it was true
When we talk of me and you
I should be the first revealing

[Verse 1]
What you 'gon do when you can't fight
Anymore for the limelight?
What you 'gon do?
When they lo-lo-love you?
What you''gon do when you can't sleep
Anymore and you can't breathe?
What you 'gon do?
When they judgin, judgin' rules

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way we can be stopped
We're takin' our best shot
Honey, cuz we got a better plan
There's no way we can be topped
We're comin' for your spot
Honey, cuz we got a better man

[Chorus]
C'mon!
On the runway, dressed in his best
C'mon, fashion!
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
C'mon!
On the runway, dressed in his best
C'mon, fashion!
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no way we can be stopped
We're takin' our best shot
Honey, cuz we got a better plan
There's no way we can be topped
We're comin' for your spot
Honey, cuz we got a better man

[Chorus]
C'mon!
On the runway, dressed in his best
C'mon, fashion!
On the runway, work it, Black Jesus
C'mon!

Had to let my chick drive ‘cause that bitch real bad
First I let her drive it, then I let her ride me
I charged a nigga $40,000 just to stand beside me
(Yeahhhh) Now that’s a stupid check
Gave 40 to Tity Boi and now I got that stupid pack
On I-20 wit duffle bags, yeah, I shock a bitch (Chaka)
Two million dollars cash money, damn, man, that’s ludicrous
I love to ball wit bougie broads, it’s big Gucci, yeah I’m a dog
A photoshoot off in the vocal booth, ‘nough ice for all of y’all
Ten bricks outta fishscale, same color as Paul Wall
Took off all the burglar bars, you know what we doin’, dawg

[Hook: Gucci Mane & (Chubbie Baby)]
Every day I’m stunting dawg, money ain’t really nothin’ dawg
Ya boyfriend riding the bus so you need to ride with us, aww
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)
I can’t leave that trap alone, he can’t leave that trap alone
We can’t leave that trap alone, never gon’ leave that trap alone
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)

[Verse 2: Chubbie Baby]
Apple-red coupe, Jolly Rancher rims
63 on the vent, that’s a super-charged Benz
With the Big Apple plate and yeah he cost me some ends
New chopper in the trunk that’ll chop down ya friends
And my Boost phone jump soon I touch in Columbus
Man, that pearly white on deck, the Northside do numbers
True Religions on my ass, wrist on froze
Me and Gucci hit Velvet and pop thirty Ropes
If you short six grand, man, you getting 30 o’s
When I re-up, man, it look like I did thirty shows
In the morning count us doling while you niggas throwing ‘bows
And the coupe on autopilot, you see how it floats?

[Hook: Gucci Mane & (Chubbie Baby)]
Every day I’m stunting dawg, money ain’t really nothin’ dawg
Ya boyfriend riding the bus so you need to ride with us, aww
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)
I can’t leave that trap alone, he can’t leave that trap alone
We can’t leave that trap alone, never gon’ leave that trap alone
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I got that Pyrex vision, all we talk is chickens
I love my stove so much I got a bed in my kitchen
A fine red girl give me head in the kitchen
If a nigga try to rob me, he’ll be dead in the kitchen
I’m stunting with my shirt off, my girl like Smirnoff
We get that dough for cheap-cheap, my nigga that’s bird talk
Then I pull that ‘vert out, I’m wit my girlfriend too
Rims so tall it make my car look like it’s 6’2”
Smoking on a Vic too, louder than my trunk is
I’m wit Gucci Mane, I let Gucci do the ad-libs
Getting to that bread, that check, that mula
We teach you niggas how to stunt, we tutor the juniors

[Hook: Gucci Mane & (Chubbie Baby)]
Every day I’m stunting dawg, money ain’t really nothin’ dawg
Ya boyfriend riding the bus so you need to ride with us, aww
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)
I can’t leave that trap alone, he can’t leave that trap alone
We can’t leave that trap alone, never gon’ leave that trap alone
(We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero
We get that mula, that bread, that guap, dinero)

In the summer of 2016, my band and I played 66 shows, and in a vain attempt to impress my bandmates, I performed a new poem each night. I would write the poem either immediately after the show before or right before we went on stage or sometimes on the stage itself. These are just as few of those poems collected, intuitively, kind of at random, and I hope you enjoy them. This is i was born in detroit on a very very very very very very very cold day.

[Verse 1]
Do you think she's scared
I don't really know
I don't think she wants
To see me anymore
Look her in the eye
Baby, hold her hand
Do you think she knows
Do you think she understands

[Verse 2]
Do you think she's scared
I don't really know
I don't think she wants
To see me anymore
Look her in the eye
Baby, hold her hand
Do you think she knows
Do you think she understands

[Verse 3]
Sticky on my hand
Sour in my mouth
Now I know you better
I'll spit it on the ground

[Verse 4]
Sticky on my hand
Sour in my mouth

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine
On the up and up this life
'Til we're down on our luck
It makes no difference in this life
Up and ups just fine (Oh, you scared?)
On the up and up this life
'Til the lift gets stuck (You scared of?)
Lifting up, lifting up
Lifting up
Coming down, coming down
Coming down (I don't mind)
Make 'em look, make 'em look
To the sound

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
We were going home
Waiting for the kids
School bus to arrive
Oh, but you know, they're gonna do it anyway
Reaching for your keys
Wait, is that your phone?
Got a TBI
Wait, is that police?
Get out for what?
I'm not your guy
(But you know, they're gonna do it anyway)
Wife behind the trees
Tryna to tell you don't
They're about to fire
(They're gonna do it anyway)

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
They're gonna do it anyway

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
They are gonna do it anyway

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it
Don't do it, don't don't do it

[Verse 1: SZA and The Tracks]
You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane
You can't judge a woman by looking at her man
You can't judge one by looking at the other
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

[Chorus: William Prince, Victoria Canal, The Tracks]
Can't you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
Oh, you can't judge a book by looking at the cover, No

[Verse 2: Radkey, William Prince, Victoria Canal, The Tracks]
You can't judge a fish by looking in the pond
You can't judge right by looking at the wrong
You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother
No puedes 

[?]

[Chorus: Radkey]
Oh can't you see, yeah
You misjudge me
Look like a farmer
I'm a lover

[Guitar Solo: Noe Socha]

[Post-Chorus: William Prince and Ruby Ibarra]
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover (yeah)
Oh now (yeah)

[Bridge: Ruby Ibarra and SZA]
Write my stories now
Paint the cover now
My feet are runnin' but my soul's planted on the ground
Break the labels down
Make 'em hear my sound
Can't judge a book by its cover
Can you hear me now?
We wanna break free (Can't you see?)
No you can't paint me (You've been done to me)
I fell like eight feet
Be thinkin' I'm crazy
But listen, lately
I'm choosin' to be all the things they make me
They try to judge me and they try to read me (Can't you see?)
Put me in box
Break the locks, never stop (You've been done to me)

[? 1:50] at the docks
Off the top, flip a hot
Takin' one look, try to read me like a book
But I leave 'em all shook
'Cause you can't judge a book by its cover

[Outro: SZA]
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
You can't judge a book by looking at the cover

[Intro]
Loot doot doot doot doot doot

[Verse 1]
It's like I got my brain in a grip, you know
Me Vs. Me: the most dangerous shit
My whole attitude stink and I ain't changing my shit
You can't blame me for being crazy 'cause I came from this shit
Take what I get so I ain't thankful for shit
And this ain't never been about no fucking chain and a whip
I'm aiming for which target turn my pain into bliss
Keep hunting till I lay in the ditch
Swear this game is a bitch

[Chorus]
I've been worrying about the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often
Seem like I been worried 'bout the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often

[Verse 2]
I'm the under-celebrated greatest, saver the latest
The reason that you sayin' graces: me
Business is usual ain't no game to play with
Swing for the fences, I'm covering all the bases A to: Z
Full totality what you thinking don't rattle me, I'm so tranquil
I'm locked in like I'm Kurt Angle on your ankle
The frame of mind that I seem to stay inside need a appraisal
Getting high, as long as my heart-rate is stable
Watch me yanking out the cable
Fuck a pawn in the game
Run the credit up a hundred put it all on my name
Charge hard like an all-star, it's all in the game
All in my brain, I know it's hard but I hardly get change
I'm too stubborn

[Chorus]
I've been worrying about the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often
Seem like I been worried 'bout the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often

[Verse 3]
And I got no reasons for this mood that I'm in
How they design their fucking silence
It's either get rich or die while you trying
Trying my best to shake these bad habits
I swear that I'm vying
I swear that I'm calm
But fuck with my time and I swear that's violence
So familiar with the feeling get it way too often
Ain't complacent with the safety I be way too cautious
Watch me flourish even when the picture ain't too gorgeous
You lil' niggas couldn't paint these portraits
I'm Bob Ross with it
Walking tall on these promises till all get it
Big dogs stompin' like Clifford while you get lost in it
Nigga my heart's in it
So it's easy to tell that you aren't authentic

[Chorus]
I've been worrying about the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often
Seem like I been worried 'bout the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often

[Outro]
Wait hold on one second let me text my-
Uh, this nigga back

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
If you don't want me then don't speak like Fantasia
Peanuts doll awake me that Jamaican coloured Bapestas
Me and all my dogs flirting with that euthanasia
Some niggas caught the wave and some niggas caught cases
But you know the game
Hardly ever in control even though you playin'
Couple options got on hold but just know I'm weighing
And you ain't livin' out your songs, you're just known for sayin'
Feed my marijuana jones and then I'm in my zone again
They ain't tryna see me back on my old shit
Durag 2x tall tee up over that phone clip
That 24 gram watch me bust down the zone shit
Run the play back to back on some watching the throne shit
Don't let me catch you 'less you know me
Niggas are down, you bad and turn they back and be your homie
I ain't got a blunt of weed or even matches for a phoney
Make me laugh like saying Shaq carried Kobe
Y'all just some funny niggas

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Yeah
You niggas is hilarious
Modern day embarrassments
My blackness is synonymous
With Odells, Marcels, Mabels and Clarences
Black ass names filled with black ass arrogance
The good doctor Tigallo, called me a emeritus, called me a reverend
With the essence of Leo in The Revenant
But called me a brethren
Or you could just call me "that nigga"
What could be more American?
This ain't no shit for the ascots
This is for the galaxies and planets of Asgard
Black mirror effect, at my own neck with a glass shard
I'm ready to set it, I'm Kim Jong in a rap squad
Looking at the switch like: mask on, fuck it, mask off
Either learn the game or you will end up a mascot
When Te's in the building just prepare for the onslaught
It's gonna be a good night
Tell you niggas, bon soir
Tigallo

[Outro]
Get in line motherfucker
Ready to die motherfucker
It's yours truly, ha, Mr.HowTheFuckIsYouGonnaTellMe
Plus I came with 99 motherfuckers
Like it's 1999 motherfucker
Get high motherfucker
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha
Uh, Put lotion on them ashy ass socks
Before you step out your crib
Niggas ain't never put no lotion on they socks
You don't know 'bout the struggle then
Put some lotion on some ashy socks them shits come right back to life
Y'all niggas don't know the struggle man
Bring your little ass in the house man
See the streetlights is on, it's cold as hell out here
Fuck is wrong with you?

[?]

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Oh there it go, Uh

[Verse]
Son of a gun out the holster, cops was a rolling stone
Covers shoot the shooter, left some chips on my shoulder
But I'm the master with those tricks so in my whip I'm a chauffeur
It's like windows crack in this bitch, rollin' dossier
I'm on a mission like
Let me slow down and get this picture right
Slide through the city, cold as christmas night
My OG had that winter white
Had the fees itching like they picking at an insect bite
I would just chill up in that bitch and write
First time I smoked I was too humble for more
I was 16 seeing a quarter mill dumped on the floor
They let me see it
But they urged me not to come through the door
We stay away from this game and this fucking allure, I was a boy
Free cricket till they let him out his cage, that's my nigga
Smoking blunts till the day, I hope his time come quicker
You know I stayed away from the game
But I found another way to get payed off this pain I would scribble
Got my eyes on the money but my mind above all
Keep those snakes out the circle, ain't no liars involved
Still, Wether whatever bet I'm still refining my flaws
Sometimes pressure don't make diamonds at all
A lot of niggas don't even care to live righteous at all
I see through niggas, me and then don't share no likeness at all
Diffrent strokes still a product of that hustle
It's just a different approach
Roll steady through that fire when niggas is getting 

[inhale, exhale]
But still I rise to put that smoke in the sky
Make me feel alive, locking up that bag securities
Same feelin' I had ridin' in that winter ride
So I don't question if it's real or not
Already know not to get caught in the lore
Games over, being caught out in the storms
It's just the law

[Outro]
Yeah

[Intro]
Holla at ya boy

[Verse 1]
My swag ugly like Lonzo Ball's shoe
But it's all looks and niggas alls up

[?] when I fall through
I'm a dog like Charlie Zelenoff
I'm looking for a spar, unite it all
Watch me stuff your memoirs inside a cigar
I'm getting blazed in your memory
Crush these weak niggas like: ha, sheesh, give me energy
My whole fleet moving with mystique, that's that synergy
Lame niggas talking like they made in the spot light looking finicky
Y'all bore, I'm more American Horror Story
You bore my words like paranoia to a porch warrior boy
Not in my category
Running that weak fade like Joe Torre
I'm in the clutch where niggas worry, shit I'm Robert Horry
And this some weather vet shit
Protect your neck and get your chest split for your necklace, young and reckless

[Interlude]
Ayy, ayy
Get that chest split for that necklace, young and reckless

[Verse 2]
I don't know where I come from with all this shit I be thinking
But you not seeing me, you motherfuckers keep dreaming
My heart froze solid like I'm some kind of anemic
Stick my fingers down a trap like I'm some kind of bulimic
Swear my fingers stay itchy, I don't need no glove
And if ain't about the money nigga we won't budge
Still from the mud, I'm from the scummy, I don't need no love
All my family can't stand if you don't bleed no blood

[Interlude 2]
I was hitting it like huh...

[Intro]
1,2
I hope I got a 16 for this
I hope I got a-, aye
Shut the fuck up, aye

[Verse 1]
Man, you niggas ain't get no peace until my niggas get they pieces up
For these reasons they tell me to keep dreaming
When honestly I don't even get the sleep enough
I keep my worries in the streets too much, I guess
I walk heavy hope the devil can handle these steps
Feelin' so blessed, I leave hell with a settlement check
Walking through fire with a shark face sweater on deck
Money can't pay for what you owe, you forever in debt nigga
No money can't pay for a day of respect nigga
And money can't change the view between you and the next nigga
If we viewin' in the grand scheme of things
Nigga we can't dream, we makin' shit moves like a dance team
Pardon 'cause I ain't with the band scene
This is one man song about that road that the man be in

[Interlude]
Yeah, this is one man song about the-

[Chorus]
Imma just sing me a song about sittin' all alone
And day dreamin' 'bout a million (a milli, a milli, a milli)
But dreaming ain't gon' take it alone 'cause if it's taking too long that's when it break a nigga's feelin's up, and
I ain't got to answer to shit but got these voices in my head that always sound so appealing, like
I can't promise you gon' make it to the morning, till the morning comes so we gon' have to try to make it real tonight
Whatchu feelin' like

[Verse 2]
What's niggas problems if they runnin' out of options
Minds only on the dollars
And they fumbling with they conscience
In a place of no control and hate feeling like they boxed in
Trouble what's ahead nigga be locked up or get locked in
Really what's the purpose?
Just trying not to be worthless
Do I deserve this?
I admit I used to be nervous
Moving with the current might get swallowed in this deep water
Thru the ups and downs and back again, I'm like a seesaw-er
Trying to cut the snakes and softer niggas trying to leech off us
Pat you on the back, the same niggas try to leap-frog it
That secret is a rap, won't catch another night of sleep off us
Quit thinking that a simple spark of weed could be a peace offering
I mean respect's a hard thing to acquire
And losing it is easy as walking with your feet on the wire
That's why I'm staying higher up just to keep me inspired
Let that one man sing, who trying to preach to the choir, uh

[Chorus]
Imma just sing me a song about sittin' all alone and daydreaming 'bout a million (a milli)
But dreaming ain't gonna take it alone 'cause if it's taking too long that's when it break a nigga's feelin's up, and
I ain't gotta answer to shit but got these voices in my head that always sound so appealing like
I can't promise you gon' make it to the morning, till the morning comes so we gon' have to try to make it real tonight
Whatchu feelin' like

[Intro]
Yeah, bitch
Can you turn the music up in the headphones?
Yeah

[Verse]
I heard living like this is wrong so I'm smoking to get it right
It's so ugly face only mothers could like
I hold my strong arm steady so why you come to this fight
Hope that strong arm steady like I'm scoping to snipe (Bam)
I'm sliding safe like it's stolen bases, I'm old and dangerous
I'm on a wait, got my(?) glory days on these open pages
The evil out my way is fading, let me burn my sages
The devil flirting but I curve him daily
I'm problematic, I make sure they hate me
Must be absurd and crazy
This how living dirty made me
Nothing from you herbs amaze me
Got in the game swore let these burdens change me
But I don't feel like the same person lately
Fuck being glossy, I don't keep that bullshit out my face
Pay attention even if my friends hissing
I push that bucket till it scrapes
Stay pressing to the metal, never let 'em catch a brake
If I don't get mines, I'm gon break shit
If it ain't pay time then I won't say shit
It ain't no break time, feeding 'em breakfast
If you try to knock my hustle, you gon'' end with a break wrist
So used to being told my niggas we ain't shit
Sharpshooter venom and I'm slow and I can't miss
Crabs in a bucket on your own if you can't grip
It's fuck everybody, then you speaking my language
What the fuck

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Too much co-sign gon' get you killed
Corporate politics among us but soon top Bill
Nothing safe then, tip-toe to save your reputation
Shit's weak but I admire admiration
And I know men reminds me find my pen
'Cause writing, killing, typing for designing with blends
I've been smoking like the smoke stacks poking out the ocean
Magic potion, wizard hat, cloak is open
Deliver that on the dot
Beginners wait for they dinner
But the winners are not, shit I been winning a lot
Rap circles, technical is definitely dead to me
Saying all these syllables and hearing nothing said to me
I used to get upset when the melody was stuck in my head
Repetition while I'm climbing in bed
I'm a danger to myself when I'm not at my best
So Ima get some rest, pass her off to brother Step

[Outro]
And now: back to your regularly scheduled programme
Ayo Domo bring your ass over here man
Kick some of that old bullshit you be talking about

[Verse 1]
Living by my limits baby not on these laws
I don't need much but damn I want it all
Got some issues that can never get resolved
They show me this image I knew I'd get involved
Like how much time in a day?
'Cause I ain't left college to smoke, Momma promise a way
Man to be honest ain't no options y'all got dollars to pay
And if it ain't about the big scrape: I'm not on my way
Take me out of this game, I need patience
I just need something tougher than hood famous
Something other than hood boogers
Tasting sugar is good ain't it
Another chip from these wood blocks ain't gettin' tanted
It's fucked up when they sleepin' on you're feelings
And the picture that you scripted way more vivid than these nigga's paintin'
A fucked feeling when you focused in on women
But you're shoe short just a jump shot from drug slagin'
Stay in your lane man, I know the pain
All you go through so they can know you're name
Hand you a rope to hang, and tell you jump
Now I'm just tryna stay afloat again
Shit I still remember way before the paper
Before I had a favour, 'fore it waved up
Was tying durags over my taper
It was: the preparation of this player
Catching these feelin's before I knew them shits was rare
I was just another nigga blowing kush up in the air
Rollin' dice and still aware that this crack game is unfair
So what's the point?
I guess it's for the thrill
My intentions wasn't dirty I was caught in the pill
I was writing 'bout this game, I dogde-balled it for real
I love that shit but way too smart to have my heart in the steal
Before me dreamin' even mattered, I was scheming so ellaborate
Couple place to feed right now, man I can't be no fucking rapper
Are you kidding me?
Them hopes were literally flat
I couldn't see it from my angle, man that picture was black
It's kodak
I seen so many niggas get it, where the fuck I go at?
It's pre-written you supposed to know that

[Verse 1]
Don't let him out again
From his hole in the ground
Yeah you promised not to make
Make a sound

[Verse 2]
Why would he try to feed
All your wants and needs
When he wants nothing for himself

[Verse 3]
Why would he try to bleed
Out his heart in your hand
When his blood is nothing more than sand

[Chorus]
When I go down to the hole in the ground
I know I've reached my end
When I go down to the hole in the ground
Then I can be your friend
When I go down to the hole in the ground
I know I've reached my end
When I go down to the hole in the ground
Then I can be your friend

[Verse 4]
Ten little Indians standing in a row
And they won't move a muscle until you say so
And I don't wanna be a part of that
And I don't wanna be a part of anything that you're a part of

[Verse 5]
You say it's a memory and I say its a dream
But we won't talk about it if you're gonna make a scene
And I don't wanna be around you now
And I don't wanna be around the part of me that I remember

[Verse 6]
Bloodiest the bloodiest the bloodiest was here
You're bloody when you leave me and you're bloody when you're near
But I don't think about it like I should
And I don't think I love it like I loved it when I use to love you

[Chorus]
When I go down to the hole in the ground
I know I've reached my end
When I go down to the hole in the ground
Then I can be your friend
When I go down to the hole in the ground
I know I've reached my end
When I go down to the hole in the ground
Then I can be your friend

[Verse 1]
I read my book today, I wonder if I'll get an A
I raised my hand today, I wonder if they'll know my name
I wandered back and forth, I wonder what my life is worth
I wandered back and forth, I think I'm on the second floor

[Chorus]
And I remember you, and I know what you can do
And I know you'd do it too if time would just let you

[Verse 2]
I am a rocker now, I am a rocker now and I'll do whatever the fuck I want
And I am a cannibal, I am a cannibal and I'll eat whatever the fuck I want

[Verse 3]
Are you okay, I'm not okay, In fact, I'm sick today
I saw a picture of my face, I looked like a disgrace
You don't know me, I'm on the floor but I'm just there to explore

[Chorus]
And I remember you, and I know what you've been through
And I know what you can do, and you know I'd do it for you

[Verse 1]
These Chinese melodies
I would never forget
Whatever it was you told me not to forget

[Verse 2]
Stumbling was a girl and she cried
Until they put her back in the sky
So let me know when they can take me up too

[Verse 3]
Simple was a man when he sang
That he would never love you again
But now that boy is back and he is coming on strong

[Verse 4]
I'm alone and afraid and I've got
Nobody else to blame
So don't blame me if I blame it on you

[Verse 5]
I heard the earth come alive late last night
And it looked me straight in the eye
And said
You'll be home soon

[Verse 1]
Uhh
I think you're like the autumn leaves
When you're all dried out and used up and withered
You'll fall on me

[Chorus]
Now I can't tell if you're lyin'
And I can't tell if you're cryin'
And I can't tell if you're flyin'
Or if you're just comin' down

[Verse 2]
Uhh
Why don't you just stick with me
You're all broke down and I'm awful bitter
So we're good company

[Chorus]
Now I can't tell if you're leavin'
And I can't tell if you're stayin'
And I can't tell if you're flyin'
Or if you're just comin' down

[Verse 1]
Sweet Marie, your beauty shines
You are the wonder in my eyes
I just wanna be the man
So choose me

[Verse 2]
I make you sway, I twirl you twice
I do the move that makes you smile
I just want to take your hand
And show you

[Chorus]
My love
This night is all for you
And we're not gonna waste it
My sweet Marie
You're the only one for me
It's fate and that's the way we want it

[Chorus]
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby

[Verse 1]
(Say..) hold up, baby keep it right there
Don't move that's my spot
That's all I wanna hear you say as I continue to get you hot
Baby slow down, speed it up
Girl, I wanna fill you up
Oohh, there ain't no limit to what I can do once I'm up in it
And I put that on my Adidas
I'm all of everything you ever needed (word)
I can tell your body's craving, girl, and I just wanna feed it
See I

[Chorus]
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby (said I, I)
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby

[Verse 2]
You see every one of your desires (oohh, oooohhhh)
I'm gonna make it happen, girl, just get on top and enjoy the ride
'Cause, I'm about to set that ass on fire
So let the iPod play
And let me give you all of me, fulfill your fantasies
I'm just trying to knock you up, so you can have your mini me

[Chorus]
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby
(Wanna make a baby, yeah)
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby

[Verse 3]
I'm talking two thumbs up, every time we make love
So girl let's make it happen (come on)
'Cause it's been long enough, yeah
So baby if you up to it
Let's skip the bullshit, take this thing off right now
'Cause I love you, oohh (I love), I wanna marry you, oohh
A generation, population, just tell 'em that it's human nature
Four, five kids
Let's do this, I wanna make a baby right now

[Chorus]
I wanna make a baby with you
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby (see, I)
I wanna make a baby with you (baby, girl)
Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby
(Do you wanna make, wanna make)

Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby
(Do you wanna, make a baby, yeeeeaaahhh)

Wanna make a baby, girl, do you wanna make a baby (turn over)

[Chorus]
Come at the same time (ooohhhhhh)
Come at the same time (oh ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby, we'll)
Come at the same time (baby ohh oh girl)
Come at the same time (shawty.. shawty, shawty.. shawty, baby)

[Verse 1]
You lie at the head, I lie at the foot
Now if you ask me, I think that that's a good look
I'm on top of you, making you feel it
And look up in the mirror, and see that ass in the ceiling
We'll be curling our toes, while screaming goddammit
Girl just let me know that my access is granted
I kiss on your neck and move on up to your ear (hey)
Girl, ain't nothing greater than us lying right here
(I really love the way we smooching)
Smooching is something that I do to get started and get you open
(And I love the way you tease me)
Oh, I like the way you do that

We're the perfect match yeah, sex at it's best
You're my pussycat yeah, and I'm your hot mess

Now I'm about to hit it like a honeymoon night
So girl grab the sheets and bite the pillow tight
(You's about to get it)

Girl I'ma jump on it, after that I'm gonna own it

[Outro]
Umm, yeah, I gotta go y'all
But before I go
There's one thing I wanna know
Turn the radios off, listen
(Are you coming?) Ohh, I gotta know pretty baby, yeah
(So I can meet you there)
Please fade this song before somebody gets pregnant
Haha, 4th quarter, R-O-B, hahaha, yeah...

[Intro]
Listen
I don't even wanna sing this song
Matter of fact
I'm just gon' talk through this
But I'ma talk on notes
But what I'ma be saying, is the realest
Listen

[Verse 1]
First (first), I'll (I'll), pop open a can of Red Bull (then I'll)
Mix it with some Belv' and pour it all over you
Once I get your body tweaking, girl I
Drop to my knees, and then I
Then (then), I'll (I'll), proceed on this mission to drive you, wild
Break out all the candles, oils and hot towels
I can feel you scratching my back while I'm on top
Damn girl

[Chorus]
Said you know the sex is good when your making those faces
And you know the sex is good when you're going aww baby
And you know the sex is good when your body's having fits
Toe curling, screaming out, son of a bitch
Said you know the sex is good when your coming for the fourth time
Know the sex is good when you can't get it off your mind
And you know the sex is good when you tell your best friend
The room was steaming, I was screaming, son of a bitch

[Verse 2]
Now two hours later we're still going at it
Girl from the basement all the way up to the attic
Tease you up until you tell me Kell I wanna grab it
And that's when I'm gonna bend you over, girl, and let you have it
You know

[Chorus]
Said you know the sex is good when your making those faces
(Said you know the sex is good when)
And you know the sex is good when you're going aww baby
And you know the sex is good (yeah) when your body's having fits (oh, ohh)
Toe curling, screaming out (woo!), son of a bitch
(Oh, oh oh ohh)
Said you know the sex is good when your coming for the fourth time (yeah)
Know the sex is when you can't get it off your mind
And you know the sex is good when you tell your best friend
The room was steaming, I was screaming, son of a bitch

[Verse 1: Kanye West & (Big Sean)]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on (whoa)
You should just go and throw a cape on (whoa)
And it’s just so amazing

[Interlude: Kanye West]
There goes the bed

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

She love the way I’m doing it (she do it)
So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on-on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'mma give it to ya)
The long way (And give it to ya)
The strong way (We at it all day)
It’s our day (It's like this always)
It’s our way (After a long day)
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Pre-Verse: Kanye West]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Talk to the, talk to the, hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl

[Verse 1]
Is this a warning?
My heart beatin' on an offbeat
Is this a caution
That I can't get enough for you and me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?

[Verse 1]
You take from me
So why you holding back? Boy, why you holding back?
So vacantly
But you won't get away with that, no, you won't get away with that

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Verse 2]
Don't wait for me
When you know you did me wrong, I've been holding on too long
Eventually
I’ll make the call

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time

My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game
She said tomorrow she don't want to wake up
Tears running through her makeup
I see her praying right before her dinner
Who knew she was such a sinner

She said tomorrow she don't want to wake up
Tears running through her makeup
Her mommy and daddy don't know what hit her
What made their baby such a sinner

She said tomorrow she don't want to wake up
Tears running through her makeup

She says tomorrow she'll be in heaven
1 2 3 4 5 666 7

She said tomorrow she don't want to wake up
Tears running through her makeup

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Nigga was motherfuckin' hyped up
Nigga just grabbed a nigga and snuffed a nigga
And it was on from there wasn't nothing stopping him holmes
(What did the rest of them niggas do)
Them motherfuckers was ready for anything
Them niggas was packing burners, niggas ready to fight with them
Niggas doing what they had to do holmes
Niggas on the real flip mode homes
Niggas coming out like a motherfucker
Niggas was antsy, like come on, come on, motherfuckers!

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
I walk slight but I carries a big stick
Nobody pay me close, hey Biggie buy another toast
My shit is set off
Somebody screaming somebody is shot
Is it over Crack, or a nigga will try to act?
The big city don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm in real form, ready to rush your dorm
Hold back your mom 'cause I came for your daughter
Is it time for slaughter, or should I pull the plug?
Sometimes I get wild lifted, and niggas tell me I bug
I claim now, this my set, somebody could be wet
Ayo Biggie, give me the word and I'll let out the herd
With that Uptown spliff, 45th inside the gift
And we can do this
Check it out

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
'Cause I was born a water baby
Swimming with these times
The grooves that turn the grey to sunshine
'Cause I will live through days that break me
Swimming with these times
The grooves that turn the grey to sunshine

[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
I'm still tryna write the story as I see it
The trouble is when I say it, they don't believe it
They reckon I only say it but I don't mean it
I'm tryna tell 'em I'd only say it if I can feel it
'Cause money's tight, maybe tighter than it was before
I'm helping out on a mortgage I really can't afford
Family breaking north, I cover the trips abroad
Shakin', I'm making another loss on another tour
But what I done it for?
To see my mother in the sun abroad
I run into trouble, that was coming for her
My little brother got the hunger for
All the exact same pain
That makes the rain in my stomach pour
So let me paint it broader
This for any dude who's got a daughter
Living off lines that your papa taught her
Ain't got no time to be coming for you
Go with the flow of this running water

[Refrain: Loyle Carner]
Go with the flow of this
Go with the flow of this
Go with the flow of this

[Verse 2: Tom Misch]
Don't you worry
Two leaves won't grow the same
And people might forget your name
Doesn't matter if they do
Don't you hurry
When the hot coffee pours will stain
And when the Uber left you in the rain
Your time will come around to you
Despite the stress of spending so much time alone
'Cause this ge-o-gra-phy is keeping me at home
And I don't know the way to go
I move with the flow of this running water, this running water

[Chorus: Tom Misch]
'Cause I was born a water baby
Swimming with these times
The grooves that turn the grey to sunshine
'Cause I will live through days that break me
Swimming with these times
The grooves that turn the grey to sunshine

[Outro: Loyle Carner]
Go with the flow of this running water

[Intro: T-Pain]

Before me and Kodak roll through slowly
Holding a .44 ting at 4 in the morning (ooh)

'Cause everyone morning she starting to throw up
Gotta hit a lick, can't mess up (why?)
I know she 'boutta run my check up (ohh)

She in love with a Florida nigga, she don't wanna leave Tallahassee

[Chorus 1: T-Pain]
You can't kill me, nigga, I swear that I've been died before (bitch)

I rep that shit from the 850 down to the Florida Keys (yah)
Set my nigga Kodak free (why?), that ain't where he supposed to be (oh yeah)

That shit don't sound right to me

[Chorus 2: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you gon' ride for me

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Baby, that's blasphemy, yeah
Baby, you're bad for me, yeah
Say you gon' clap for me, yeah
Say you gon' blast for me, yeah
Why you ain't show me none of the love you say you have for me, yeah
I was goin' through tragedy
Bitch, I needed you drastically, yeah
I'ma just switch my flow up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no throw up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no check up, yeah
Boy, you need to run your check up, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, can't catch up, ayy
Hit her face down with her ass up, ayy
Even when I'm fucking, I'm masked up, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus 2: Kodak Black & XXXTENTACION]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (what)
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me (ayy)
And you say that you gon’ ride with me

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
I ain’t gon' do the nigga shit 'cause I’m too good for features, huh
I ain’t gon’ fuck the nigga bitch 'cause I know she a eater, huh (ayy)
Last time I wifed a bitch she told the world I beat her, huh
And when they locked Lil Kodak up, my nigga I couldn’t believe it, huh (ayy)
Ayy lil' shawty, pop my whoadie
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking yuh
Hit her from the back, damn that bitch bleeding

[Outro: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby

Hot Sugar in the house

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high, everything high (so high)
Everything high (so high)

[Bridge: Big Sean]

Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Cause the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high, everything high (so high)
Everything high (so high)
It's time to go, its time to go (so high)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
If you roll one up, I'mma roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke? Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a V8, I filled it with carrots
I'm popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high, everything high (so high)
Everything high (so high)

Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 4: Chiddy Bang]
I'm fly, my swell on Priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just write rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud, yea it's worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it comes to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fakin', licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in Chanel
And you know errthang' high when you livin' swell

[Hook: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high, everything high (so high)
Everything high (so high)
It's time to go, its time to go (so high)
It's time to go, its time to go
It's time to go

You're gonna wanna hang it on the wall
Next to the door I walked out of

[Pre-Chorus]
(What now?)
That's the perfect spot for our love

Right by the door I walked out of
(What now?)
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
I'm good decoration

[Pre-Chorus]
The colors of your walls are depressing
The photo of me will brighten your place
You know it outta go
Right by the door that I walked out of
That's the perfect spot for our love
Right by the door I walked out of
Just to remind you of what you lost
Everytime you walk out that door

[Chorus]
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration
Now isn't that nice
I'm your ex-girl plus some good decoration

Now you can fall in love with a picture of me
But it's not real
It's make believe
It'll never be true
It'll never love you back like I did
Back then

Ya Ya Ya

[Intro: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don’t let go

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you’re not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That’s why I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 2: Nikki Flores]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don’t go
Baby, the worst jail is

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
Waking up alone in a world where you’re not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I’m looking in your eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
Like a nightlight
Like a teddy bear
Like a toddler’s blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
Ooooooo, yeah

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores] x2
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
Yeah, it's real simple bitch
You understand me?
Bitch I'm a player now
Your main bitch works for me
Yeah. Yeah
I haven't worn a shirt since 1993
That's the year I moved my operation to the beach
Half a dozen cameras on me when I'm in the streets
Pop, pop!
Hit out on me
Building mansions on the sand
Your girl looks like Kelis
She must hate you so much right now
She must hate you so much right now
Run my fingers through her hair
My girl looks like Kelis
Man she must love me so...

[Intro / Verse 1]
We missed the light show
(That's what I call the weather)
Missed it like a three, a three
You and me and
I'm so sorry
I meant to lift the blinds some
So the sun could show off on us
It kind of slips my mind
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea

[Verse 2]
See my reflection on your chanel
(vintage)
I just got those for you
(tight)
I put em on you
(haha)
If you want baby
I'd go and lift the blinds some
So the sun could have a look at ya
But I see you just fine
Whenever we're in bed

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

[Bridge]
Now just right
Round my head too
Keep em on
When we going
Going strong
Got the red ones
With the polarized tint on em
Oh

[Chorus]
The way you shine
The way you glow
The sun ain't got much on you baby, yea
So i'm wearing these frames while we're doing it
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea
Wayfarers in bed while she doing me
Wayfarers in bed while we're doing it, yea

Shades on, lights off
But you on
And I'm on you
Oh yea
Go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Forbidden from the beginning
I saw her there (up there)
Been like that since I met her
They said I couldn't have her
Way out of my league
I never believed it
I gotta get her heart
I gotta make her mine

[Verse 2]
But what if she just tells me
I'm not quite her speed or
Shows me her bares hands
And crushes my ego
Dismiss me as a kid
Tell me I'm barely legal
But bareley legal

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no

[Verse 3]
This conversation is taking us for a loop
Taking you serious is difficult to do
Cause I don't believe ya
When you say that you don't
Ever look at me quite that way
You say that you trying to settle down
But you say I'm handsome
I should be having fun
I shouldn't move fast
So I went faster
Cause it ain't no fun
Without ya

[Chorus]
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
I slept with someone I little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Who loves ya

Girl if I gotta show ID (show ID)
I'm gonna (gonna)
Won't let you get in
Trouble
For messing with someone a little younger
Younger, no
Oh-oh
Female weather girl

In front of the camera
Morning and night
Letting me know when it pours or drizzle light
My confidence in you has reached its peak
One day will last me through the peak

I know you're such....

[Verse 1]
Tell me where your style, where you know the life
Tell me how you fit, girl, you fit your time
I'm not tryna make you heed from light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't wanna take, but I need to flow
Tell me how to let what you want to know
I know what to say for you believe in love
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
So much in the way now, I don't wanna sleep
So much to weigh down, join me
If I could lay down, tell me how to sleep
No one to lay down, I don't wanna sleep

[Post-Chorus]
See baby, don't worry, I said sorry
Don't block me, oh baby, my baby
Control me, you want me

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna say we could talk a lot
I'm not tryna make it, we can get in touch
I know what you're sayin' make enough from love
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't wanna solve what you love to do
And the way you talkin' when I'm set to new
I'm just tryna leave it all to truth and you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
So much in the way now, I don't wanna sleep
So much to weigh down, join me
If I could lay down, tell me how to sleep
No one to lay down, I don't wanna sleep

[Post-Chorus]
See baby, don't worry, I said sorry
Don't block me, oh baby, my baby
Control me, you want me

[Intro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
I'ma just leave this right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Uh-uh-uh-mmmm
Care to debate me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sick shit
I thought so

[Verse]
Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up, keep my main bitch put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
Your thot need to get her look up, ugh
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, ugh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, ugh
That ain't sauce, that's pudding, ugh
Tunechi 'cross her bosom, damn
Shooting up the jurors, damn
Don't name my pistol, I named the trigger
"Benjamin Button," push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitches' friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch is giving me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, J.C. Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winning, win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artist or a starving artist
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeerers
Now your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And the cash, it triple; flip, kick, jiujitsu
Throwing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons
And her man a simper, so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec, I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide, but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walking 'round my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talking out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it
We put out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostituting
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with the contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Getting the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lollapaloo-zo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hitting some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to JuCo
I had to ask 'em, "What's four plus two, though?" Rrr!

[Outro]
My ultimate basketball dream team
The starting five would most likely be umm
Of course I'ma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm
This gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul
Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
And umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry
You already know that's my starting five, I got money on them
Holla at ya boy

[Part I]

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
She don't dance, but she dance for me

Got a chicken in my kitchen and she cookin' for me
Go to B-Town, all these brown boys start to lookin' like me
I'm the one they wanna see, now all they fuckin' is me
She hold me down so I ain't got time for no side hoes
She hold it down and she won't say shit to the 5-0
Blow it down like every week we smokin' 5 oz
If the doors don't go up, we don't want that Lambo' (Yeah, skrrt)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
She go outta town every weekend (Weekend)
See her out in public, we ain't speakin' (We ain't speakin')
Oh when we alone, it's a freak ting
When we get alone, pants downs, no speak ting (Yeah, yeah)
I been on the real nigga vibe with my .40
Why you gotta lie? You ain't my shawty
Actin' like you can, but can't afford me
Hands down, get the bitches by majority (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Sippin' Hennessy, lil mama, pour it

And I pull up late nights, have you soakin', yeah

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Tory Lanez]
Dance for me, baby
She don't dance but she
Fuck around and dance for me, baby
She love to do it with no hands for me, baby
Might fuck around and take a chance on me, baby
Rappers spendin' they whole advance on you, baby
Rollie shinin', that means it's perfect timin'
That mean it's time to get to throwin' these bands on you, baby
Hands on you, baby, signature, my name, tramp stamp on you, baby
Robbin' that pussy, Van Dam on you, baby
Throw the money tall like a handstand
Do it for myself, one band man on it

You only dance, only dance for me
Feel the adrenaline whenever you dance for me, yeah
Adrenaline rushin', adrenaline rushin'

Stack in trash bags but she ain't getting shit for free
You ain't fucking with a loser

Introduce to me to ya bestfriend
I'm feeling her vibes too
We can do it in the bedroom
I met her in a house party
Look at her body she sexy
Puerto Rican name is Zoe
She said her nigga was lazy
Now She keep calling me zaddy
And she got other Niggas pissed off
Cause I got convos cut off
Well, that midnight train pulled on all down the track
You’re standing there watching, with your hands tied behind your back
And you smile so pretty, and nod to the prison guard
Well, I know you want my loving, mama but you’re so hard

[Verse]
Walls slowly closin' in
I feel the time slowly runnin' out
I think my mind slowly losin' focus
Lately, I've been through the motions
I'm on another level this time
Levels in my bezel, rich time
They ain't on my level this time
Think it's time we settle this right now
And if I keep goin' back to fuckin' with her, with her
I'ma end up with her, oh
Always first to finish last, time to quit her, quit her
Time to give up, bitter, oh

[Outro]
This time, I'm...
This time...
I'm your first, I'm your last
I'm the best thing that you've ever had
This time...
This time...
Last time...
I'm the best of all time
Last t-

[Verse 1]
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

[Verse 2]
If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin and my voice  gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

[Outro]
Call me Joanne
XO, Joanne
XOXO, Joanne

[Intro]
(I'ma be alright because Dizzy here wildin')

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Okay, time to make my mark, I gave 'em a head start (Yeah)
Now I'm on my Nicki shit, I don't need no frauds (Nah)
Time to raise the bar, rappin' like I passed the bar (Yeah)
You would think I ride bikes, boy, the way I handle bars (Yeah)
Real niggas in charge (Yeah), we back for what's ours (Ours)
Poppin' all these blues, I might turn into an Avatar
They ain't wanna see me back, he's back
Human crack in the flesh, sorry, I had to relapse (Sorry)
These niggas weak, whack, I twist 'em like weed wraps
Still on my Nino Brown, still getting G money on G-packs (Woo)
No Stunna Man, bustin' like Duh Duh Man, it's evident
These hoes love me, they say my dick is they medicine
Cosby, spikin' gelatin, still pushin' and pedalin'
Settling never, I'm like DiCaprio in The Revenant
Still whippin' and stretchin' it, two pots, ambidextrous
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money, I'm fetchin' it
Your ho throwin' it at me, I'm catchin' it
Don't check me, go check your bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
From a tenant in the tenements to owning my residence (One)
Phone still clicking, I feel like the receptionist
Out of this world, yes, he is, extraterrestrian (Woo)
My life's a fucking movie, boy, don't get yourself edited (Out)
I'm like Steph at the free throw, that piece blow, I never miss
Taught your girl how to whip the girl, now she a lesbian (Yeah)
You can level up, still won't be on my level then, it's level ten
These niggas hot, I must be kettlin'
They don't want the steam, but I know you want the tea
That's your bitch? Why she only fuck with me? 'Cause I'm ballin', MSG (Ballin')
Roof missin' on this whip and I need two kitchens (Two)
Your bitch say I'm number two, yeah, too different (True)
Weakest get bagged, start singing, yeah, loose lippin' (Loose)
Tell the DA I ain't never been no stool pigeon (Never)
Won't catch me in no club unless my tool get in (Ever)
Be smart, 'cause Bounce, he a fool with it
It's on, say it's on, I'm 7-Eleven with it
That's twenty-four seven with it, wherever, whatever with it, yeah (Wherever)
Your mama gon' need a church with a reverend in it
Just pray it's a heaven in it, and hope that they let you in it, yeah
