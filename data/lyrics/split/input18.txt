[Intro]
I know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance
And go to the deep end
Usher, baby
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trekking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me
Shedding all your innocence

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid

[Chorus]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive

[Verse 2]
Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby, going deeper ain't gon' kill me
And I love the rush I get from it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid

[Chorus]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive

[Bridge]
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling, baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew I don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

[Chorus]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
That I knew I was ready, baby
To take that dive
Call me cool in the game
Because I make it rain
And I'm cool like a fool in the summer
Yes, I need a plumber
Because I make the girls leak
If you don't believe me you go and hear my girl speak
Yeah my dick be perfect
Yeah my dick N'Sync
Call it Justin Timberlake
And I always wear pink
Yeah
I always make dumb money
The world's Patty Mayonnaise and I'm Doug funny

[Intro]
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn’t any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn’t any good

[Verse 1]
I’ll take the wrong path
I think I’ll go a little off track
And now there’s no way back
You took all the apples that I had

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you’ll rock my world

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

[Verse 2]
Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shinin' bright in the dark
Liftin' up my little red skirt
I know you’ll leave me here in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

[Bridge]
Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing’s wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you’re tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you’ll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

[Intro]
She was coming on to me, I was coming on to her
Hit the town and shoot the breeze, baby don't you fight the curse
She was making love to me, I was holding on to her
Hit the town and shoot the breeze, baby don't you fight the curse

[Verse 1]
Ah, just give me that bass
She listening to Ross now, give me that face
I ain't tryna chase, tryna get to third base
'til I hit a home run 3, 2, 1, we safe
Damn she a looka, ran outta liquor
Sweet-sweet pusha, give me that gusha
I ain't tryna spit game, maybe we can hook up
The Aston out front, so my nickname Kutcher
Dinner date time, down inner state 9
I'm in the state of mine like a dinner date's fine
We can go to the condo and drink wine
She wanna to be my girl but it'll take time
She like where the cognac, why we drink wine?
Cause the wine get you open, heard through the grape vines
First dim the lights close the drape blinds
Then I scratch that kitty word to my K-9's
Don't spur show fur big grill gleaming
Polar no firm when the ship season
Got 'em red bottoms look like your heels bleeding
I fuck a hundred bitches to these day we still speaking
And they still creeping, got 'em still cheating
(You sound like me in my heyday)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Got 'em still cheating, got 'em still creeping
Text me on the phone said the panties still leaking (Nasty)
She came four times, had the bitch tweaking (Tripping)
Jump up in the ride, loud how you reaking (Turn that down)
Then she went down, on lookers peeking (Somebody's looking)
I had them dark tints it’s hard for them to see in
She bust 'em all loss 'em rollin' we was leaving
That's another reason, to only let the freak in (Where you at?)
That type of action, happen every third weekend (Where you at?)
Took all type of trips, 'til my mileage got frequent (I got free flights this year)
Shit, and my proposals came indecent
She musta told her friends cause I here 'em ki-ki'ing
(I saw your girlfriend last night) About this money and V's that we be in
We getting money new V's each season (What's this fall?)
The champagne caught me, vision kind of sloppy (Who that?)
Kickin' it to this broad but my speech is kind of choppy
I told her let's split, her reply was copied
So when a nigga split, you know we jump up in the high V
Damn, I think she caught an orgasm
This gold diggin bitch caught a whore spasm (Nasty)
I’m a cold nigga bitch and I the Porsche spazzing
You know the Porsche waggon, four door cabin (I'm on him)
I’m getting money so of course I’m braggin (Count that)
I had the bitch high like she was on saturn (Nah, you aight, baby)
But they get confused with my thought patterns
While we smoking blunts by the port landing

[Intro: Ninja]
Mmm, you smell that?
You know what that smell is?
That's right, it's money!
Go ahead, rub your dick on that shit!

[Hook: Ninja]

Rubbing my dick on XPEN$IVE SH1T

[Verse 1: Ninja]
Told my daddy I was gonna grow up to be
A superstar rapper making big money, know what I mean girl?
But my daddy told me I was living in a dream world
If I said "Yes dad" I wouldn't have my zef swag
Or fly round the whole fokken world gettin' jet lag
Gettin' bitten by the zef bug is the best drug
If I played it safe, I woulda never made it ever
Now every day in every way I get a little zeffer
No matter what you smoke, you'll never get as high as me
It's like a fat fuck you when these naaiers see
My big billboard up in NYC
Don't you wish your boyfriend was zef like me?
I'm the motherfuckin' greatest, suckers love to hate us
But I make these bitches submissive cause I'm a dominator
I'm mad musical, my rhymes are the tightest
That's why I tap beautiful designer vaginas

[Hook: Ninja]

[Verse 2: Ninja]
Baby I'm an angel, sent from the dark side
Took my brush-cut to the next with peroxide
"Oh my god, that's such a fresh switch!"
Ja, whatever, just don't touch the hair bitch
Everybody's crying saying; "Hip-hops dead"
'til a white South African hip-hop head
Pops up on the scene sayin' "It's not dead!"
I'm here, can I get a fokken aah yeah?
Rappers looking at me like I just crawled out the drain
The underground got me bored out my brain
And this pop-rap bullshit all sound the same
God help you if I call out your name
From the dark side of the moon, I zoom outta the gloom
Doom doom! The room goes boom like a cartoon
The dark ravers has come, my mic-saber is on
Turn and tell your friend; "Yo this is my favourite song!"

[Hook: Ninja]
I rub my dick on XPEN$IVE SH1T

Make my dreams come true

[Verse 1]
I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing my girl will be there

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you happy, girl?
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well, that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you

[Chorus]
For last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right

[Verse 2]
In your eyes, I see a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now, I'll wash my hands
'Cause I love ya babe, love ya babe
Pharrell say "Don't do it the same"
But I say ain't playing my games
But for you, my soul still remains
'Cause I love ya babe, love ya babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you happy, girl?
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well, that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you

[Chorus]
For last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right

[Bridge]
I hope you're thinking (Remember girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in (If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
Well, I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel)
About you, you

[Chorus]
Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right

[Chorus]
Last night (Just-a last night)
Can't believe what I was hearing (Just can't believe it, baby)
Telling me to have a nice life (Oh)
So tonight (Yeah)
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'mma do for me what's right
(Got something I wanna tell ya, girl)

[Bridge]
I hope you're thinking (Tell me girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in (If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
Well, I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel)
About you (Let me tell you one more time)

[Bridge]
I hope you're thinking (Tell me girl, when I was your man)
(My baby)
I hope it sinks in (If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well, I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel)
About you

[Outro]
Oh, baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See, I ain't gonna be the one
Ain't gonna play these games with you
But I still love you
Remember girl when I was your man?
Ain't nothing gonna take that away
No, no, no, no, no, no-no
See, I remember
In December
We were walking holding hands
And I was your man
Can't we just get back to that?
Baby

[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus 1]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus 2]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus 3]
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

[Chorus]
Okay, I get lost in the night
Faded off of that brown
We can take shots of that white
Realest niggas around
Tell me would you like it, would you like it if I let you call me Big
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live
And treat it like it ain't shit

[Post-Chorus]
Now ask me how it feel

Turn every dream I had real
So tell me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Man to be around a nigga this real

[Verse 1]
You know I need everything in plural
That's benji's and euro's
I just came back from that Paris
My life is moving in turbo
My pinky ring just dingling
Look how I'm sipping my merlot
Look how I'm hittin' my herbal
Praise God, church ho
What the fuck is you saying?
B.I.G, I'm the mayor in the bitch
Ol' fur coat looking like a bear in this bitch
OH! fuck is you wearing? that's embarrassin' shit
Man and to my new girls that's hearing this shit
You fucking with an OG, you should cherish this shit
Man they tell me that they love me, I ain't hearing that shit
They trynna get up in my will and inherit that shit
That's why I'm faded, I'm wasted
I'm living life like it's no jail
House bigger than a hotel
But these hoes tell
So I still take their ass to the hotel
And my ho tell
I got a bad bitch with that body
And a badder bitch in that lobby
Boy that's just how I got it
When I...

[Chorus]
Okay, I get lost in the night
Faded off of that brown
We can take shots of that white
Realest niggas around
Tell me would you like it, would you like it if I let you call me Big
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live
And treat it like it ain't shit

[Verse 2]
Bad bitches that came through
I'm hitting all that I aim to
So stoned I can't move
So stoned I can't move
She go either way like it's game two
She look at her phone praying it ain't you
Living out all the rumors
Then afterwards, say it ain't true
Man I'm daydreaming while sexing
Her screams remind me I'm in it
And all this champagne that I'm popping
Reminded me that I'm winning
I know we shouldn't get so high
Yea, remind me that when I'm finished
But this the life we chose
It's the only life that we know
Reminiscing when I had no job
Back when I woulda robbed yo job
Me and my niggas on the streets dog
Throwing signs up like we roadside
Now the suits and pasta both bowtie
My Greek girls scream "opa"
My Spanish girls scream "no más"
And all the Black girls scream "don't stop!"

[Chorus]
Okay, I get lost in the night
Faded off of that brown
We can take shots of that white
Realest niggas around
Tell me would you like it, would you like it if I let you call me Big
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live
And treat it like it ain't shit

[Intro]
"Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?"
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what

Bada, bada, bada doo da

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now
Walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock"
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, "Damn, that's a cold ass honkey"
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in her skirt
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella though
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

[Interlude]
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Bridge: Wanz]
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I’m in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on!)

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Outro]
"Is that your grandma's coat?"

[Intro: The Wilcannia Mob]
Hoy, hoy, hoy
Testing one
Go, one, two, three, four
Wilcannia Mob
M.I.A
Morganics

[Chorus: The Wilcannia Mob]
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'

[Verse 1: Wally Ebsworth]
They call me Wally, this is where I'm at
I wear my NRL baseball cap
Parramatta's my team if you know what I mean
To be the captain, that's my dream

[Verse 2: Keith Dutton]
My name is Keith from Wilcannia Street
I walk on stilts to read the beat
When it crawls out, I shake a leg
This is my rhyme and that's what I said

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
First of all I wanna say
I don't really know why you act that way
My name is Maya and people always say
I act kinda strange like a dooba weh
I like fish and mango pickle
When I climb trees, them feet, them tickle
I'm broke this month, didn't pay rent
I had to jump town and my money's all spent (all spent)
I had to jump town and my money's all spent

[Chorus: The Wilcannia Mob]
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'

[Interlude: The Wilcannia Mob]
We-we-we play some didge'
We-we-we play some didge'
We-we-we play some didge'

[Verse 4: Colin "Colroy" Johnson]
Well Colroy's here, have no fear
All you old pigs better watch out for this bit
And I'm here at the game and I'm almost ten
I wanna be an actor like Jackie Chan

[Verse 5: Lendal King]
Lendal is my name; I like to do back flips
Listen to the words that come from my lips
Jump off the bridge and I'll play the didge
And when I catch a fish, I put it in the fridge

[Verse 6: Buddy Blair]
My name is Buddy, I can't stand still
Wilcannia to Dubbo to Broken Hill
I've been movin' around from town-to-town
And this is how I get down!

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
Rode the BMX when we walked through the bush
The boys fight to ride it, but I just let 'em push
Keith stole an egg from a lil' cuckoo
Kept it safe in his mouth, while he danced jookoo jookoo

[Verse 7: M.I.A.]
There's only one ocean that got fish left
One day we'll have to be a really good chef
And I don't mean us in the bush making meth
Boys if you catch meth you catch your death
When I said that Keith sneezed and had a chick
Broke the little egg in his mouth in little bits

[Chorus: The Wilcannia Mob]
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'
When it's really hot, we go to the river and swim
When we're goin' fishin', we catchin' the bream
When the river's high, we jump off the bridge
And when we get home, we play some didge'

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I bet her panties on the floor now, hey
I can see it going down, I'm ready now
And I don't wanna wait another minute, no
So I won't, girl, I'm gonna handle business, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope she's naked in the bed, bed, bed
I hope she tell me what she want just so I could do whatever she says
I hope she puts me to the test, what's next? Girl, I came prepared, yeah
Give it to her body real good, get up in her head, her head

[Chorus]
And no it ain't my crib, but I'm coming home
Daddy's little girl, I'ma treat you like you grown
Show you how I feel, ain't that what you want?
When I hit the door, all the clothes coming off
And once I hit, there ain't nothing better for sure
And once I'm in, you gon' say it's forever yours, it's forever yours
Tell me it's forever yours, forever yours
Yours, yours tell me it's forever yours, hey

[Verse 2]
Walking in the door now, hey
Candles burning all around, she's ready now
And there ain't no bounds, no limits, no
I'ma hold you so close when we finish

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl I hope, I hope she's naked in the bed, you are, you are
I hope she tell me what she want, just so I could do whatever she says, tell me baby
I hope she puts me to the test, what's next? Girl, I came prepared, yeah
Give it to her body real good, get up in her head, her head

[Chorus]
And no it ain't my crib, but I'm coming home
Daddy's little girl, I'ma treat you like you grown
Show you how I feel, ain't that what you want?

And once I hit, there ain't nothing better for sure
And once I'm in, you gon' say it's forever yours, it's forever yours
Tell me it's forever yours, forever yours
Yours, tell me it's forever yours

[Bridge]
I wanna do it real slow, if that's okay
I wanna take my time and make your day
Make your night turn into the morning
Forever yours
I wanna do it real slow, if that's okay
I wanna take my time and make your day
Make your night turn into the morning
From sunrise, down onto the evening
Change sheets six times and that's just for the weekend
Call me the plumber man from the way it be leaking
Gone so long, girl, I'm happy to be back
Yes, I'm in the zone, can't another nigga match
I hope she's naked in the bed
Promise I'ma do what these other niggas said
They would if they could

[Chorus]
And no it ain't my crib, but I'm coming home
Daddy's little girl, I'ma treat you like you grown
Show you how I feel, ain't that what you want?
When I hit the door, all the clothes coming off
And once I hit, there ain't nothing better for sure
And once I'm in, you gon' say it's forever yours, it's forever yours
Tell me it's forever yours, forever yours
Yours, tell me it's forever yours, hey
Stressed out, uptight, overworked, riled up
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side
Follow me, where we're going, we don't need no bread crumbs
Can't you see, baby? You're the only one

You are among the few hot women
Let me be your medicine
Cause I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby, fly away

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Baby, that's all for you to do, let your body be
I'll lick you down, I'll make you feel like you're out of body
The doctor's here for you
Take you like Twilight, I'll bite your neck
You don't have to stay in the rain, I'll get you wet, yeah
Push you up against the wall, turn you out and turn you on
Yea, yea, whoa

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Girl, it's your body we can do whatever you like
Girl, it's your body we can do whatever you like
It's your body we can ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock, oh oh oh oh

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy
It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to

Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Cooking chicken on the wall with the system up on full?

[Verse 1]
Magpies on fire
Making love like little wolves out on the porch
Can lead to medicine
Oh well, I'm game for anything at all

[Verse 2]
Scarecrow's a liar
Spins a yarn and no one ever checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
All along it's like a bird
Who's trapped alone inside your cage, love

[Chorus]
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

[Post-Chorus 1]
All in all it's just the call
Of something wild beyond your room
There's a changing of the major chord
Your minor threat will do, love

[Verse 3]
My gun misfired
Shot myself instead, I guess I always knew
I'd be the one to lose
That screen door slams, time to make a move

[Interlude]
Help me!

[Chorus]
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

[Post-Chorus 2]
All in all it's like a bird
Who's trapped alone inside your cage, love
A bird who's born to live at half your age, girl
A bird who's never really had a say
Yeah!

[Chorus]
What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

[Outro]
Least of all she's like a bird
Who's now been freed from someone's cage

[Verse 1]
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone

[Chorus]
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

[Verse 2]
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

[Chorus]
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

[Outro]
There is another world
There is a better world
There must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye

[Verse 1]
Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide
From the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation, minds decay

[Verse 2]
Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation
Victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

[Bridge]
Buildings crashing down
To earth's cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood
Ice melt into blood
Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Terrifying rain
Is a burning pain
(Electric Funeral)
(Electric Funeral)
(Electric Funeral)
(Electric Funeral)

[Verse 3]
And so, in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes Earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to Hell
Ever trapped in burning cells

[Instrumental Outro]

[Hook]
(V-Nasty)
Yeah, my favorite color purple
Sippin' on that purple, smokin' on that purple
You ain't got that get the fuck up out my circle
Bitch get the fuck up out my circle

(Gucci Mane)
Yeah, my favorite color purple
Sippin' on that purple, smokin' on that purple
You ain't got that get the fuck up out my circle
Bitch get the fuck up out my circle

(Verse 1: Gucci Mane)
Gucci mane and I'm talkin' bout rounds and shit
V-Nasty alley oop the brick and I slam the shit
I'm kinda country when I talk, you understand this shit?
I'm not romantic but I cook my dope candle lit
I ain't helpful for these hoes like a cancer stick
And if a chick act up, she a cancer bitch
Its Gucci Nickelodeon and you just the custodian
I never say never so I might be cookin' dope again
The ball is in my court
I love ma partnas _______
Worship in Detroit and they love me in New York
Half a million on the floor, another million on the table
Purple Drank, Purple Lean, Purple Pills, Purple Label

[Hook]

(Verse 2: V-Nasty)
Bitch its Nasty
Said I'm high off the liquid
Lean queen aka the Brick Kid
At ya front door
Bitch I hear shit
Got whole bricks, cos I'm sippin'
You know me girl, I'm rollin' up the purple stuff
High of the lean
Bitch I can't get enough
I'm on the block, never walkin' lonely
At night in the hood, rockin' with my 40
Knocking at ya window, 3 in the morning
30 city trip, ho I be touring
Take a bitch money while she on vacation
Why you saying I ain't mobbin', cos im Caucasian?

[Hook]
Woke  up in the hotel with another nigga down peace
It's something bout you baby girl
I'm in love with yo mouthpiece
You deserve them new Giseppes
I had to buy them new Giseppes
Million dollar nigga my bitch so lucky that she met me
You flexin hard on soft beach jump out with matching giseppes
I bought some kids some new giseppes
(more)

[Verse (Spoken)]
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin’ in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause he’s tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin’, nobody’s hirin’
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin’
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not
Pensions bein’ snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin’ protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later it’s back to normal
But they say times are changin’
The revolution is becoming second nature, causes are combining
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices ‘cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners

[Produced by Soundtrakk]

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag
'Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto, and then, you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab, corruption is the swinger
Sitting high, riding dirty, drag racing into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore
'Cause I don't know what really matters anymore

[Hook: Casey Benjamin]
Man, it ain't mean
The strangest thing you've ever seen
Oh, would you look at how they swing?
Would you look at how they swing?
They ain't dead, though
No, I didn't die y'all
I cut myself down
And I admire my fall, into grace

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now, as I wander through the city going mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummying down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river, get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad
Hating on your happiness, you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad
Hello, Evil—I'm back!

[Hook: Casey Benjamin]
Man, it ain't mean
The strangest thing you've ever seen
Oh, would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing?
They ain't dead though
No, I didn't die y'all
I cut myself down
And I admire my fall, into grace

[Intro]
"Black panther, black panther, what do you see?
I see a dreaming child watching over me!”
Back, nigga, yeah, hey
Can we get a little break
From the cocaine and the kilos?
Aiight nigga, we know
Aiight nigga, we know
Can we get a break
From the strippers on the p-ole?
Aiight nigga, we know
Okay nigga, we know

[Verse 1]
Hey shawty, ain’t no future in no gang bang
And ain’t no manhood in no bang bang
Ain’t no honor cleaning interstates inside a chain gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry, "nigga said a Camry?"
Watch that hoe depreciate and then you’ll understand me
It’s called being fiscally responsible
Don’t let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
The TV’s not your father, fool, that video’s not your mama
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster

[Hook]
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah

[Verse 2]
I know you’re sayin’, “Lupe rappin’ ‘bout the same shit”
Well, that’s ‘cause ain’t shit changed, bitch
And please don’t excuse my language
Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent
The true expression of my anguish
And by this far I ain’t shocked, upset, or appalled
I’m ashamed, bitch
I can’t listen if you ain’t sayin’ shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous
Ain’t buildin’ up they confidence, we teachin’ ‘em that they ain’t shit
If they ain’t got the latest that they saw on someone famous
Mercy of the Lord on this double-edged sword
Instead of askin’ where the hoes is
Maybe maybe may we have some roses

[Hook]
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world

[Verse 3]
Called the president a terrorist
Corporate sponsors like, how the fuck you gon’ embarrass us?
Ain’t my fault, I was just repeatin’ this
Professor Emeritus from America
But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home
Blew that bitch up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian throwing stones
The fuck you think they call him? I’mma leave that all alone
Cause this, the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness
It’s that great American rap-rap ferocious

[Hook]
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar, ital, iyah

[Intro]
God is great!

[Verse 1]
Ghettos, America. U.S. to the izzay
Killa in the citywide sprizzay
Where there's sunshine in the shizzade
Judge won't pull him out the pen like a grenade
For acting out their fears like a charade
Til they blacking out their tears like it's lights out
Bring em out the black like a lighthouse
And wave to em before they wiped out
Lifesaver, threw em, hope they catch it
But it's so Titanic to be iced out
That's just scratching the surface like Triple Axels
Want to roll around that Bentley like Crystal Castles
In addition to the chain
That's just to take the attention from the pain
Or is it the mission of the man
Audubon Ballroom, Motel Lorraine

[Hook]
Now white people, you can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
Cause God made us better than that

[Verse 2]
No break, all wake
Little mayhem for your All-State, nay ham, all steak
Get a good ball great like a golf grade
Make the ball break
Just one swing, no putting
That's how I try 'n does things, always
Especially when your past is
Martin, Baldwin, Audubon Ballroom
Turn the glass ceiling to a glass floor
Make a trampoline out of trapdoor
On that gasoline when I was back poor
Loudly crafted out my dream underneath a tap floor
Backpack battle-cat underground rap lore
Anonymous but dominant -- what's a Mac to a hacker?
In other words, we lyrical Zuckerbergs
Pimp you may move a mouse, but what's a rat to a cat store
It's like a gig to an app store
I rap Black history, you can only see my past if you fast forward

[Hook]
Now white people, you can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
Cause God made us better than that

[Verse 3]
Black Panthers, black anthems, black blues
With black answers for black stanzas: Langston Hughes
Breaking rules, ain't it cool?
Took it old, and made it new
Black painters, musical black anger
Black mothers, beautiful black anchors
So lets hear it for 'em! Let's hear it for 'em!
Lets hear it for 'em! Lets hear it for 'em!
Black America! Trap America!
'80s Babies! Crack America!
Rap America! Bad as Erykah!
From the era of family tearing up
But we just won big, can't be undid
Form a whole culture in just one kid
Miami dope boys, Oakland militants
Harlem Renaissance it's our deliverance

[Hook]
Now white people, you can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
Cause God made us better than that

[Verse 1]
Put one in the air like the king's son
For the heir to the kingdom
That means I'mma be the king once the king done
If he don't wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him
I sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
Diamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringlings
That's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run
And kept the kings comin' in obscene sums
You see for me it's life or death like a king thumb
Mean something
That's why I don't play when I relay like a team run
And treat every single day like a scene one
Outlook on life like I ain't never seen none

[Hook]
I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High

[Verse 2]
Post coast to coast gotta dose of every lingo
The latest famous 80's baby like the dingo
Who evaded pushing daisies, dodge bullets like Remo
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo
Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps own
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home
It's Lupe and I ain't from there
But they root for the away
Yeah they stunned there
Beautifully I play
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now
Usually I stay, put em on the roof with more truth for me to say

[Hook]
I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High

[Verse 3]
The laboratory happy for me cause I'm back with my belongings
Ferrari 'bout as red as when Carrie was the prom queen
Think outside the box like Larry Merchant, Don King
A glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs
Yeah, keep em in the air like a swan wing
And Imma keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot
You be talkin' bout your kush, you should come and hear my lawn sing
So put them up like a robbery
A Derrick Rose lob to me
And watch and see I alley-oop it properly
Football or volley-b, hock-el-y, or sock-el-y
You just get the rock to me
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie
I'll lock you in a locker b
Like Bruce Leroy, locked Johnny in a locker see
Shock is the only thing that 2Pac is toppin' me
Hot as rocket bottoms or Kilauea lava be

[Hook]
I keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)
Face to the future tell it hi (hi)
Everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high
High
High
High

[Chorus: Pooh Bear]
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I'm just a conduit
To keep you calm through it
So you respond lucid
That means you're non-foolish
When it's gone, stupid
You think you gonna lose it
But you don't bounce, you just bond to it
Like you Sean Con or Gorilla Glue-ish
With a blonde in your palm, King Kong in your coolness..
But they still tryna knock you off the roof kid
Singing you the blues, you crayon up the music
Change it into rainbows and rubics
Keep telling yourself you the wave of the future Howard Hughes is
It's huge if you refuse to blow your fuses
You blow up, exactly how Lu did..

[Chorus: Pooh Bear]
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I hope my stories can keep you off Maury
Away from weigher far from mandatory
Which means, through the mail only way you see the shorties
Keep your sons out the slums and your daughters
Out of orgies
Look in the mirror, see yourself and adore thee
Whisper in your ear, I fear nothing that's before me
And always remember that you're royalty
From the lions roar until it's Porky
And everything that's in between
Make sure you cherish every scene
And put on the biggest show your adversaries ever seen
Now even if you've never limousined
Important, yeah you're very there
There's red carpet everywhere

[Chorus: Pooh Bear]
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Just know I got your back, yeah I got it, and I will go to bat
Like Gotham's under attack I will spot em, keep you from ever touching the mat
Be your Robin, bring that onomatopoeia
Down upon all your problems like "zap! boom! bang!"
Cause all of y'all my pals
I tribune all your tribulations, channel through your trials
Please God, help keep the value in my vows
A man of my words that Vanna turns around
And if your fortune turns, I never turn you down
No matter who your healthcare provider, I'm a rider
Even if I gotta bring defibrillators out
A John Q on cue just for you
Peace out

[Chorus: Pooh Bear]
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor

[Verse 1]
May the Lord have mercy on my soul
Forgive me for my fetishes, my purchases, my clothes
Allow me to catch my rhythm so the nervousness just goes
That's why I sound so certain in my verses and my flows
The verbiage gets merciless this wordsmithness just rolls
I've tuned into my pertinence, my purposes, my goals
The feeling when you realize you've been working for your foes
And the curtains have just opened and they worthlessness exposed
You remember where you came from, where the purchases was stole
There was nothing in the oven and just work up on the stove
And you blossomed from the bottom, yeah, you worked with it and rose
From nothing to a dozen and a gardener there grows
Tell 'em!

[Hook: Poo Bear]
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart (That's me)
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart
(Yessir)
Brave heart
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart
(You know) Brave heart

[Verse 2]
May the Lord have mercy on my soul
Like Scholls keep cushion where I land
Keep the devil off my heels
But please keep me on my toes
Like a reposessor checking for everything I drove
Like I owe, but I don't
Paid my dues from the go
Doing donuts in the door, keep my shoes on the floor
Revered by the rich, plus approved by the poor
I've been sped up where they sniff it
(I've been sped up where they sniff it)
And screwed up where they pour
See I flew so way up high
And I SCUBA'd way down low
Put the top down on my fears
Put the roof up on my woes
I dropped that food and liquor to put you up on my stove
They shoplifted and stole
That just let me know they know
That was Lupe #1 now this version #4
And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
From the surface to the core
I took on the biggest wave
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode
That boat is now my bed, desk, dressers and my drawers
Now that's a house of pain!
Plus I use nooses when I hang up all my clothes
Couldn't change up if I chose
That's me

[Hook: Poo Bear]
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart (That's me)
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart
(Yessir)
Brave heart
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart
(You know) Brave heart

[Outro]
May the lord have...
Mercy on my soul

[Verse 1]
At my brother's Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like..
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless
An inspiration and a king
They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring
Protect it with every feather on the wings
So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing

[Chorus]
Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...

[Verse 2]
Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it

[Chorus]
Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...

[Verse 3]
In the studio writing these words, one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
Right in the back of this chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories

[Chorus]
Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...

[Outro]
Ride around, you know what I'm saying
All over the world right? I mean, everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying
Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love
Just riding around bumping that, uh
Either Jay or Nas, or me
He used to tell em like "yeah you alright"
But you ain't fucking with my man
It was always like that, so
Drop a little for you, let it bump
This that Esco music, it's that Esco music
Bumping with my Esco music, that raw
See you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum

[Chorus: Jason Evigan]
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes and
What they think are islands are much more in their size and
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here, and for five hundred years
Torture, terror, fear 'til they nearly disappear

[Chorus: Jason Evigan]
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
How can land be owned by another man?
Warns, "One can not steal what was given as a gift;
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish?"
But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built
And all mistakes will be repeated
By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement
And in your rush to have the most, from the day you left your boats
You'll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts

[Chorus: Jason Evigan]
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they were civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out
But this must be the temple
This White House

[Chorus: Jason Evigan]
This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

[Gorilla]
Hey, can you tell Mr. Zookeeper to please order me a 1000 pounds of banana pudding
I would love that
Y, colorful like Chapel paint
You hapless fakes should know I'm the master bate
After dates: my place, innate to take out wrappers straight rappin' great
Keep spitin' till my lips bleed
Bury you 6 feet, got your girl fist deep
Your shit's weak, Ripley says mines risky
I take the stick out her mouth, just to let my chick breath
This'll make you spend your rainy day savings
I radiate rabis and I'd maybe date Brady's wife
She's a Brazilian baby from the 80's
Maybe be my lady, spit crazy and amazing
Lately, I been blazing cause I'm sicker than the chicken pox
Hit you with a Sunny Liston shot when the whistle stops
You write simple plots, mine are outlandish
I got a gifted cock, girls say its outstanding, yes-
I'm moving forwards while you stay stuck in sleet
I got a bunch of needs, S.May cut the beat
I'll run this game even if you cuff my feet
Fans love the heat so viewers be like "fuck a beat"
I'm just a beast who will punch a G till his stomach bleeds
Gut check, tough set when your something's weak
Since puberty, weed has been a cash crop
Mad hops on the black top you work the snack shop
The definition of sloppy, ask Webster
Pay attention you copies, I roll the best herb
My brain is lifted, your plagiarism not fresher
Than me throwing 1 down as a catcher
Worship the wordsmith you're worthless and nervous
Surfing the surface with a surplus of servants
Look- I require your undivided attention
Around me don't mention, affection or prevention
Rapin' beats raw dog, like the cats in straw dogs
Hard bars, spit flame like Charzard
I smoke Ivysoar till my eyes are sore, buy some more
Smo
Fuck the rental house, I'm coming through to buy the whole block
No need your temper down, you know we 'bout to party non-stop
You try to rap but you chop, callin' fouls but you flop
If this is Famersville you're the pussy beggin' for crops
You a bottom feeder, Spongebob is your next door neighbor
Easy haters, save it for later, I'm your father Darth Vader
That's a joke invader Zim, I already run the world
No need to say it again, no need to say it again
You see I spit rhymes and dish dimes like my name's Steve Nash
You see I clip mine from the beanstalk, I don't spend no cash
I just watch that ass, as your bitch is cooking breakfast
I'm sexting her best friend, telling' me "wear no protection"
She molested my mind, went on the Maury show to prove it ain't mine
Smokin' blunts all the time, or maybe spliff bowls or papers
Bow to your creator, no time for the bullshit
I'm out I'll see you later, I'm the man like Slater
Getting' pussy and your mascot is the masterbaters
You mad cause I stained her, you a little bitch so you stayed there
I'm the dog trainer, better yet call me the Whisperer
She's suckin' on my dick, and I ain't kiss her
I'm a baller, stackin' money like Griffin off the Clippers
Your a weird mother fucker lookin' for dragons and wizards
Fag well we figured, no need to stop at the bank
I get my money delivered in the same truck as my dank

[Intro: Diddy]
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Trigga, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Trigga, let's go

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Stop, pose, what's that?
Bend it over quick, throw your butt back
Tuned in for the mill, where the bucks at?
She see me spend a couple mill like fuck that
She wanna ride on it like a bus pass
Give me smart brain and a dumb pack
Gon' poke it out, thumb tack
Back that ass up, I'ma front that
Knock it out the park, let these other niggas bunt that
Turn the music up, where the club at?
Throw a couple stacks, where the 1's at?
Shout to all the women that know they got that come back
Girl, you got that I can see it from the front back
She said "Damn, they be hatin', where the love at?"
I said "Damn that, you lookin' like you does that"
Hair up, damn, she done brought the fuckin' bun back
Niggas shady, damn, bring the sun back
Beat crazy, damn, bring the drums back
This yo city, nigga, damn, how I run that?
Forgot I was a singer, damn, bring the run back

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with you
Ay, check me out though, I'm just tryna chill with you
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with you
Che-Check me out
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with you
Ay, check me out though, I'm just tryna chill with you
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with youChe-check me out, um daddy

[Verse 2: Diddy & Trey Songz]
You say you work hard, where you work at?
Girl, I go hard, let me work that
Say you got drive, well reverse that
I'ma beat it up. I'ma, I'ma hurt that
Single momma, yeah yeah, I support that
I don't judge baby, I ain't tryna court that
I don't play baby, I ain't tryna sport that
Talkin' 'bout it's real when I know somebody bought that
My time money and you niggas can't afford that
Bad bitches in the studio where I record that
Right now and I'm finna pipe down
Once I'm done this verse shit, I'ma kill this pussy, I'ma hearse it
I'ma fool with it, super cool with it
While you snoozin', I got a booze in it
I took her panties and I put a pool in it
The flow stupid, it's so stupid

And I get deep up in that pussy, then I outro
Bad bitch and the miles low
Oh, that's your main chick? That's my side hoe
She a dime and she a dime, so we don't know
When I compare 'em it's like a Chevy, a Tahoe
Yo Trigga, where the hoes?

I got them guys jealous 'cause I'm gettin' dough
She said she never seen a ghost 'til she was in my Rolls
Lookey here, I'ma keep it real with you
Get it clear, I ain't tryna chill with you
Give her here so I can put the steel in ya
Now, shorty bust it open for a real nigga

Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Um daddy

[Intro]
This ain't even all my jewelry
This ain't even all my jewelry
Excuse me

[Chorus]
Please let me floss my jewelry
So much ice, I'll make your eye sight blurry
Jewelry, have on too much jewelry
Never too much, never too much, so much
Jewelry, this ain't even half my jewelry
It's getting kind of cold in here, I'm seri'
Jewelry, please let me rock my jewelry
Everybody starin' 'cause we're rockin' big jewelry (So Icey Entertainment)

[Verse 1]
Jewelry, people see me rock big jewelry (Brr)
My jewelry talks for me, baby girl, don't you hear it? (Wow)
Serious, this ain't even half my jewelry (Yeah)
Red diamond chain, my charm is on it's period
Fear it, so many VVs, that's very very slight flaws in my necklace
Put my dog on it
Put me on hard four seconds, tell my auntie to bring all my bracelets
New piece coming, it's gone hurt their faces, OJ flexing
With the blue and white Jacob, Jacob, how you think we got the boy a bank up
So Icey CEO is covered like make up, Gucci, uh

[Chorus]
Please let me floss my jewelry
So much ice, I'll make your eye sight blurry
Jewelry, have on too much jewelry
Never too much, never too much, so much
Jewelry, this ain't even half my jewelry
It's getting kind of cold in here, I'm seri'
Jewelry, please let me rock my jewelry
Everybody starin' 'cause we're rockin' big jewelry

[Verse Two]
Say, Gucci Mane please can I have it or wear it, don't touch it
Baby, look, but don't grab it, flash it, Kodak moment, boo, careful, gaurd it
Hope she treat it like its important, rolling, I'll rush you for tailor
Little shorty, homie, over there, he's holding down a Glock 40, party
Everybody in here balling, blinging, everybody's chain in here's swinging
Hanging, damn I wish I had nine pinkies, twinkies, popping pills
And rolling up stinkies, this corner over here
Ain't nothing but iced out gangsters', with iced out ears, chest, wrist and fingers'

[Bridge]
Fingers', why you think we holding our bangers', we're gangsters'
Why you think we're twisting our fingers'
Fingers', why you think we're holding our bangers', we're gangsters'
Why you think we're twisting our fingers', So Icey

[Chorus]
Please let me floss my jewelry
So much ice, I'll make your eye sight blurry

Everybody starin' 'cause we're rockin' big jewelry

[Verse Three]
Jewellery's brighter, Jacobs, mulers, my jewellers known to over do us
Florida's white diamonds and cutters', he's an arrogant motherfucker
If you swing this boy, you've got to hustle, cocaine's in the box
With the hammer and the muscle, three hundred thousand rubbers'
And the dresser, snitches', bitches, fakes and busters', ketchup diamonds
Yellow's mustard, got to rock jewellery box's, man
I've got a jewellery dresser, VPS rocks all in my bezzers', VPS rocks
All in her bank up, all black Jacob looks like a panther, when you're iced up
You can't talk to strangers, VPS rocks all in my fingers', I'm so iced out
I can't talk to strangers, So Icey

[Verse 1]
We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Bridge]
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

You ain't got no onions, got no peppers

Finna get a hot dog

All the home girls tried fuck me after
Gave me head and turned me to a conscience rapper
Um, I could tell you how the world begun 'em
Virgin Mary slutty sister's son
At birth I was meant to come and, uh
Take over the world and fornicate with girls and

The meanest genius, my style seamless, I'm dope as fuck (Fuck)
Release my thesis, a piece on demons who spoke of love (Love)
Openly cope with emotion, only the strong survive
Along with my personified dog and my bionic eyes (Bionic eyes)
Life a cartoon, turn it up, you probably heard of us
We murderers and you curious what the verdict was (Was)
Release me, please, or believe the evil is comin' for ya
It’s me and a hundred warriors armed with swords and we sorcerers
Singin' Gloria the morning that your abortion come (Woah)

Now that's what mutherfuckers that have to rewind on they tapedeck
Yah mean. Catch it if you can baby. Spellbound

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?
Forget about our mothers and our friends

[Chorus]
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Verse 2]
I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end

[Chorus]
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

[Outro]
I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's just me and my niggas
And my family
And people that care about me and my fans
Fuck all these other niggas

[Chorus]
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
They'll never take me alive
King Wizard

[Verse 1]
You love that, little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing 'bout him
What is hip-hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart, and they gave the kids insight
Yup, now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step, yet, yup

[Chorus]
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside

King Wizard

[Verse 2]
My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember, couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in
Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going, I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks, girl
Hold a nigga down all the time, girl
Whaddup?

[Chorus]
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?

[Chorus]
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside

I can never front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie
Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn

We don’t have time left to regret (Hold on)
It will take more than common sense (Hold on)
So stop your wondering, take a stand (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
One single smile, a helping hand (Hold on)
It's not that hard to be a friend (Hold on)
So don’t give up, stand till the end (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Bridge]
When it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don’t forget to hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
No it's not Friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks
Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but nevermind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game till I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
Pullin off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don't even trip though I don't need no company
Me, I'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid

[Chorus: JaVonté]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga what I compose be so potent
That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin'
I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Oh lady don't call the police
It's just the Average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix
Don't be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all midget macks swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never co-exist with my mommas oldest
Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write
Ink over my brain, Wha's up?!

[Chorus: JaVonté]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' off your favorites since I'm cursed
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
And the ass look like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers
Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck you could keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'mma keep it K-Dot
Kendrick everyday, JAY-Z didn't lie
Fucka!

[Chorus: JaVonté]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Hook]

This here's real man
Harsh but hard
If you can't take it
You damn sure can't take the weight

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Momma had to hustle cause my pop was jive
Momma had 1 son 2 jobs
What a woman! Come from where the women gotta work like men
So we ain't need dad we got money like him
No school clothes no child support
And next year I'll probably be up in a Robb Report
I'm important so is my clique I'm riding for them
God lead us not into dividing waters
Guide my daughter see that she walk a straight one

(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)

[Verse 3]
I got shot when I was 12
Lost my pop when I was 14
Shot again at 20 will I shake these old dreams
Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner
Now that's like raking up leaves in the winter
And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers
Shit
I'll take a bite out the onion like
Fuck it!
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And won't cry
(Hook)
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause

And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man and
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And straight level vodka's the potion, makes me spill my emotion and
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
Light up 'til the pain gone (Gone), all I hear is the same song (Song)
When the radio came on, fuck around and get based on (Bitch)
Do this shit 'til the day I die (Die), are you ready (Ready), are you ready? (No)
Terrified but my hand is steady (Steady), verified, get the camera ready (Click)
Carry my own weight, all these earthquakes don't wake
Me up from this deep sleep (Sleep), divin' into this cold lake (Brr)
Fuck a bitch 'til her toes shake (Shake), tellin' me I'm her soulmate (Mate)
Disguised emotion, no face, bullshit with that, no thanks (Uh-huh)
Dealin' with it since '08 (No), fucked around, now I'm done
And I heard you're supposed to race when you hear the sound of that gun (Blaow)
Now it's losin' all of its fun (Fun), spendin' days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinkin' logical (No), gettin' high, jump off the moon (Moon)
Looked into his soul, when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible (No), when the mind is so closed (Closed)
Came in for your money (Ha), then left with all of your hoes, ha

[Chorus]
Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind, start forgettin' what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since she left me here alone, whoa
You hurt so good, girl, your lovin' hurt so good

[Verse 2]
Uh
Love me, love me, that fentanyl, it numb me (Numb)
Beautiful, it get ugly, turn you into a junkie (What?)
Still searchin' for something (Who?), but I don't know what (What)
Dreaming about nothing, wake you up and then fuck (Fuck)
I love it when you get a little nasty (Uh-huh)
Hit it from the back, if you like that, wiggle them ass cheeks (Blaow)
Isn't that sweet? Same shit we did last week (Uh-huh)
'Fore all the cash, you might've stood up and would've walked past me (Bye)
Wake me up from this bad dream (Dream), put a match to this gasoline ('Line)
Every night you somebody different, got me thinkin' it's Halloween
Fucked up, can't feel myself, work hard, might kill myself
Exist through audio, but all my problems as real as hell
Trapped in this wishin' well, death creepin' like Splinter Cell
Gettin' high, blew my mind away, find the words, what I'm tryna say
...I'ma think of that later (Later)
When the world goes against you, you better get that paper (Paper)

[Chorus]
Life move fast but my baby keep it slow
Open up your mind, start forgettin' what you know, oh
Shit ain't been the same since she left me here alone, whoa
You hurt so good, girl, your lovin' hurt so good

[Outro]
You hurt so good
You hurt so good

[Verse 1]
When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth and saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out
When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again off the back of my hand and I know it sounds tragic

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
(I'm addicted to your love)
I'm addicted to your love

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm addicted, I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your
I-I-I-I'm addicted, I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your love

[Verse 2]
Now that your name pumps like a blood in my veins
It pulses through my body, igniting my mind, it's like MDMA
And that's okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm addicted, I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your
I-I-I-I'm addicted, I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your love

[Bridge]
I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me
When I hear your voice, something happens to me
And I have no choice
I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm willing to take this chance
I need to dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Your name’s like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm addicted, I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your
I-I-I-I'm addicted, I-I-I-I'm addicted
I-I-I-I'm addicted to your love

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Spirit of Marilyn callin' me, audibly
Bawling, she said that she would never leave, continued to torture me
Telling me to come with her, underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her, pills and some rum with her
Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her
Yeah I'm in the ghost, but I ain't doing stunts with her
I ain't trying to be that, haters wanna see that
But I got 'em aggy, 'cause I win the gold like Gabby

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Everybody stands, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Dear God, If you're here God
Make the fire disappear when they stare God
Take away my fear when they interfere God
Do you fear God? 'Cause I fear God
And in my backyard, that's a deer, God
And that's a horse ranch, and to my core fans
Keep reppin' me, do it 'til the death of me
'X' in the box, 'cause ain't nobody checkin' me

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
Oh, oh, oh...
She's just a girl, but she's on fire

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ugh! I'm the shit—turn your nose up
I threw some bad bitches on my tour bus
I do some bad bitches on my private jet
If them bitches ain't fucking, give them parachutes
Walked up to a redbone like I'm the shit
Told her, "Give me that pussy, and fuck my bitch"
Yeah, skate rebel, gun at my waist level
Bitch yellow, tape yellow, give you an H-A-L-O
I don't do pussy niggas but get the most pussy, nigga
I'm popping Percs, I'm sipping lean, smoking pot like cooking dinner
My homie T roll up my blunt, skinnier than Rex Ryan
I'm counting money, I'm smoking plants, call that shit "math and science"
Now suck dick, Trukfit, snapback on your dog ass
These niggas broke like Mr. Glass, they don't want none, Sister Act
It's Young Money, you bitch, you; my weed louder than pimp suits
Your bitch swallow my pimp juice, her pussy wetter than swim suits
Swish! Michael... Phelps, nigga, in your ho
Coupe the color of YooHoo; rude boy—free Buju
Fuck wrong with these fuck niggas? I been balling since '98
Fuck y'all I'd rather skate, shoot you up in your database
I fell in love with drop-tops, I fell in love with shotguns
Our guns bigger than cop guns; y'all ain't spitting, dry tongue
I like wet pussy, she like hard dick, hard head make her soft fast
Tatted up from head to toe, guess you can call me a mark-man
Wayne soaring, all my whores is whoring
All you rappers is boring, Trukfit hat and some Jordans, ugh!

Clips hanging, no curfew
Fuck you and who birthed you

Birdman Jr.: y'all birdfood

She opened her mouth: water fountain
When I'm on the scene I'm on that lean
Bitch, I'm drowsy
Man, I'm so high I don't know what I'm laughing about
I got bars, nigga and it's happy hour!

["Hook"]
Ridin' round with them choppas, not them ninas
Ridin' with a bitch named Molly and she on Molly - ha!
Bitch I put my foot in your ass: karate
Man these niggas can't see me like a diary

[Verse 2]
Smoke that weed, let's get irie
Nina shut up, that bitch got a silence
Top of the gun there is a scope
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!
TRUKFIT my bitch up, Tunechi leave big nuts
I'm getting my dick sucked
I blow weed like it's dust!
Spacehead: love pussy, hate feds
Just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs
I'm a made nigga: Makaveli
That Mack-11: necessary
I'm a hard head: I pop the cherry
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry
They say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary
I'm the motherfuckin resolution like the 1st of January
My ride cold and my bitch hot
I'm tired as hell but my dick not
I don't gas no bitch, no pit-stop
Smoke Barney and Baby Bop!
Y'all niggas act like lady cops
My niggas smoke like coffee shops

Small feet, but I kick your ass

Eat that pussy like caviar

Step off in that motherfucker fresher than some Certs
Uuh! Who the fuck is Stevie J?
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Just make sure my pillow's fluffed
Hit a nigga with a million shots

Good weed, we pass around
Money talks: mine got a nasty mouth
It's Young Money, Cash Money
Til the motherfuckin day I'm Cashin Out!
Tunechi!

Riding round with them choppas, not them ninas
Your bitch wanna come over here where the grass is greener
And if you passing that weed, I'm the wide receiver
@LilTunechi, follow the leader Bitch!

[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know I've been talkin shit for a generation now
'Bout that time for me to kick my feet up
Y'know? Move on to other endeavors
Who's ready to take the torch?
Somebody? Anybody?
Haven't I taught you everything?

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
When this shit dropped, I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
Uh, I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I'm gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home
God damn, L-Lord have mercy
Please God, don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of Skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz-in'
Ya borin’, I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not askin', my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger

Uh, bitch I’m not old news, I’m more like gold shoes

She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you tryna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe, that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show

[Verse 1]
Hammer on the dresser, work on the stove
I'm sitting on the counter blowing purp out my nose
Red bone naked, in the bed flexin'
I say bitch I ain't impressed you must've got the wrong impression
I ain't with the BS, I'm flyer than PF
Man, we living in hell like a deep breath
Real niggas with real money, real bitches with fake asses
If she don't wanna fuck I get on my skateboard and I skate passed her
Money on the table, guns on the table
Bitch I'm on that syrup tell that ho leggo my Eggo
And my girlfriend is a choppa, I finger fuck that ho
Hello I am Tunechi: you had me at hello
Drop top Maybach, clean like Ajax

We got that work so come and get if we dont know you, you pay tax
I put a hole in your apple what that is apple jacks, uh
Pussy nigga I'll murder you then dance at your funeral
Blood I'll have a nigga drinking his own blood communion
Wake up like Bone Thugs I'll call your bluff pick the phone up
Her titties fake but they look real cubic: zirconia's
Run up in your house spare the kids and kill the grown ups
Your bitch call me when she hot: Krispy Kreme donuts
Shoutout to my new hoes, shoutout to my old hoes
I still wear that ass out like a wardrobe
Bitch, what they gonna say?
Still eating rappers on my fucking lunch break
Bad yellow bitch with a tongue like a snake
I let her suck my dick then I fuck her to some Drake

[Hook]
And then I let that kush burn let that kush burn
Yeah I let that kush burn
Smoking gasoline bitch
The booth on fire I'm in here getting higher
Young Money bitch we at the top like barbwire

[Verse 2]
Money on my mind I ain't thinking bout no bitch
I'm talking bout that scratch like my muhfuckin throat itch
Stop stuntin if you ballin buy your bitch somethin'
Stayed on the same team like Tim Duncan
Shit get real if ya scared go to catholic school
And if we want it straight jacket like a padded room
Shoot your ass 100 times and stand over you
Lil' Tunechi so fly I got arachnophobia
Burn bitch, AK in my firm grip
Leap if you feeling like Kermit, sermons
Preach reach and I smoke your ass like Cheech
I be faded like bleach, double barrel: Siamese
I like my swisher obese, fuck that bitch like police
Fuck these haters with no grease, you get chin checked: goatee
Money talks bitch and mine talks like Robin Leach
That lean got me slow as Lisa Turtle ask Screech
Bank card heavy, my wallet like a barbell
My girl got a fat cat, I call that shit Garfield
We'll bring the O.K. Corral to your doorbell
We pull triggers not coattails, I make lump sums: oatmeal
I'm stuntin', getting new money
Trukfit money Mountain Dew money, tell em

In the words of my nigga BP I'll hit a bitch with a car bomb BOOM

[Verse 1: Lil Wanye]
Gangsta Grillz ya bastards!
There's a couple married bitches in the building: fucked them!
I get that mouth I get that pussy:...The End
I see you niggas got no life.. Sixth Sense
She said she wanna fuck my brains out
But she gon have to suck this dick first!
Preach! Fucking right I'm geeked
She sat on my dick, she sat on my face
I told that bitch she got good seats
Man, these niggas softer than fleece
Shoot these niggas in they obliques
You talkin' shit, I knock you out, now go ahead and talk in your sleep
Bitch you know the motto!
It's Young Money over hoes
Lying to these bitches, they call my dick Pinnochio
Gettin' to the money, now the money getting to me
She say my vert-dick is hung like a jury
I'm on the track: DOA
Some of these niggas be DEA
Money tall: NBA
Broke niggas: SMH
Hit it like Canseco
While she say "you No way Jose!"
I got an O of that white
What you call that? OKKK!
Every night I go hard
She blow me like Boston George
She like it in her ass, mouth and pussy: 3 car garage!
These niggas is false alarms
They don't mean no fuckin harm
Hey baby let's make a porn!
Ba-bum! Devil horns
You know that I ain't got no ceilings!
The money changed me, I'm making chameleons
Only God can judge me, can't appeal it
In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Amen! Tell them alphabet boys it's a "G" thing
I've got a street sweeper.. do you need your street cleaned?
Young Money bitch! We colder than a ski team
Red beam, if you scared, muthafucka go to church!
Preach! Security breach
I'm on that grass harder than cleats
I'm on that gas, and y'all on E
Nigga my cash out of your reach
I run shit like the reverend
She get on her knees and pray to this dick
Then swallow all of them blessings
Church!

[Verse 2: Boo]
Just a way of life
Bought my mama a crib
Bought my daddy a car
Let them both meet Tune
Now they think I'm a star
Damn I love this life wouldn't trade it for nothing
Most theses rappers is falling cause they ain't standing for nothing
I smoke that loud so I don't hear haters talking
Plus these bitches be stalking trying look for a fortune
In the Chi we say church when the pussy gets purchase
Got a bitch so bad she make a player get nervous
Now good ain't good enough and my hood is hood as fuck
I be praying for them shorties trynna get their dollars up
Swag so dope you probably think I'm dealing
And I only give head if baby girl swallow children
Boo ain't got a ghost and bitches still be catch the holy ghost
She say she want to get high I hit her with that overdose
Pimpin' so cold put that on my overcoat
Only ride foreign
We don't do 100 spokes
When broke niggas talk that's 100 jokes
Ha Laughing at you fuck boys
Skate gear I'm a truck boy
On my truck right I don't give a fuck boy

[Verse 1]
These streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb
Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm kurupted!

I'm kurupted!

[Verse 2]
Gimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees
Verbically useless, oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you from many nooses
Been the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys thats looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops
Lazer-in 'em on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch you's a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god
Count your lyrics in a jar, I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do
Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
I'm kurupted!
I'm kurupted!

[Verse 3]
(Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)
Blunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit
Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P
Complete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- Slaughter
House is full of Joey, Joells and Royces for ya'
Live from the area code of Three-One-Oh
Laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos
Three six-fo's, One bottle of Goose, I'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot
I'm Kurupted!

[Outro]
See a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends
West Coast legends, Young Gotti

I black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these Emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. Kurupted

[Intro]
Alright, let’s put it in perspective
See 1, 1 makes you realize
2, that’s when the game became ours
See 3, that’s when we showed you the future
This here, it’s for the sport
Some of you niggas mad the sport normally happens to be skateboarding
But that gives us 4 wheels to roll over you niggas
D4, and dedication!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She’s so sophisticated
She'll catch a nigga nut and then refrigerate it
I wear a rubber and we fuck 'til we dehydrated
I pull it out bust on her face and call her cry baby
I kiss her neck, I kiss her stomach, then I kiss that pussy
And then I eat it from the back, but I don’t do crack
And then I get this monster hard and ask her where to put it
She tell me, Tunechi, hit it raw, I tell her bitch you crazy
Don’t want no HIV, don’t need that Honeymoon In Vegas
It’s YMCMB the fucking alpha and omega
The presidential double R, call that Ronald Reagan
I fuck your bitch, we come together call that congregating
I be balling on these niggas, Sports Illustrated
Tough in the streets, but you in the court with a statement
Ain’t that a bitch and I kill everybody but the babies
Give that bitch nigga the blues 'til he fucking navy
Yeah, man I be riding round with that yopper
I pop a nigga like 

[clap noise]
All you hoes get topless, suck this dick 'til it’s spotless
Too many hoes: I got options
I ain’t never tripping, you could have the bitch
And I’ma send her back with her pussy lips, looking just like camel lips
You fucking with some real nigga, blow your fucking head off
They say life is a bitch, I hope that bitch a redbone
All I know is get money, bitch ain’t getting shit from me
Fuck a six pack, six bullets give you six stomachs
Tell her how that pussy tastes, she been eating pineapples
Throw her back like a quarterback, hit that ass like a linebacker
Put that pussy on me, we caught up in the moment
AK with a hair trigger, nigga don’t make me comb it
This like a full time job not to kill niggas
Some of my homeboys' job is to kill niggas
Yeah, cause I’m still on probation
Write your name on a bullet that’s a Dedication, 4

[Outro: Birdman]
Y'all ready?
Yeah, welcome to Dedication 4
I be Stunna Man
Priceless lifestyle, high life
YMCMB business
Truk your girl, nigga
22 years full time grind
Mula, best ever, one hunnit

[Intro]
Tunechi, Drama, same time
Can only be Dedication

[Verse 1]
Turn the music up in my headphones
Uh, I'm wildin' out on my skateboard, she ridin' dick like race cars
My blunt longer than spacebars, I'm gettin' higher than quasars
I beg your pardon, I egg your noggin, got Nin up in my glove compartment
I'm so short, yellow bus retarded, my flow hard, these niggas carpet
I'm Tunechi, I do me, smoke doobies, tote uzis
I make that bitch cum 'til she come to a conclusion
I'm ill as an illusion, I got B's like a student
Bitch I am not a human and this dick is therapeutic
She say, "Tunechi give that dick to me, smoother than a symphony"
Two bad bitches at the same time, symmetry
Murder you no sympathy, got medal like olympians
Tee put the weed in the blunt like a parentheses
Fuck y'all niggas I'm gettin' me, is you kiddin' me?
That big booty, them pretty feet
Them swishas' sweets with that purp
Church - with the priest
That red-boned get licked to sleep, she'll wake up and get dicked to sleep
Pickled meat, freaky deak, I test these niggas with a cheat-sheet
Her clit look like a jelly bean, I'm on that promethazine
Blow your ass to smithereens, kush strong like Mr. Clean
I'm a king I have a dream, money flippin' trampoline
Money flippin' balance beam, fresher than the prince, the king, and the queen
That's your bitch if my celly ring and I kiss her belly ring
Put that dick up in her spleen, I shine like afro sheen
And I eat pussy, she suck dick at the same damn time
That's a 69, then pass her to my slime
I'm skatin' and rappin' at the same damn time
I said I might retire, but y'all know I be high
I did that time, I paid that fine
Fuck around and go to jail for the same damn crime
For the same damn crime? Na, murder this time
Potato on the end of the barrel, french fries
I'm rich bitch, Trukfit in Macy's!
And you pussy niggas hatin' like a racist
Totally dude, I'm white boy wasted
She can't wait to take her drawers off like braces
Yeah, Scooby got another one, smokin' on that bubble gum
Two dutch bitches, double dutch, I'm the shit, bubble guts
Nigga get your duffles up, don't know if it's love or lust
Tell that ho to suck it up, she got lips like rubber ducks
That pussy whack, I'm one and done, trouble some I'm troublesome
Got two bitches off twitter, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum
Single ladies, double cups, I'm tighter than a cummerbund
Smokin' on that strong, my blunt a fucking muscle punk
Tunechi

[Outro]
And I'm gone
Hahaha, yeah, Dedication 4 ho
Future fuck with me!

[Intro: Jae Millz]
Don't make my slimes go stupid, go stupid

That A-K like Aretha, it's gon' sing, and you gon' respect me
You niggas just good at playin gangster roles—Joe Pesh-ky
That's your girl, but it's my world, so she ride me like a cruise ship
My flight land, I check in my suite, she bust it open like a new gift
We ain't from no water fighting, but you will get Super soaked
My goons will catch you in that Ghost and turn your ass into a ghost
My flow super stupid, Forrest Gump, that's retarded-dumb
Kush cloud my lungs and my clique bang
Keep the change, Rich Gang—Millzy!

Steamrolling whatever I see, ugh
Despicable me
I’m having a bad, bad, day
If you take it personal that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see, ugh
Despicable me

[Verse 1]
Why ask "Why?", better yet, "Why not?"
Why are you marking X on that spot?
Why use a blow torch, isn’t that hot?
Why use a chainsaw, is that all you got?
Why do you like seeing people in shock?
But my question to you is "Why not?"
Why go to the bank and stand in line?
Just use a freeze gun, it saves me time

[Hook]
I'm having a bad, bad, day

Steamrolling whatever I see, huh
Despicable me

Why ask "Why?" when this is art?
Why parallel when I could just park?
Why does Vector think that he’s smart?
And does his dad know I know his part?
Why did I have to live with my mom?
Why do you think that I should be calm?
Why want the moon, the World's in my palm?
Is it crazy you think I’ve gone?

[Hook]
I'm having a bad, bad, day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see, huh
Despicable me
I’m having a bad, bad, day

[Instrumental Outro]
A short time ago
In a galaxy closely, closely near (Is it closely?)
(Yeah, it's closely, just keep the evil voice!)
Oh, oh, I'm sorry for party rocking
I've been sipping on that whiskey all day (Just read it!)
Two men emerged out of the muck
April 1, 2007, April Fools' Day
It marked the birth of a new sound, Party Rock
And what we do is rock the beat!
(It's going down!)
'Cause we LMFAO, rock the beat and rock the show
Move your feet onto the floor, start to freak and drink some more

Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
If you came to party put your motherfucking hands up!
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
If you came to party put your motherfucking hands up!
Girls that don't do girls, that's that shit I don't like
Dick in her mouth, bitch eatin' her out, that's that shit my girl like
I'm layin' back with my feet up, bad bitch: D cups
All I had was one molly, she took half: prenup
I just licked my thumb and thumbed through that pussy like a catalog
All my niggas wanna fuck, and she gon let us like a salad bar
Yeah that's right, real shit, murderer, I kill kill
Cash Money, cash cow that never cry over spilled milk
I'm way high on the highway, my girl call to get my lies straight
That machine gun go "brrrrr" like I got that bitch on vibrate
Niggas think they hot, I cut off the hand they fan with
Call me DMX, cause I keep me a bad bitch
T called some of them hoes up, Marley G roll up
I'm gettin' bread like cold cuts, she suck dick till her nose run, yeah

A rich nigga that that shit they don't like
All you niggas pussies, none of you pussies tight
Gettin' head while I drive make me run lights
These hoes wanna ride my dick you gotta hitchhike
No lie, I'm fuckin' bitches and gettin' paid
She suck my dick for 60 seconds and swallow all my Minute Maid
No lie, I'm gettin' paid and fuckin' bitches
The Feds on me, gotta switch plates
In the streets we call that washin' dishes
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on the nine-milly
T-roll my blunt long as a lifespan then I kill it
Eatin' pussy, tongue kissin' and all that
She ridin' a nigga so fast, my dick feel like it's been carjacked
Two guns drawn, art class, what that is that's y'all ass
Mo' money, mo' money, we gettin' mow like tall grass
We are not one and the same
Blood is the gang, it run in my veins
I bagged your bitch then fuck her
Now come get your bitch from baggage claim, nigga!
Dr. Carter, fuck her harder
All my homies bald, nigga
And guess what? I'm the barber
I'm too high; if I come down my fat pocket's my shock absorber
Like Hank Gathers I'mma die a baller, you flamin' faggots put him out with water
Ugh! See that's that shit I don't like
Knock off your whole left side, now you all right
Yeah white diamonds, Vanilla Ice
My nigga Tunechi, yeah that nigga nice
Dedication 4, ho
(My nigga Tunechi, yeah that nigga nice)
CB fuck with me!

[Chorus: Lil Mouse]
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm rollin', all my niggas rollin'
Keep that fucking red bandana: Hulk Hogan
I'm cuttin' up like scissors, coming down hard like blizzards
I'm gettin head while givin' head, that's a head-on collision
I'm on a pain pill, I keep this shit trill
These niggas ain't for real, like a fire drill
Yo ho on my back like a fuckin' fifth wheel
That bitch make her pussy open and close like fish gils
I put all my niggas on, but some of those niggas gone
Them niggas callin' my phone, leave me alone
I'm lightin' up that strong, then pass it to my bro
Numbers don't lie: except 5-0
Different colored TruckFit shirts, you niggas put on yo skirts
If I die off these percs, put a bad bitch in my hearse
My hoes lift up they shirts, I'm high as Captain Kirk
If we run out of work, we Rob, like Bert
Yeeeeaaaaaaaah Niggaaaa!

[Chorus: Lil Mouse]
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Verse 2: Lil Mouse]
Corlay RIP him, Darnell RIP him
If you disrespect them, then you gone meet them
My niggas rollin 4-seata; that bitch going, she a eater
She was a good girl, I turned her to a eater
Hit squad move burbons, young nigga on freeband
.30 clip and them hollow tips make him do the running man
That Glock 40 I’m thumpin man; I'm rolling with my hitters
I'll send my hitters out to go get you
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Niggas talking shit in the club, he better watch his self
Melly got the .30 on his hip, he gone need some help
I'm a gangster, nigga, and I could do this shit my fucking self
Pistol to his melon; (and what else?) it ain't gone be nothing left

[Chorus: Lil Mouse]
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Running round with my gangstas, running up on these yellow hoes
Everybody wanna fuck my bitch, her pussy lips like heaven doors
It's pussy, money, and kush, skateboards and shroom
These niggas think they the shit, these niggas perfume
Hollygrove, so Hollygrove, all I know is Hollygrove
I'm sick with it, I've been diagnosed
We don't cut the coke, that's Diet Coke
These niggas broke, I'm paid in full
Blood gang, Red Bull
My tongue like a surfboard, and her pussy like a wave pool
Tunechi

[Chorus: Lil Mouse]
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
09, we tote; my niggas ain't no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don't get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

[Verse 1: Flow]
Ah.. Pop another percocet
My flow is retarded, I think I got a birth defect
Highway to heaven Bow! Where the fuck the chauffeur at?
These niggas softer than the pillows on my sofa set
I'm fighting myself cause I don't see no competition
I don't write, I draw that pistol make your face a composition
So please walk away before we stomp your ass
Everyday is halloween and you can get your pumpkin smashed
The ones you think your friends is really your haters
So just do me a favor.. and don't do me no favor
All I need is a blunt and a cup of purple
I put this together, I could've been a construction worker
Niggas looking funny, well I'm just getting blunted
And everybody's wondering if I'm really with Young Money
Well is a pig's pussy pork? Do bears be shittin'
In the woods and wipe they ass with a rabbit when they finish?
Turn my swagger super mean but my bitches bad too
And my flag bright red but Lortab blue, Oop!
Isn't it ironic I tell Tunechi pass the chronic
Purple syrup, yellow Fanta, you can call it Magic Johnson

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Gone off the shrooms, I'm stoned like tomb
Bitch, I do what I do like the groom
Looking death in the eyes, kissing fear on the lips
I'm so faded my nigga I'm 'bout to disappear in this bitch
Like poof, there go my roof
Pow, there go my hammer
Come around here stuntin', get jacked like O'Lantern
Two times for them haters, head shots for them snitches
If the best things in life are free then why the fuck we pay attention?
Uh, pockets on nine-months, I go dumber than a dunce
Too many pills, too many blunts
Two bitches named such-and-such
It's Young Money we out chea, we turnt up 'bout that life
My pockets fat like Jack Black - If I go broke, I'mma jack whites
My bitch bad as fuck nigga, my goons 'bout that trigger play
Murk one of these soft niggas, now I'm in court for a pillow case
This is the magic show but Tune ain't no trick ho
Fuck niggas no Chris Stokes, it's me, Flow, D4
Fishtailing out the parking lot like salmon
She swallowed all my kids, bitch we could of had a family
The way I make the purp disappear, straight vanish
Smoke fire, spit fire
Puff the magic dragon
Tunechi!
D4 ho
Future fuck with me!

[Verse 1]
I'm looking up at heaven, hoping my niggas made it
While I'm tryna get them demons, out of my demonstration
I'm like fucking right I'm flexing on these pancake ass niggas
These niggas must be nuts, I castrate these niggas (pause)
Then she stuck out her tongue
Well since you act like a dog I'mma fuck you like one
I got this Tec in my draws, and I murder for fun
Man all these niggas the same, it's like we watching re-runs
And I am salt in the wound, I am soap in ya eye
These bitches thinkin' they fly, I tell em' roaches can fly
Even at my low bitch I'm high, I'm tryna stay focused I'm fine
But if I crack one of these niggas like a glow stick he shine
But it's Trukfit: skate or die, them bitches wasting my time
And when they ask me where I'm from I say the Great State of Mind
OK that loud got me stanky, that lean got me cranky
They tell me think it over over and I end up over-thinking, agh!

[Bridge]
Cause I don't know how fake feel nigga
Cause all my life I've been a real nigga
Yeah all my life I've been a real nigga
Kidnap yo wife, fuck her and still kill her
Yeah and I don't wanna take pills nigga
But it's either that or take chances nigga
Run up on you, click-clack: pay yo taxes nigga
We bout that action, these niggas action figures

[Verse 2]
Uhh, Young Money on another level
I like her pussy tighter than my fucking schedule
Man I love hitting yo bitch, like a Lucky Seven
I'm running this shit, you niggas running errands
Money ain't shit to me
I smoke all these niggas, call it Niggatine
Yellowbone pussy, uh lemon squeeze
I ain't too proud to beg, so nigga please
Fake ass, bitch ass
You faker than yo bitch ass
Weed good, bitch bad
Fat mouth, slim chance
I see you niggas hatin', with ya hatin' ass
I'm just lightin' up, like laser tag
Chopper clips is too long, send you back to where you came from
Yeah, pussy niggas get banged up, I wish you would give a name up
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
They find yo motherfucking body in the woods nigga
We on that good nigga, we ain't no G.O.O.D niggas
You niggas stand under me, understood nigga?
D4

[Intro]
Yup, yup
I look up
Cause I can't look down on you bitch niggas no mo, man
If that casket ain't 24 karat gold when I die
Then I ain't made enough fucking money man and that's real talk
God

[Verse]
This my roll weed time
Don't turn it into dead in the street time
Her legs do the peace sign
Know the hood so well don't need street signs
Young rich and iconic
Big titties I'm signin'
Burnin' benjies and chronic
Big white smoke clouds every time I talk, does it look like I'm in a comic?
Everything I rock I designed it, realer nigga, won't find it
Okay, I be stackin' that cheddar, bet that shit won't expire
Got me ballin' so hard, I need me Jerry Maguire
I made a mil before twenty-five, man and I ain't even no lie
Bitch I ain't sayin' that shit to brag neither, I'm sayin' that to inspire
I'm like, damn boy, fuck you sayin' boy?
Hatin' on me, knowin' that you is a fanboy
When I'm around you call me Cuz like we fam boy?
Rappin' like me lets me know that I'm the man boy
Okay, Hennessy and Bombay is a real nigga entree
I gave her my grande, my food is picante
My girls is Beyonce, your boyfriend beyond gay
I seen him hang with Deandre and they was lookin' like prom dates
One time for my hood 'til I go in the ground
I'm throwin' it up cause they holdin' me down
I'm perverted as fuck, got a pole in the house
Got your girl and your girl and they hoein' it out
But you standin' outside cause no hoes is allowed
If you work like I work, you would throw in the towel
Once you get in this life, man, there's no comin' out
And haters look at me like snow in the south
Surprise nigga
Man fuck it, I'm on, you off and I hope you die, nigga
Why you alive nigga?
I'm stackin' dough cause my momma addicted to spas
Yeah I'm the one that these hatin' niggas despise
You better take off your fuckin' disguise, nigga
Bitch-made is in your eyes nigga
Lies nigga
Shut the fuck up, everything'll be fine
Cause this my roll weed time

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearin' fox furs, rockin' oxfords
Eatin' oxtails, sippin' Cockspur
Silly motherfuckers lookin' awkward
So much dick ridin' that my cock hurt
(Pause), we runnin' clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3 come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your coucou
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it play games like soccer when we kick it
Get it?

Hold it down, beat it like a bully

Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover

Do it like I do it

[Hook: Dre]
Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio

Thats what they be yelling
Im a pimp by blood, not relation, ya'll be chasin and i replace em
You dont need me for nothing else my nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
When the remy's in the system
Ain't no telling on the spot where ima kiss em
Thats why they be yelling
Im a damu blood, my relation, affiliation, soo woo nation
And since day one ive looked forward to 3, 4, 5 bitches in my porsche coupe
Yeah i be on that ass like a horses shoe
And if her religion is true we bout to visit the moon
Is you coming?

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they telling me

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When the remy's in the system
Ain't no question ima fuck em and diss em
Leave em never missing

[Verse 1]
Off top nigga, don't fucking play
Stacks On Deck boys, bitch yeah we in this thing
Money Gang, tat that shit up off my armored ring
On my chain, fifty diamonds standing money bling
Ching, ching, I done cashed out like a jackpot
And I'm big dog flexing like Sandlot
In my hood, man we stack them shit's by four blocks
I'm turned up, and we get them by the C-knots
C notes, cut throat with my campaign
Fifty racks make it rain, make it hurricane
Young Dre, I go hard and I spit flame
Off top, money boy's in this thing

[Verse 2]
Pull up to the party, it's time to have some fun
Standing on the couch, and I'm throwing funds
Stripper bitches on me, it ain't nothing though
Do this every fucking night, all across the globe
I hop up on the jet, it's time to cash out
I hop up in that Vet', it's time to smash out
My homeboy copped a Ferrari, so I copped a jet
I threw thirty racks on my fucking neck
I pull up to the trap, to finesse
I call my young nigga and he hit the plug
Now we in the trap, pulled up off mud
I pulled up in that Lambo', skurt' scrub

[Outro]
We in this thing
Yeah we in this thing
We in this thing
Yeah we in this thing
We in this thing, yeah we in this thing
In this thing, yeah we in this thing
In this thing, yeah we in this thing
Yeah we in this thing, me and my nigga's in this thing

[Verse 1]
Through the fire, smoke, and broken rubble
Walks the secret life, bullet-proof and bulging muscle
Death-defying, highest flying over trouble
Can you please come and help us out our hopeless struggles?
Sympathy is wearing off and dying out
In the face of all these enemies and crying out
Losing all this energy from finding out
The world is filled with ills, ever so close to timing out

[Hook]
Where, are those heroes?
Where, are those super-heroes?

[Verse 2]
Pondering, that super-villain's got a point
Told the captain on the roof while they was smoking joints
Flicked the ashes down into the street below
Looked up, said he hate the city now, even though
He swore that he'd protect it when he landed
Their perspective's now changed, all pretty much abandoned
The captain spray cologne around and said he understand it
It's getting hard to separate the saints from the satanic

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Last remarks, they did it to themselves
I killed off heaven, now I live in hell
So complicit in their own non-survival
Told them that they biggest rival is inside you
I do possess the power to revive you
But if I did that, I'd just have to fight you
Cause you truly are the hero and the villain
The world stood froze, hearing a truth so chilling
Reporters stopped filming, somebody shouted, "Kill him!"
He looked back in disgust and flew up through the ceiling
Busted through the roof and kicked over the building
Before it hit the ground, a younger hero flew around
And put it on his shoulders, said you're naive now
But believe, you'll believe me when you're older
Every asteroid you stop and bomb you fly up into space
You ain't saving them from danger, you're keeping danger safe

[Hook]

[Outro]

In my hands, all the peace and all the glory
In my hands
In my hands
In my hands, all the peace and all the glory
In my hands
In my hands

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Welcome to Hell's paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven, 11, or a pair of eyes
As I'm looking at her smearing eyes
She yelling, "Take them glasses off, yo eyes are the only things that's not lying"
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying
I tell her I feel the same
She tell me, "Nigga, quit playing, you the only one that's not crying"
You said you wasn't on no steal your man shit
If I broke it off now we won't be on some friend shit
Man, what goes around comes around, that ceiling fan shit
I broke the levy to your eyes that I don't give a damn, shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And time after time, it's the same old shit
Think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes
And I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late
'Cause two can't be in first place

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Well, wake up then, shit, call your ex and make up then
What was no strings attached got tangled when
Fun stopped being fun, and feelings tried to finagle in
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one
You need a good guy and I'm already not one
She said, "We lost a kid already, I'm already not that young
My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just tryna have fun"
Shit's way different from us first chilling
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
Is there a warranty for love to return or fix it? (Hmm)
She said you good either way
When it was her last night, nigga, and me today
You the man, huh? Getting all the TNA
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?
Huh, and so on and so on (Hmm)
And the shit just always goes on
Nothing about us feeling right
But she'll be back before the end of the night, saying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, and time after time, it's the same old shit (Same old shit, yeah)
Think it might be too late (Oh, no), for me to learn from my mistakes
And I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late
'Cause two can't be in first place

[Outro: Chris Brown]
I love, I love her

[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, G.O.O.D

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Seems life's never at a standstill, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex-girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm, I swear I feel it coming

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, J. Cole]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Intro]
Yeah
Is this what they want?
Yeah
This what they want, nigga (You see it)
Uh, God
Finally Famous
Cartel, Comission, whatever
G.O.O.D
Anything but broke, nigga

[Verse]
My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I f-fill every urn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion (Whoa)
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be votin'
So when you step inside my office, treat that bitch like it's the Oval
El presidente, lord, sensei
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting risqué
Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since 'Ye, yeah
Well, this the life that I live
Collecting everything overdue for all the work that I overdid
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah, kid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
'Cause when you come from the bottom, man, it's so hard to just get a glimpse
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic
And show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Okay, como me llamo
She say, "Ingles, no hablo," man, unless it's eat me out, though
Benihana, my McDonald, all black leather jackets
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do'
'Cause I got too many real ma'fuckers I ride for, die for, uh
Straight out the metropolitan
My city need a hero, so I treat it like Metropolis
And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name
Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't save
But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man, we ain't make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man, we was tryna get away, man, we was tryna get ordained
And damn, tomorrow never seemed so close
And life ain't what it seem no mo'
'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suin' me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settlin', life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement
Like damn

[Outro]
Shit (Boy)
Can't a young nigga live, man?
We done worked too hard
Yup (G.O.O.D.)
Finally Famous
Lil' hoes
We ain't goin' broke, nigga

[Intro: Big Sean]
Young Chop on the beat
Yup.. money, money, money

[Chorus 1: Big Sean & James Fantleroy]
I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Chorus 2: Big Sean]
Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up) tell these fuck boys they gotta pay
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I woke up, woke up, thank God I woke up (yeah)
Wifey at home but I’m living life like we broke up (yeah)
You hit the hood and post up, I’m gon’ get it ‘til I’m filthy rich
My hands dirty, my gross up (gross), my money doing the toe touch
That’s stretched out, ‘til I’m in the back, stretched out, drinkin' Ace
‘cause I’m decked out, whole hood with me; need a guest house, yea a guest house
Lately, I been getting like mo’ ass and less mouth
‘Cause when they see that whip (skrrt), they start to think about kids
Man, when they see this crib, they gon’ start to think about cribs
Been dealt with real life too long, now it’s time to live
Respect out the D (boi), hardly had a pot to pee in
Now I’m at the Coliseum, lil’ niggas gotta see him
Tryna be him, show you how to follow vision, real nigga
Politician, bad bitch, swallowtician, gotta get it
Yea (yea), last night I lost all that
I’ma wake my ass up, get it all back, thank God

[Chorus 1: Big Sean & James Fantleroy]
I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Chorus 2: Big Sean]
Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up) tell these fuck boys they gotta pay
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)

[Verse 2: Sayitaintone]
Now I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, livin' like I won’t see the night
A real playa like Pinky, when I’m in the game, I TD
And I’m all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, that’s 3D
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high
Last week, I was so high, I felt drunk
I got a bitch so bad, I gotta hit from the front
I fuck Kim K hoes, that’s Ye ‘Ye tone, smoking weed, that’s reggaeton
Get it next to free, that’s AJ tone, what’s my name
What’s my name bitch? Sayitaintone, what she saying? Sayitaintone
Who they paying? Sayitaintone, fuck sleep that take too long!

[Chorus 1: Big Sean & James Fantleroy]
I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Chorus 2: Big Sean]
Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up) tell these fuck boys they gotta pay
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)

[Chorus 1: Big Sean & James Fantleroy]
I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Birdge: Mike Posner]
I woke up this morning
Looking at the city that raised me
I can get it all now
And go get everything they never gave me

[Verse 3: Earlly Mac]
Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake
I’ma do dessert first, I don’t even gotta wait
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray
By the way, my jewelry appraised, it’s a couple K
On the lake, I’m out of the state, at my hideaway
Like Bruce Wayne, I’m saving the day, and I’m getting bank
I’m foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I pro up
Ok it’s Earlly Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold
I’m foolay

[Chorus 1: Big Sean & James Fantleroy]
I woke up - boy it’s time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up - feelin' like the mothafuckin’ realest
Living but it’s time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up
Bitch, yeah, ha

Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
All blue, all red, smothers every corner
Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia
Good 'ol California, killa' California
Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
I'm in the booth zoning
Like 28 grams, of the good yams
Fiends line up in the morning
I'm cloning, greatness
My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan
I could burn through some braces
If I had 'em
This is the return of the dragon
I'm not talking about, Bruce Lee
I'm talking about, true heat
And it look like you got cold feet
Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name
(laughing)

Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor
Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare
Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air
Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's
No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right
Like a freeway exit, I hope you get the message
Before your T-Mobile lose service
And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you
Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch
Don't fuck with me

I'm a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka' inside out like
Daddy mac, mac, daddy's back with a brand new bag
And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols
Students please get out your pencils
I'm about to break down the principles of the game
Don't complain because, it could be much worse
Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
You playing with that you playing with fire
Burn (echoes)

Straight from the belly of the beast
Break it to the police
Said he put it on me
I'm a ride til my wheels fall off with a G
Ride with the P, 89 creep
On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps
His alarm clock beep, I be right there
Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice
Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there
Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here
We ain't runnin'
We be gunnin'
Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin'
Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion
Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon
Don't wanna brawl with 5-6 hog
I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes
I'm a gorilla in every state
Your opinion don't mean shit mind yo business
Before I give your mind a business
Ask matadors I ain't bullshittin'
Bitches
Bleh bleh

[Intro]
The best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
And that's what you gon' get any time you fuckin' with us
Finally Famous, what's up?

[Verse 1]
I'm on the west side of my city
Ridin' round like a tour guide
With that white girl she got a tongue ring
That might as well be a bullseye
She half naked walking 'round this bitch
I almost thought I was poolside
Tryna raw dog my... (oh!)
Like her tubes tied but that's suicide!
One time for my niggas who made something out of nothing -
Cause you could lose it all my nigga look at David Ruffin
"You could lose it twice as fast as you got it"
Got it - that's what my grandma told me
And you've got to be a dumb dumb dumb motherfucker
Not to listen to what you hear from the OG's
Rollin' OG 'til I G-O
Yeah G-O, nigga, add an O-D
That's what I rep, nigga, 'til I O-D
Collecting everything that this world owes me
I told my Momma grab you any kind of car
Girl cause you my shining star, I love you everywhere you are
Back to it - to the game I am committed
My intentions: stay persistent
Workin' overtime like we get paid off commissions
And my wrist bliss, work
Ms. Gliss, man I ain't got time like my wristlit
No bitch fit, just a fit bitch
Who's only job is to make me feel terrific

[Chorus]
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on

[Verse 2]
I'm on the east side of my city
Ridin' round like it's "Doomsday"
And if you keep pushing my buttons
Might fuck around and be a "Tomb Day"
Don't let go of her hand
Or it might be "Big-Sean-In-Her-Womb Day"
"Congratulations, dog!" man, that's what the whole room say
I want money and security for all of my descendants
We up in Hollywood, tryna get our hands cemented
If you don't fuck with my songs
Man, you gotta fuck with the intention
Tryna get my fam and friends-es
Behind Benz-es, and Cartier lenses, woah
I believe I can fly, I believe I'm the man
I believe in God
Man, they sending shots, shots, shots, shots
Like they don't believe I can die
Man, fuck whoever used to tell me to stop
A legend in the making -
Fuck whoever told me I'm not

[Chorus]
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on

[Intro: Big Sean]
Ugh (Cannon)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Couple niggas on a hit list and bitches on a different type
Same shit, different nights, 'til I live a different life
"Sean, you lookin' tired," damn, homie, that's all?
I've been stressing so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hating
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slipping like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleeping with that MAC and I ain't talking 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hoping that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there, too, ugh

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Post-Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Ooh-ooh, if I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this motherfucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
Just don't wake me up (Don't wake me up)
You can't catch me dreaming
About all of this motherfucking money
Cocaine rush, I'm speeding
Cocaine rush

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time, I'm acceptin' the fact
That there'll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, I'm just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred, that's why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as y'all can imagine, is chatty, yapping at me
Five years ago, I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, I'm over the fame
You number one, I'm number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames? We ain't rolling the same
I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this motherfucker with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids, I ain't giving your ass no respect
(Sean, I love you, my nigga, I'm out)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break your fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that's innovative, creative
Just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a—I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The Devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

[Chorus: Big Sean]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life, la-da-da
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a hundred things to do before I die
Wondering if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night, la-da-da
La-da-da, da
La-da-da, as I look up to the sky
I thought about a hunnid things to do before I die

[Young Jeezy Speaking]
Yeah, you know what this is, nigga. You know who this is. That's right, Young, nigga. I'm like one of Detroit's own, you know. I fuck with the D so much cause, you know, it's a natural place of born hustlas. You know, real niggas, money go gettas, against all odds, you know. I remember the first time I came to the D for a show, you know what I'm sayin'. Um, I hit the homies up, let 'em know I was in town. I was sitting at the Atheneum, and mufuckin' um, the show was over at the Zoo Bar, and nigga we walked - literally - 300 deep to the club, all black tees. Matter of fact, we walked back from that mufucka, you know what I'm sayin'. I went and did my show, repped out, you know what I'm sayin', walked back to the hotel, hung out...for a minute and niggas was like, "Yo, let's hit the Sting," and I'm like, "What the fuck is that?" "It's like a strip club in the hood. That shit stay open every night." I'm like, "Shit, that's right up my mufuckin' alley," you know. But you know most of all, you know about the D, I got mufuckin' niggas in the D that I really love and fuck with genuinely, nigga, as they fuck with me befo'. You know, it was really rap shit. You know when I was trappin' mixtapes, niggas in the D was fuckin' with me like I was from 7 Mile or some shit, you know what I'm sayin'. West Side, Southwest, for real. I was tellin' a nigga Sean, I'm like, I said, "Nigga, it ain't a lot of superstars in the D." I was like, "Nigga, they got you and Eminem, but other than that, nigga you know, they got street legends, nigga. You know, niggas who really done that shit. Got it in, ya feel me?" What up, doe!

[Common Speaking]
Yeah, what up! It's Common right here! Y'all know where I come from, and uh, shoot I used to come to the D. I used to go to Detroit, like, every two weeks to record with J Dilla. I be standing at the Atheneum, and then, you know, he'd come scoop me up; he had a Range. We'd either eat, we'd eat at a Coney Island, close to his crib. He stayed 'round McNich'. We'd go down in his basement and stuff, and Jay Dee would dig through the records and then he would make a beat. And then once he make a beat, I'd be like, "Yo that beat cold," and then I'd just sit there. And Frank, Frank would be around. And then you know, and we'd just be kicking it; I'd be getting some Heinekens and stuff, and then uh, they'd go to Chocolate City, to the strip club. And I wasn't all into the strip clubs at the time, so I'm like yo, I'd just be like, I'd sit there and be like, "I'm about to write this rap." Then one time I was like, "I'm going to the strip club with y'all." I went to the club, and man they had some good chicken wings, man some good, thick girls, and it was right. Anyway, I love the D, man; We used to kick it off in the D. That was like all day. That's what we do

[Intro]
I look up

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now, oh
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 1]
Tequila glasses (Whoa)
Shots to the head, 'cause some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp, an eighth of gin and half my friends
Gone, gone, man, fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
'Cause when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop, pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers tryna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin' off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?
Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 2]
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin', I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did

[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 1]
I don't want the street lights
Laughing at the grave
He swears he's gonna give it up
It's never gonna be enough

I just wanna be there
When you're all alone
Thinking about a better day
When you had it in your bones

[Hook]
This could be the end...
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end

[Verse 2]
I see you in the evening
Sitting on your throne
You're playing with a fireball
And posted up against the wall
I just wanna hold you
Take you by your hand
And tell you that you're good enough
Tell you that it's gonna be tough

[Hook]
This could be the end...
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end...
Cos I ain't got a home

[Verse 3]
Running from the street lights
Shining on the grave
Once you've had the good stuff
Never gonna fill you up

I wanna be the one who
Gives them all a whirl
And gives them all the finger at it
Just a little taste of it

[Hook]
This could be the end...
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
Cos I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
Said I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
No I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
I ain't got a home

[Seal]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

[Verse 1 - DMX]
I wish upon a star, wish upon the night
I wish that everything that happens in the dark, comes to the light
I wish upon the days, wish upon the dream
I wish that everybody only said, what they mean
I wish I could have caught you, before you fell
I wish nobody had to go to hell
I wish Adam wouldn't have listened to Eve, when he bit the apple
I wish the Ku Klux Klan didn't own Snapple
I wish that nobody had to ever know the pain, that comes with the mental rain
I wish that no parent ever have to bury a child
I wish you wouldn't hurry to get wild
I wish for so many things, in so little time
I wish all these wishes weren't mine
But all I can do, is wish and hope it comes true
Pray to God and hope it comes true!
Have Faith!

[Seal]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

[Verse 2 - Slug]
(I feel you X. Let me tell you what I wish for)
I'm wishin' there was no hunger or starvation
That God'll take back the nation from Lord's Satan
I wish I never popped pills, that I robbed from my grandpap, dyin' in a hospital
I wish I didn't lust more, I wish I could trust the Lord for a month or more
I wish I could physically touch or see Jesus in the flesh leavin' nothin' left to stress
I'm wishin' we were focused on the hopeless, broke n', strugglin' mothers who are dope sick
I'm wishin' New Orleans hadn't looked like an over flooded pool, with no chlorine
I'm wishin' Bill Clinton would return and I don't care, let him get his nuts sucked through the whole term
I wish I wasn't so selfish, I wish I ain't chase this cake, like I don't know what wealth is

[Seal]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

[Bridge]
And the hours, and the minutes, and the seconds
Are just as important, take, nothin' for granted
And try to hold on, to LOVE, cause now I

[Seal x2]
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen

I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen...

[Intro: Big Sean]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tell the police I'mma stack this paper 'til I overdose
Whodie holdie slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close
I overflow all over hoes, my niggas is over hype
Shooting up your Phantom
Now they call your shit the Holy Ghost
Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes
That when life ain’t sweet, they gon' desert me
Shut the fuck up and stand up when you see me
Like I'm the verdict
That's respect, now I got your wifey
And you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling
Tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge your ass a "fuck you" fee
And make you pay your tax today
I'm on a secluded island, swear it feel like Cast Away
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away
I feel like getting paper is my destiny
'Til I rest in peace, get money recipe
Told my mom "Get what you want
Then just leave the rest to me"
Ain't no motherfucking rest for me

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Diamond rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got cars, cribs all in my neck
Got them M's all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint
Stacking bread, come watch me plank
Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat, we ain't shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ain't everything homie, it's the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist
Eating good, I ain't brolic, I'm just chasing them commas
My niggas ride that five, and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Praise God, hallelujah

[Outro: Big Sean]
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride me?
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me?
Where my fine freaks, fine freaks, fine freaks?

[Outro: Big Sean]
Yep, ay, I told my...

[Verse 1]
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

[Chorus]
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 2]
Three bodies lyin' there
Does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says
And he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand

[Verse 3]
I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

[Verse 4]
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

[Verse 5]
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black
You might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

[Verse 6]
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

[Verse 7]
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

[Verse 8]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!”

[Chorus]
Here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 9]
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

[Verse 10]
“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”

[Verse 11]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow

[Verse 12]
You’ll be doing society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

[Verse 13]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
"It’s my work", he’d say, "and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way"

[Verse 14]
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man
Into a mouse

[Verse 15]
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus
He never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum

[Verse 16]
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one
Who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

[Verse 17]
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,”
Guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

[Verse 18]
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game

[Verse 19]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis
And watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha
In a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

[Outro]
Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Ron Isley]

Trying to slick a can of oil who you think you fooling
Now get on out my face (Baby)

Getting faded in the Phantom, ain't no stopping a riot

She love the way that I dress and the way that I stroke
She said she never sipped lean, I said I never did coke

He see me in the evening
Wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, oh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yeah, ayy, yo, ayy, yo
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas' watches is rough
Grabbin' our crotches, yellin', "What up?"
The jeans cost five hundred? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see the smell, it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs, kid
I'm a gangster, corporate hustler, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga, we armed, trust me, bruh
They yellin', "Chef killer, play with the cooks"
I say, "Yay", with two chains on, we common, let's push
Burn another bush then burn another, we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce, just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock, yo?

[Chorus: Andrea Martin]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when

Wanna catch all these feelings

I was born by a lake, chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, trying to see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development (Oh)
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All 'cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (Ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'Til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push

[Chorus: Andrea Martin & 2 Chainz]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when

Four doors of ammo
Ammunition, I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: Cyhi the Prynce]
Yeah
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think the Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Huh, fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flicked a nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without a A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Bridge: Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
(Woah)
Yeah, you feeling on top now?
Getting that money, nigga?
(You, you sold your soul)
(Hey, hey)
Yeah, you feeling on top now?
(Hey, hey)
Getting that money, nigga?
(You sold your soul)
(Woah)
Yeah, you feeling on top now?
Getting that money, nigga?
(Hey, hey)
Nah, man, mad people was fronting
(Hey, hey)
Aw, man, made something from nothing

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. would have been G.O.D., except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
All money, you sold your soul
Nah, man, mad people was fronting
God damn, we made something from nothing

[Verse 1]
One look sends it coursing through the veins
Oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains
To form expressions on their stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Well, the heartbeat's at its peak
When you're coming up to speak
And oh, I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer
And I'm talking gibberish
Tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh, it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark
You'd see how red my face has gone, yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that
To make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off
Are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me
Say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up
I'm sure I could write the book
And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks, yeah

[Verse 3]
Never again
Well, never again, no
Will there be another one quite as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing through the veins
Oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains
To form expressions on their stupid faces

[Verse 1]
Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
And there's a super cool band, yeah
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, I don't want to hear your

[Verse 2]
Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at the back, all
Wishing they weren't there
And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah, she's dashing for the exit
Oh, she's running to the streets outside
"Oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band were fucking wank and I'm not having a nice time"

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, but his bird said it's amazing though, so all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind, but deaf

[Bridge]
He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance, but I'm sure that's far
Yeah, I'm sure it's pretty far
And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook, yeah

[Intro]
Hi-oh-i-oh-ay (Woah)

Hi-li-hi-li-hi-li
Hi-oh-i-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Lights on, stage set, huh
I guess I gotta put on a show again 'cause everyone's waiting
Females, fly jets
When I turn the radio on, I hear all my songs play, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever money can buy, I've probably got it
And that's real talk (Oh-oh, oh-oh), yeah
I see my name in the sky all over the world (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I just sit here saying

[Chorus]
Lucky me, I gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down, I still wear a smile
Lucky me, even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd (For the crowd)
Lucky me
I pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars (Lucky me)
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard (Lucky me)
Wouldn't put this on no one else, else (Lucky me)

Hi-oh-i-oh-ay
Hi-li-hi-li-hi-li
Hi-oh-i-oh-oh
Hi-li-hi-li-hi-li
Hi-oh-i-oh-ay
Hi-li-hi-li-hi-li
Hi-oh-i-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
So exclusive
I don't have to wait in the line, it's like the club is mine now
If it was only that simple
Then what I'm saying is easy to do (Easy to do) and we know that's not true (That's not true), oh, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever money can buy, I've probably got it
And that's real talk (Oh-oh, oh-oh), yeah
I see my name in the sky all over the world (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I just sit here saying

[Chorus]
Lucky me, I gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down, I still wear a smile
Lucky me, even though I'm so damaged
Gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd (For the crowd)
Lucky me
I pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars (Lucky me)
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard (Lucky me)
Wouldn't put this on no one else, else (Lucky me)

[Bridge]
My dream and it's my heart, the life of being a star
You don't even know how hard it is, do you? Yeah
Now I'm thankful for everything and I'm finally becoming a man
Now I gotta bigger show to do

[Chorus]
Lucky me, I gotta pose for the cameras
Even when my world's falling down, I still wear a smile (Oh)
Lucky me, even though I'm so damaged (So damaged)
Gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd (For the crowd)
Lucky me
Pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars (Lucky me)
'Cause nobody said it'd be so hard (Lucky me)
I wouldn't wish this on no one else, else (Lucky me)

[Intro]
I was born bad, but then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do

[Verse 1]
Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist
Whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here
Pour me a cold one

[Pre-Chorus]
Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say, hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

[Chorus]
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Verse 2]
Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine
Let's get it on

[Pre-Chorus]
Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Glamorous but underaged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely, so can you be my savior?

[Chorus]
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Bridge]
I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?

[Chorus]
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Hook]
Everybody do the crayon, crayon x4

[Verse 1]
Black or blue, purple or yellow
Or red
See, we all in this box together
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
The world is like a coloring book
To get the whole picture each other it took
So

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me

Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Woo!)
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
(Believe me, darling!)

When you told me (Woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down

Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman, my name is Macklemore. This is my music, and it feels so damn good right about now. Check it, I got a story, yo, it goes a little something like

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC
And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID
"Ayo, son, you better get that shit when you in NY" (okay)
So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try
To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine
5'9", blues eyes, born in nineteen-seventy-nine (just right)
Nervous as hell, I went to the store with my homie
Came out and yelled "Dawg, they sold me a 40"
Yeah, you know that I was the man
Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram
No more looking for bums, standing in the rain
Stranded on Broadway and giving 'em all my change
For the rest of the summer man I was on fades
Seventeen, had it made, getting drunk everyday
Ayy, I got treated a whole new way
Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age

[Interlude]
You know what I'm saying, all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and you're in the club. Seventeen like bah! Check it out, it's like this, yo

[Verse 2]
Now for the next three years I had so much fun
Getting drunk in hip-hop clubs where you had to be twenty-one
Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign
That said KRS-One twenty-one up and live
That's hella tight
Ayo I heard he always ripped it
So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket
When I got up the the door the bouncer checking ID's
Looks at mine and he's like "Nah, we don't take these"
I tried to reach and grab my shit back
But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq, on crack
I should've punched him, but I would have reached his knee cap
And that probably wouldn't have hurt him very much
He kept laughing and smilin', he called me a dumb shit
And if I would've let myself I would have cried in public
Oh no, I'm like "Give it back, bro!"
But no, my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo

[Bridge]
Ha I'm laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and it's still not very funny. Fucker

[Verse 3]
Bitch why you got to take my ID?
Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea?
I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs
And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten
*Get 'em*
Your mother is dumb for having you
You're a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you
*Get 'em*
You're too big and you never seemed to listen
You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens
*Get 'em*
I don't like ya, at all I despise you
If I was tall I would fight you
If I was a dog I would bite you
Every single day you make people cry
And your job is to go and ruin teenager's lives
Ok I'm going too far bouncers aren't all bad
I'm sure they make great husbands and really strong dads
But hopefully you learned a lesson from me
Never take an MC's fake ID
Yup, I said never take an MC's fake ID
You could be buff and tough, it don't matter to me
Cause you're going to get burned if you step to MCs

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smile's returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Outro]
Here comes the sun, doo da doo doo
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her
Every time she falls, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
And she will be loved

[Outro]
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
(I don't mind spending every day, ooh)
(Out on your corner in the pouring rain)
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

[Intro]
Ah, the Runners presents
Damage, you know (Woah-oh)
Sometimes you don't realize what you've done (Woah)
Until you've seen the damage (Woah-oh)
And I looked at the damage
Yeah, woah, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah
Look at the damage, yeah

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. when my phone ring
Begging me to come by, I was right around the corner (Corner)
I know I could've said no, but I ain't stop
Told me, "Come in, the door's unlocked for you"
My intuition, I should have listened to it
My girl, yo, she'd be pissed if she knew about this visit (Visit)
She had a tank top on, I took her tank top off but should've stopped (Stopped, ah)
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently, she tempt me
Right then I stopped thinking consequences (Consequences)
Guess I must have lost my mind for a minute, listen

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust (Yeah)
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up (Yeah, yeah)
One phone call started this whole thing now (Yeah)
Look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage (The damage)
Damage, damage that I caused you (That I caused you)
I know I broke your heart (Your heart)
'Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage that I caused

[Verse 2]
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love (Love)
I gotta live with regret, deserve to get what you give
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying (Woah-oh)
I rode passed your house for hours, just to feel close to ya
No cards, no gifts, no flowers, could get me back with you
Your kiss, your touch, girl, you know I'm missing (Hey, hey)
But you got my heart inside a prison, listen (Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up (Yeah, yeah)
One phone call started this whole thing now (Yeah, hey)
Look at the damage (The damage, I see the damage)
Look at the damage (The damage, that I caused you, girl)
Damage, damage that I caused you
I know that I broke your heart
'Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage that I caused

[Bridge]
I was tripping (Oh), I was dipping (Oh)
With these women (Oh) in these streets (Oh, yeah)
Lost my girl (Oh, yeah), lost all that (Yeah)
Wish I could take it back (Yeah)
I was tripping (Hey), I was dipping (Oh)
With these women (Oh) in these streets (Oh)
Wish I could (Oh), take that back, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up (Yeah, yeah)
One phone call started this whole thing now
Look at the damage (The damage, the damage that I)
Look at the damage (The damage)
Damage, damage that I caused you (Oh, that I caused you)
I know I broke your heart (Yeah, yeah)
And girl, I did you wrong now look at the damage (The damage)
Look at the damage that I caused

[Outro]
Yeah, woah
Look at the damage
Look at the damage, yeah
You know, sometimes you don't realize what you've done
Until you've seen the damage and I looked at the damage

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

[Outro]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Beat it like a boxer, eat it like a lobster
Tell me your desires, get you higher than a Rasta

You should let me drive, girl, the ride's really long
If you wanna ride, ride, ride, you can
You just gotta lie, lie to your man

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]

I'm in that Murcielago, ridin' through Chicago
And it's 12 o'clock, 12 o'clock on my Movado
Yeah, I know, me and CB, it's like back to back Diablos
Drop the top, put on your goggles
Swim with the young Mike Phelps under my Gucci belt
I said swim, not unstrap my Gucci belt
More choppers than Johnny Depp and the mobsters
So many Game imposters ridin' ram in the boxsters
I'm in DeVille
Sippin' on Belvedere vodka, so many tricks
Hit 'em in a little bit, can't rap my ish
I ain't no chicken, ish never been no tricky ish
If I buy a bottle, she a model when she lickin' it
If I'm goin' down, I'm eatin' it like quick and split
Knockin' on my dressin' room just to get flick with Chris
She spillin' my Cris', freakin' on my fresh fit (Ayy)
Curve, that's when I get on to the next chick (Ayy)

In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Hook: Big Sean]
So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go-go-go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know-ow-ow
Ow-ow-ow {*8X*}

[Wiz Khalifa]
While I'm flying over literally, flying over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto

[Big Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm
Going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue, I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one; you got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

[Hook]

[Big Sean]
...Yeah
Ohh, yeah
...Ohh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
First thing’s first man let’s get some understood
I’m a street nigga straight up out the hood
I remember the first day I met the plug
When I came back to the city bussin jugs
Tell the jack boys I wish a nigga would
On the real my nigga we been gambling good
.44 full, dog, up in the club
I’m obsessed with sipping lean and smoking bud
My mama say the neighbors think I’m selling drugs
I told my mama chill and then gave her a dub
I turnt the stove on then gave mama a hug
Now when these niggas re-up, they re-up with us

[Chorus]
Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Man a nigga set tripping in the wrong damn hood
Call a nigga cuz when he shoulda said blood
Hood nigga know that he gotta show love
Pull up to the club spend a whole damn dub
Hey, it’s your god damn move
You arguing about a bitch and she’s a god damn slut
What? And now you car shot up
Beefing bout a bitch with a glued on butt
Hey, you tryna act all tough
Got them hundos in my pockets
Stamped in god we trust
Stupid waves no brush, she screaming
How he cookin' dope and he ain't using no fork

[Chorus]
Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, jug and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
1991 when I first start jugging
Wouldn’t make a profit till I first start cooking
I’m standing on the crest like the boulder crest bully
Call your plug and tell that nigga that that Gucci Mane took it
If you lock me up I’m gonna get out and start back juuging
Sun valley apartments and the Neighbors keep looking
Gave a nick to my uncle and I told him how was it
Glass house, straight drop, yeah he loved it
Got a stash house, a scrap house, my trap house bunkin
Flashback, I damn near had to bust my cousin
Playing fucking games with the Gucci man money
Jugs, jugs, jugs, jugs, jugs hope these jugs keep coming

[Chorus]
Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, jug and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Jug, jug, Jug, jug, Jug, jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug

[Verse 1]
I'm an Irishman
Leather weathered Irish skin
Beard orange as the sunset or the flag
In the night sky we fly it in
Pride for the life we fight to live
History, I write with it
Spit it with the dialect
And this is a celebration of course
The green, white, orange
And when they pulled up on that shore
First generation born
Toast to those that made it on a boat to New York
And when the English came the colonizer came
They filled up bottles of gasoline, turned 'em into balls of flame
And hurled 'em to protect what's ours
Don't touch these lucky charms
Whole bunch of Irish screaming "Fuck the London Guard"
I'm kidding not dissin' London, it's bloody raw
But go against the Irish and get a bloody jaw
Preaching nonviolence but reminds of the scars
Unify us, put a pint up everybody sing a song

[Hook X2]
We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya

[Verse 2]
From New England to New Brunswick
Galway to Dublin
A rebellious nation of freckled face hustlers
Heart, blue collared workers and family
My heritage, proud to be a Haggerty
Now with whiskey in our veins
Claiming we're the bravest men
I drank Old Crow, but pretended it was Jameson
Dad sipped Guinness, I sipped Old English
'Til he sat me down at 16 and said "boy, this is what a beer is"
I put down the drink, couldn't drink like a gentleman
That doesn't mean I can't make a drinking song for the rest of 'em
Challenge us in football, yeah we might lose
But don't put us next to a bar stool
We take the history, script it in song
Light the torch then you pass it on
That's right I said, lineage through the rhythm we script it from the palm
And we give til' Ireland is on
Bottoms Up

[Hook X2]
We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya

[Outro]
Tonight, we're celebrating life
Those are all my Irish goons in the background
Put 'em up!
Because you know
All the way from Ireland
To the States
From Dublin to Boston
Grafton to Seattle
My whole Haggerty family
This one's for you
Let's go
And all my people say (hey!)
All over the world
Even if you're not Irish
Put your glasses up
Ryan Lewis and all my people say
That's Ireland
It's beautiful isn't it?
Irish celebration
And all my people say
Versus

[Hook]
We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight cause you can't take it with ya

[Verse 1]
He's pining for her in a people carrier
There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got, keep on turning 'em down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen

[Verse 2]
He's got the feeling again, this time on the aeroplane
There might be tellies in the back of the seats in front, but Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

[Chorus]
And it feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, I saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us, it seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat, and half wonder if you won it at all

[Chorus]
And don't say owt 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

[Outro]
Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery
What's happened to me?

[Snoop Lion Speaking]
Yeah, it's so cold in the muthafucking D. I'm talking 'bout real cold mane. I'm talking 'bout June 19-mothafuckin'-86, on the West Side off 8 Mile Road, living with my pops while he was working at a mufuckin' post office. Right around the corner, I was working at McDonalds, getting up in the morning doing that breakfast shift. I was so cold on the mothafuckin' eggs, they called me Young Eggs, mane. I mean I had it locked and loaded. I was gon' fuck around and go to school out there too. The coaches wanted me to come to Cooley High and play basketball and do my thang. But you know what man, the experience I had in Detroit was a hell of an experience because it shaped me, it molded me, it grew on me. I came back from Detroit, I was new and improved. I remember I wrote me a song. I said uh, "I went to Detroit to make my move. I'm on track, now I'm back, and I'm new and improved." That's how I came back from Detroit, you understand me. I was new and improved. So all my folks out there in the D, it's so mothafuckin' cold from the West Side to the East Side. Y'all know what it is. I used to stay on Whitehill Street on the East Side too, right by the Eastland Mall, ya dig. So I mean I'm well rooted and tooted and suited and booted. Part of the D is part of the G and the LBC. This is Big Snoop Dogg. Big Sean, you know what it is. Detroit! Let's go

[Verse 1]
Yo, remember high school?
With that dude who thought he was so cool
Walking around like everybody should know who, he is
Like he was some superstar in the biz
Just because he had a Japanese car and some rims
It's silly ain't it?
It goes to show how tainted
Cause these hoes jocked him like he was somebody who supposedly made it
And I'm not hating man, the dude was my boy
But I watched girl after girl get their world destroyed
Now when a squirrels a squirrel and a nut is a nut
And I seen a lot of girls cut so they could get stuffed
Or at least be cool in the high school soap opera
Cause kids do anything to be popular
Guys get their hair cut so girls can jock ya
But if girls get with guys their known as a trick
But if a dude does the same shit, he's known as a pimp
And the question is: Is there really a difference?

[Verse 2]
Remember that girl in high school that everyone wanted to hit?
She wore them dresses with the bestest breasteses the size of Texas
And she was the queen of estrogen, White, Black, Puerto Rican, and Mexican
And she sat next to you in third period
She powdered her face but her skin had no flaws
Her tits looked like she wore three wonderbras
Thank God for that math book you put on your lap to
Cover up your jeans when your dick got hard
I mean she was amazing I'm not playing
You were like 14 but she was still the kind of girl you wanted a baby with
And I could tell the way that she would rock them pants
That a lot of dudes hit it but she wanted a chance
You talked to her, but she gave you the shoulder
She was the type of girl that was cold as Boulder
She'd only mess with ya if you drove a Rover
What I push? Well fuck it
Let's just say a bucket. OK
Anyway one day I rocked a show
And I see her right there chilling up in the front row
Next time I go to my math class for sho' she's talking about
"Hey yo bro, I didn't know that you flowed
Hey yo what's up with that CD? Maybe we could eat lunch after P.E
Ah hee hee hee hee hee"
If it's the mic you rock, the car you got, the 3-pointer you shot that get's the girl then she's probably a breezy

[Verse 3]
Remember high school with that girl you can't remember? (Who?)
The one that never stuck out, she kind of looked like whatever
Kinda nerdy, never came to the parties
She went home after school and never really chilled with nobody
She was in one of your classes and used to wear glasses
With braces that accented her pimples that weren't really attractive
But she was good in Spanish and let you cheat off her answers
But when you'd see her in the hall you would walk right past her
You acted like a bastard and never treated her right
Cause her body wasn't buckling and her face wasn't tight
Well guess what
See that beautiful girl with the big butt
Standing at the incense shop reading the poetry that she writes
That's her. Oh hell nah, I know that's not her
Wait minus the pimples, the braces, and a lot less nerd
Take off the overalls and the baggy sweatshirt
Yeah there she is, reading about her words
Shit, man I'mma go spit some game
Wait I see some resemblance from like way back in the day
I rememeber that girl that only liked me cause I rhymed
And now I'm really only talking to this girl cause she looks fine
Back when she was normal I wouldn't give her my time
Shit that's crazy
I kinda feel sleezy
If I could flip the scenario
I'm the same as these hoes
Kinda like the male version of a breezy

[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 1]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 1]
Been thinking about you
Your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one
And you're my star
What do you care?

[Verse 2]
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care when the other men are far, far better?

[Chorus]
All the things you've got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?

[Verse 3]
I've been thinking about you
So how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends
They're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
And why should you care, when I'm not there?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care, when I'm not there?

[Chorus]
All the things you've got
That you'll never need
All the things you've got
I've bled and I bleed to please you

[Outro]
Been thinking about you

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed

[Verse 2: XV]
Look, it’s too bad that he’s too good
Never giving up but it’s sad that you would
My crew like a couple of clansmen, too hood
And when it came to putting on Kansas, who would?
Vizzy, no trying, couple figures on and I’m sitting on Bryants
Game started buzzing so I’m sitting on hydrants
Nah Joe, I’m highjack, you can call me a Somali pirate
All black wallet, inside Irish, mean it’s all green
Yeah, I’m mean with this fly shit, they buzzing like bees in a high nest
Girls getting on they knees for your highness
And I’m running these streets, no bright vest
Stick to the paper, damn, I’m a fly catch
I’m tryna live more, die less and if you tryna get yours, holla X, XV
You should OD off of this rhyme ‘cause I’mma change minds like cold feet
In store for a meal, groceries but they be like “We don’t normally come out at night mostly”
Go and get your rosaries ‘cause I’m about kill this, no halo like Sony
And if your girl a little horse like a pony, ahem, well of course, start pointing
Fly Boy Club, well of course I’m soaring, always gonna
Always be in the air like Jordan
And they always gonna stare, just ignore ‘em
Now you with the X man, I’mma call you Storm
I’m touring her, under that hood and um it’s foreign up under that hood and um
I feel like a dude this cool should feel so I guess I feel good and um XV, J.Cole, we in

[Verse 3: J.Cole]
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day’s found, this is my playground

[Verse 4: XV]
Look, I’mma spit it from the top of the dome, don’t normally do this
But I’m feeling real cool, I am ruthless, like Eazy-E was, I am toothless
Like that one fiend was, I am killing shit like I never do this
I never do this but I’m gonna spit it straight from the top oh
And I know niggas done heard about Kansas but I’m about to do this motherfucker
I done ran shit since ‘02 and I was like oh and y’all niggas don’t know
I’m about to prove man what everything that I’m doing is about to do a movement
X to the V, who you booing? Look, I don’t even do this normally but I’mma do this
Accordingly, cordially, I am dope, yes dude
I have never wrote this shit down in my head
I have spoke shit you that never ever said
‘Cause I’m dope, y’all niggas dead, fresh, chill nigga, I am gonna get this
X to the V, y’all niggas witness, I’m about to throw ‘em back, ruler this
Y’all niggas doing this, y’all niggas know that I’m moving shit
And if you don’t know it right now, google it, I’m about to be on every blog
Doing shit, I’m about to do this shit like E told me do, look, look, I don’t know

[Verse 5: J.Cole]
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thicker than these cute bitches, we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV

[Verse 6: XV]
They be like Vizzy on some other shit, on his MCDs ‘cause they loving it
Pockets fat like the Klumps in it, my flow is something sick, no asking
Proactive couldn’t stop bumping it, nowadays I be on some other shit
Ladies think I’m gone kinda like my upper lip, wrong
Like a broken condom, pause, ‘cause Hoff go raw
It’s something you really shouldn’t be fucking with
Came through whipping, paint still dripping
They say like Sheneneh, oh no you didn’t
Know that one saying when your palm start itching?
Well mine do some much, I had to start to wear mittens
And you think that I’m kidding, if I don’t slow down
They gon’ think that I’m driven, if I don’t go down, she gon’ think I hate fishing
Chill for a minute and I was like listen, Vizzy, gettin’, gettin’, gettin’
Y’all motherfuckers know I’m about to spit it straight up off the top of the dome again
How this nigga doing that? He be going in, I don’t even know shit
I be just blowing shit, I don’t even smoke and shit, how you know this?
By enrolling it, I don’t even know I got a backpack on
If you see me, take a flick of me and you niggas gonna blow the shit
‘Cause you were pointing at me like he gonna blow and shit
And them niggas be knowing it, if I be doing this shit all around the world and shit
All around the globe with it, man y’all niggas spit it in, I just get it in
Flow out here and manager from Switzerland, nigga from Kansas
And y’all niggas whipping it, how you motherfuckers doing it?

Well I came home

And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

[Verse 1]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Chorus]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 3]
So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

[Verse 4]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Bridge]
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Intro: Adreena Mills]
Does it really get this cold in the summer
Does it really get this dark in the day
Do they really turn they backs when you talkin'
Would they lay somebody's else's head where you lay
Do they find it easy to be hard
And find it even harder to be easy
You know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder
If I ever left how much you'd miss me
Oh, somebody told me blood was thicker than water
If a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter
And if hell is below would you pay the price to go
Then I can make it to heaven for sure

[Hook: Adreena Mills]
This is a cold world (what), cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
This is a cold world (what), cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way

[Verse 1: DMX]
Cats don't know what they say what they talkin'
So I just let a nigga say what he feel
Fuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin
'Cause I'ma say what I gotta say with the steel
Niggas hatin' 'cause I got a job
I know it's they job to be hatin'
I'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats
'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen
It's about time I reacted
Look what y'all did to this rap shit
Knowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit
Wack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick
Blam, blam, blam, go down that quick
Actin' like the truth was gone
And I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one
It's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done
Hold up, I'ma show you why dog is the illest, kill this
You might not catch it, but you'll feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Middle name is grime, came from crime
You thought I'ma change with time, niggas don't know me
Let your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me

[Hook: Adreena Mills]
This is a cold world, cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
This is a cold world, cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way

[Bridge: Adreena Mills]
The tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep movin', movin', movin'
Because if life stops spinnin' in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'
See in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'
To see another day to give them somethin' to believe in
'Cause I know it won't always be this way
When you tryin' hard to make a change

[Intro]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Bridge]
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

[Verse 1]
I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

[Refrain]
It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

[Verse 2]
So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Verse 3]
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over

[Bridge]
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

[Outro]
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

[Verse 1]
Tell me do you want the world and everything in it?
What kind of girl are you?
Or are you being for real, when you tell all your friends
Real love will do?

I don't have much money but I don't subscribe
To the notion every woman has a price
I don't have much game that you can see through
But if honesty's a quality I won't make a fool out of you

[Hook]
Put it on my life, won't make a fool out of you
Lady I'd rather die, than make a fool out of you
I'm not a perfect man but baby give me the chance
And my heart will be all yours

[Verse 2]
So what I gotta do to get to you? I'm willing
To be everything you ever dreamed, existed
Through the good and the bad
I wanna be the first and last, what you been missing
I don't have much money but I don't subscribe
To the notion every woman has a price
I don't have much game that you can see through
But if honesty's a quality

[Hook]
I won't make a fool out of you
Put it on my life, won't make a fool out of you
Lady I'd rather die, than make a fool out of you
I'm not a perfect man but baby give me the chance
And my heart will be all yours

[Verse 3]
Money can't buy you happiness
Especially if it leaves regrets
A connection and affection
Put it together baby it's a blessing
And a good heart is all you need

Baby I don't have much money but I don't subscribe
To the notion every woman has a price
I don't have much game that you can see through
But if honesty's a quality I won't make a fool out of you

[Hook]
Put it on my life, won't make a fool out of you
Lady I'd rather die, than make a fool out of you
I'm not a perfect man but baby give me the chance
And my heart will be all yours
I won't make a fool

[Verse]
I'm so sick I go to the hospital
When I don't get fixed I get nicked by the brain surgeon
If I'm losing ya, sorry I'm just brain surfing
Move in ya mind like a five in the lanes twerk it
But I'm like a six with ya bitch twerk that
I'm on the strip with ya bitch working
And I don't like strippers, I like dyke bitches
That don't like strippers; that, like bitches
Like to fight strippers, Weezy F. Baby
I don't write shit, be on the hype shit
She on that white shit
I ain't talking about cum, put powder on my dick
Then she suck it til she numb, shit
I remember back in the day
When an ounce of coke was four hundred
And them bitches was gay
But now these niggas is gay
And you could probably get an ounce for eight
Shit, if you spend eleven hundred you straight
And now the niggas with money is the niggas that hate
And bitches want a broke nigga cause them bitch niggas fake
But that's why me, and my hooligans debating, ho
Which one of these rich niggas we taking?
I gotta make it, Lil Layla's six now
My little brother J.E. wanna cop bricks now
And little Marley, he just hold his chick down
Get 'em a Benz so he can roll his chick round
I blow big in a 'Lac like a big dawg
I keep that sig in my lap like my dick dawg
Shit make me bust a nut in yo face
Tell ya girlfriend, "Bitch
Wipe the slut off yo face, ho"
Where you from? I'll put you under your state
Then I go and throw a party at Bungalow 8
Yeah I'm something so straight feared I
Knock a nigga right up in his queer eye
I ain't playing nigga this is the year I must excel
Fans sending in cards say you must get well soon
Because I'm sick, so sick sick mean
I be with a cute thing
And she do her lip thing
Well as a matter fact I think you know her well
Everytime I'm with the girl you always blowing up her cell
What, would you stop me and shorty tryna chill, man
Shorty tryna feel on my eel
I shock her like Silk
I Chaka like I'm managing a Ludacris
Handling the uzi like a camera
Choose ya flick, ya strike a pose
We pull up-in Bentley
Niggas on the bikes is hoes
I'm that cold, nigga
I'm that cold. Nigga
Though I'm a hot boy
I'm that cold nigga

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
The game need balance, the game need balance
Woke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding
Picture me hating on a young nigga with talent
Album flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance
I was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest
Bitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest
Only one thing that I ask of you haters
You can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist
From straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this
My Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters
But you ignoring my pay raise
I made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week
To 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week
Ice and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep
Life's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets

[Produced by DJ Toomp]

[Intro]
The Noose of Jah City

[Hook]
It eats away at the brain
As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith

[Verse 1]
Now I'm surrounded
They saw me fall from here but not hit the ground
And I's been dying
The body found and my soul was left to drown
Suffocated in concrete
It took a hold of me
Put me on repeat
Now your last routine
And you start to leave
Towards an escape
But I feel sustained

[Hook]
It eats away at the brain
As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith

[Verse 2]
These walls got taller
I start to lose the sense of life
The rubicon's a warning
As I see they're washing away my pride
And in the tide
I saw the crimes I passed them by
I wonder why?
I question why?

[Hook]
It eats away at the brain
As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith

[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Verse 2]
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Outro]
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't never gonna part
...

[Intro]
Doing me like you do, cause I know that's what you do (x 5)

[Hook: DMX]
Never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut

[Verse 1]
Listen boo, you’s a bitch, you been a bitch
You know how niggas do
Run up in a bitch, fuck her well
And the bitch, you call them bitches
But then in a week or 2, fucking all them bitches
A nigga gotta fall back and take a breather
Shorty suck a mean dick but in the morning
Gotta leave her, wasn't trying to deceive her
I just wanted my dick sucked
She cute as a motherfucker
And she got a big butt
Now I'm like, what do I do from here
Cause she’s acting like she ain’t trying go nowhere
I ain't really trying to get attached to this bitch
Shit it's friday, I just want some ass in the bitch
Can’t be mad at me, I'm just doing what niggas do
Got kids by him, and you wanna be a nigga's boo? What!? Really!?
Oh you think it’s like that?
Ok! I’ll be right back

[Hook]
I ain't never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like "wassup?"
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
S don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like "wassup?"
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut

[Verse 2]
It was summer time, I was in the slumps
Seen that chick from before, I was like wassup
Remember me? I was that kid
It was you, her and me, we just did what we did
How you expect me to respect you
When I know a police file of other niggas that you gave your sex to
I ain’t never been a sucker, so if you think so
You got the wrong motherfucker
What’s my name? Ah ah, bitch! What’s my name?
You know what the fuck it is
I’m a real nigga, that’s gonna handle his

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I like the way you beat hits, oooh, that's that street shhh
Shorty can you keep a secret? ("Yes...")
You know what I’m trying to creep with
Come on, cars outside, hotels up the block
Jump in the ride, you and me for the rest of the night
It’s all good, click, ("Turn off the lights")
Back it up like that girl, ooh, that ass fat girl
We almost there baby, oh shit yeah baby!

[Hook x2]

[Eve]
Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
Cause the Ryders got me bringin home the bacon
Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin'
That I would dedicate this melody fuck the hatin'

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

[Eve]
Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggas seem (?) to the brain, how you feel Dogg?
Nigga I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg

[Snoop Dogg]
Baby girl you so so-phisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearing my name
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang

[Eve]
Yo - niggas surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly

[Hook - 2X]

[Snoop Dogg]
We gangbang on these niggas like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo - you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin
Thuggin, dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

[Eve]
Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

[Hook - 2X]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah.. hahah, E-V-E! D-O-double-Gizze! Y'know!

[Intro]
Black and mild is my friend
Black and Mild is my friend
I don't know how to begin so I really really Really want to start it again
I said black and mild is my friend
I never smile I pretend
And meanwhile I just sin
I really really really wanna know does it end (does it?)
Because it's always hard
And it's always dark
Sometimes I wonder why I ever decided to die at all

[Hook]
Na na na na na na na na na (x4)
All I feel is pain (but I have too)
Just to feel the rain ( so what have you?)
Everybody feels the same (so I guess we)
All just living a dream and we can't wake up

[Verse 1]
I'm really in a bad mood (Why?)
Someone took the mirror out of my bathroom (What?)
And they replaced it with a picture of a guy
He really looks familiar but I don't know why
Is it me looking at him (What you looking at?)
Or is it him looking at me? (Hey)
Sometimes I wonder why I ever decided to write this life at all

[Hook]
Na na na na na na na na na (x4)
All I feel is pain (but I have too)
Just to feel the rain ( so what have you?)
Everybody feels the same (so I guess we)
All just living a dream and we can't wake up

[Verse 2]
Okay Nobody feels me but me
No matter how many verses you can't experience me
So I'm just stuck up I don;t see
Stranded on a island and the population's awww
Well I can't really explain it all
Simply no time to talk cause there's no time at all (What time is it?)
Just know that my mind is yours
And keep in mind don't mind what behind the door

[Hook]
Na na na na na na na na na (x4)
All I feel is pain (but I have too)
Just to feel the rain ( so what have you?)
Everybody feels the same (so I guess we)
All just living a dream and we can't wake up

[Andre 3000]
This just my interpretation of the situation

[Lil' Wayne]
And this is my dedication
What's poppin’ dedication 4 ho (D4)
And this is dedicated, first off
To my city
The lost city of New Orleans
But umm, I wanna speak to my city
And I wanna let ‘em know that
We can’t be lost for long
And we damn sure can’t be lost forever
So it's time we find ourselves
Within all that water
Within all that dirt, within all that blood, within all that pain, within all them cries
It’s time to find ourselves, New Orleans
Because memories are everything
And when I say memories are everything
I mean it’s important what you are remembered by
And trust me. I, you, we
Don’t wanna be remembered as the lost city
I’d rather be remembered of the city that found glory after all that tragedy
Strength, yea
Also I built that skate park down there and get them kids off the streets
You’re welcome
But umm, we gotta get up man
Fuck it
Rise above it
So a lot of people ask me
What you gonna do for your city?

What you gone did for your city?
Motherfucker, that’s my city
Therefore I still got family members in that city mane
What the fuck I’mma do for them?
You know what I mean?
And I do my best, trust me
And that’s what the fuck I do for my city
I do this right here for my city man
That’s what the fuck I do for my city
I do me for my city
So therefore I am remembered by my city
Ya dig?

And this is also dedicated to
Them bitch niggas
You ho niggas, you pussy niggas
You broke niggas yea

And this also dedicated to the bad bitches

[Intro]

[x2]
It's what it is baby
It's straight biz baby
We ain't kids baby
We get down like that

[Hook]

[x2]
Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

[Verse 1]
(Check it), more money more problems
I thought more money would solve 'em
I spent more money in Harlem
Than Frank Lucas did before the boys got 'em
Now the shit done changed
How I'm feelin'? the shit look strange
I realize that shit ain't the same
'Cause at the end of the day this shit ain't a game
Nigga goin' through it but I slipped and fell
Ran to the hood, took a trip to Hell
Deal when I should, that's why all my shit sell
Always know I could, so I did well

[Hook]

[x2]
Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

[Verse 2]
If y'all only knew
What my life was like, and what I'm goin' through
Maybe you'd think before you talk (okay?!)
You better crawl before you walk (come on!)
You think havin' money is the answer?
Money ain't nothin' but another form of cancer
All you could do is watch me die
You don't wanna watch me cry, so watch me fly!
What you gon' do is watch me fly
Do my thing on that big stage in the sky
Lord, please, hold me down
'Cause now everybody wanna know me now

[Hook]

[x2]
Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

[Verse 3]
Please help me, which way do I go?
Life's a book, which page do I show?
'Cause I know, can't show 'em all
Even though I slipped and fell I won't fall
Get it? Okay, you don't
Some of y'all will but most of y'all won't
I'mma keep livin' life bein' the man
That God made me 'cause I know only He can save me

[Hook]

[x2]
Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

[Outro]
(Shouting)
I wish, I wish, ah I wish you knew!
I wish you fucking knew!
(Singing)
*humming* maAHmmaAHH
You love me
I don't wanna fall
I won't fall
I don't wanna fall
Please help me
I don't wanna fall
Ahh-ahh

[Intro]
"Yeahhhhhhh, yeah-yeah" (let these motherfuckers know!)

[Hook]
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, uh, let 'em know!)
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, uh, let 'em know!)
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, then give it to me like!)
"Yeahhhhhhh, yeah-yeah"
"I'm back!"

[Verse]
I flip through the tracks to get to the wax
Let these fucking cowards know I ain't slipped through the cracks
Dog back on the scene making a bunch of noise
You're a grown man, came to break boys
Man these niggas is toys but I don't play with 'em
So if you got guerrillas with guns, stay with 'em
Motherfucker we bang for war, we don't keep those things in drawers
When it rains it pours
Cold blooded killers, the murderers is senseless
To ID, we'll need forensics, or a dentist
Fuck with D.O.G and you will be
Straight up, D.O.A so R.I.P
Real niggas slip, but bounce right back
Went from an ounce to a brick like that
Camera's always on so nigga might act
Like they wanna fight, 'til I fight back
I'm back!

[Hook]
"To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, uh, let 'em know!)
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, uh, let 'em know!)
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, then give it to me like!)
"Yeahhhhhhh, yeah-yeah"
"I'm back!"

[Verse 2]
Scratch you to death, I'm a go getter
The rounds going, download more to Twitter
Slugs big as my finger collect 4 on your vest
And we'll still be able to play connect 4 on your chest
Or I could hit 'em in the mouth and make this bastard taste
Nothing but lead, told you I'm a basket case
You call me acid face
I spit lava, you better off smacking your father, don't bother
We're career criminals; we rob niggas
Double R for life, we mob niggas
Bitch niggas do what you do -- suck a dick
Fucking faggot, you've been off some sucker shit
Back up in your face "up in your grill"
Getting back up in that lab with a license to kill
Tell your mans and them to chill, if they don't want what you got
They thought they was fuckin with a gangsta but you not!

[Hook]
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, uh, let 'em know!)
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, uh, let 'em know!)
"I'm back! To hold you" (uh, uh, uh, then give it to me like!)
"Yeahhhhhhh, yeah-yeah"
"I'm back!"

[Verse 1]
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, the levee's going to break

[Chorus 1]
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay

[Verse 2]
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan

[Chorus 2]
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Ooh

[Bridge]
Oh, don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south, they got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago
Ah, ah, ah, hey

[Instrumental Break]
Ay, yeah
Ay, yeah
Ay, yeah

[Verse 3]
Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good

[Chorus 3]
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, ooh

[Verse 4]
All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night, sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Oh-ho

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you, ah
Going down, going down now
Going down, I'm going down now
Going down, going down
Going down, going down
Oh
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down now
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Drake]
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you

[Verse 2: Dawn Richard & Drake]
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keeps looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question

[Chorus: Colin Munroe & Drake]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (Uh)

[Verse 3: Drake]
I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We we're on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you (You)
I wonder whatever became of you

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
You won't be out in the streets
Mouth full of blood, and a soul full of heat
A house full of thugs, and the orders will be like;
"Don't leave 'til you get all of the Ki's"
Head full of holes, and your blood on my sneaks
Like "These is $650, your blood too cheap."
Me, I'm from New Orleans, where we hustle in the heat
And enough work to have the cops hustlin' for me, shit
Little city, but ain't nothin' here for free
I'm a Uptown nigga, put my money by my teeth, yeah
And its magic whenever I hear the beat
But give me a hundred Ki's, y'all will never hear from me, shit
Young Money, and the leverage is deep
I am better than I ever been, that other shit was weak
Fuck makin' it in the industry, I made it in the streets
Now my eyes is arms, and I'm taking what I see, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
C'yeah! You can get got on the spot
Shot in the club parking lot from the AK
I'm shootin' 'til the trigger get hot
I pull my sleeve over my hand, and then spray
Don't come with no revolvers, (Revolvers?)
Don't come with no revolvers, (Revolvers?)
Don't come with no revolvers, please
Cause these thing over 50 a piece

[Verse 1]
Remix
We fall asleep naked, we wake up naked
You know what that means, pussy for breakfast
And I know how she likes it, I'm a psychic
I eat it then I go back to sleep, that's that "itis"
And she be by herself she a loner
Trukfit, I'm the owner
I make her moan, call her Mona
I'd have a threesome if they cloned her
And me I'm purple kush forever
I'm purple drank forever
That dick make her feel retarded
She say I make her feel special
When I ain't thinking 'bout them other hoes
Ever since you put that pussy on me
I told her put that pussy on me right
And I'mma change your life
And don't sit on top of this dick if you're scared of heights

[Hook V.1]
And shawty be like

You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid

And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight

[Verse 2]
That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her

[Hook V.2]
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom
Then I turn on the lights, yeah
Then look in her eyes
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid, she a plus, first aid
I put her in her place and that's first place
Tunechi

[Verse 1]
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go?

[Bridge]
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again

[Outro]
You used to get it in your fishnets
(Falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(You took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
(You were just sounding it out)
Is anything as pretty in the past though?
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
(You're not coming back again)
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
(Oh...)

[Verse 1]
Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a
Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime
Come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign
Everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind
Even if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyes
Comprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itself
He said, "Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didn't help
So if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go
Further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll"
Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though
Til the day he carried by the big six, domino

[Verse 2]
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K Dot Thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier
On point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
With the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it
I'm in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day
Like a nympho, I been dope since s curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know
Any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo
I spawned with a dragon
He tried to throw his flame but I ducked and I stabbed him
Came out the battle laughing
That's a metaphor for any rapper who want it
I smack em 'til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel
That's no assumption, cool out before I move out
Hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out
The back seat
There's a dead guy on the freeway, oh it's not Dot
Tell the medics it's okay, a beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like the it's the realest shit I wrote
But to me it's a throw away
I stare at them four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough, I throw a spear at Nas, a jab at Jay
Matter fact, no, I take that back
See I don't play with real legends of rap like you do
And I'm crucial, concealed by real Crips and Soowoos
And they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing Compton!

[Announcer: Jeff Bass & Eminem]

Flows like a river so call me perpetual
Just wait till I deliver
I'm too cold, now shiver
Man I wish you niggas would

Remember I want no stress
My girl speaks no Englis
But haters do I rip through there chest with critical objects
Man you lost your chance
Aw man you pussy

Skipped your period, hooky
They think that I'm a rookie
The beast is what's inside of me
But yet they over look me
I'm in that ass, sodomy
Uh
These lyrics I'm saying
I can not believe
What I'm portraying
Niggas betraying like non-monogamy

[Geo]
Keep up
Picture this
Psychologically
How I'm coming out new
You should call it menarche
I'm dying to demolish what they put ahead of me
So I guess I am the wrecking ball to this melody
Thats why I go right at your face destroying all the bodily
I pick right at your brain they call me lector I devour thee
Full attack not cowardly
I have no farm surrounding me
We sovereign I'm with majest
And Kobe there's no passing we
I cooked up a masterpiece
Calculated
Chex mix
Charged up
Cleverly with
Clean and
Crisp
Complexity
Word till infinity
Address me as the seven seas
I switch it up so nicely
That reciprocals can't handle me

[Chorus]
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty

I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty

I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty
I'm nasty

[JCobe]
Hehhhh!
It's Jacoby man
Yea I'm just so nasty
Picture two incests masterbating fastly
Anchor of this track, niggas asking if I am sane
I'm so advanced it's like I hopped in a time machine
I just wanna be the best MC, dead or alive
Come at me wrong you'll doomed like the Columbine
I wanna make it to the top, thats a hell of a stride
Coming into this game strong, all you fucking haters can die
Other words i'll outline your body in chalk
See the yellow tape from the view like David Hasselhoff
Spittin with my G Prince, I leave prints, That is it
(Cough, Cough, Cough) Even my flow is sick

[Verse 1]
The birds they sang
The break of day
Start again, I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

[Chorus 1]
The sky is blue
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then, I'm up with the birds

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Might have to go, where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

[Chorus 2]
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way

[Outro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

[Interlude]
(Stone, stone, stone...)
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

[Intro]
Oh no, don’t you quit
Let another nigga see what you working with (x3)
You fly, you be on your Birkin shit
You make me wanna hurt you when you twerk that shit

[Verse 1]
Girl, make me wanna post up pics
Facebook, let me poke you
Put that booty on Instagram
20 more pics, going insta-H.A.M
I got money, you got friends
You think you bad, match me then
Hop in that Bugatti, tell them muthafuckin' coppers
"Come and catch me" then, catch me then
You be working all day
You deserve a place to get ratchet in (you ratchet!)
I’m the shit, somebody bring me the laxative
Me and my niggas go hard
And you just Tough Actin' Tinactin

[Pre-Hook]
That’s that shit, keep doing that
Lemme put my hands on it, pat, pat, pat
Get it popping, crack a leg
Money on you, on ya titties
Racks on racks

[Hook] (x2)
Oh no, don’t you quit
Let them, let them see what you working with
Girl swear to god I’ma hurt that shit
Do a good job, baby, work that dick

[Bridge] (x2)
Money in the air, money everywhere
Go and pop that pussy how I like

Don’t be wasting mine, right now
Baby, it’s about to go, go, go, go, go, go down
Ehe, he, he

[Verse 2]
You make me wanna take a video, video
You ready for Teddy Pain, here we go, here we go
Lay down, lay down, stay down, stay down
Okay now, fo' sho'
Grab them pillows, bite them covers
Me and my homies lay pipe, Mario brothers
Follow me, I got a mamacita
Drinking margaritas out my Louboutins

And in three nights, we gon' run two by ten
So bring six of them bitches that you hang with
And I’ma bring two of my friends
Girl that ass so fat, from the back
It look like you got on two Depends

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge] (x2)
Money in the air, money everywhere
Go and pop that pussy how I like

Don’t be wasting mine, right now

These broke niggas don’t like me, cause they say I think I’m all that
Now Coon cop that ‘rarri, I don’t even feel salty
Niggas claimin my flows I should put these niggas on Maury
And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Rolls, swag was surfing on ‘em like gnarley

[Intro]
Fucking wax man
What is this doing to us?

[Verse]
Heading towards a magical path
Rhyming over African jazz
Put the drug inside the crack of my ass
Do a squat then it falls out
Set it off, tell my whore, "Wear the mall out
Cop whatever, put it on the mastercard
Come home so I can fuck you really fast and hard"
(Yo who the fuck you with?) Oh, I'm with that bastard Jon
In the Porsche and the seats are made of mastodon
He had an accident and now he got a plastic arm
Got paid, got his mom a nail salon
Got laid, he can choose 'em from a catalogue
Russian, Taiwanese, whatever
They say I'm looking Siamese in leather
Little red devil on the dresser
Writing red pencil on the letter
Thin slices of the cheddar
Fold it up make my life better
We had the lunch at Osteria Morini
I had the calf's brain
Half glass of Cabernet on the PATH train
New year they still love me for my past fame
Like a soccer player call me by my last name
A young Zinedine Zidane
In Flushing Meadow Park drinking hennessy with mom
You might catch me out in Tennessee with wine
Won't even dine unless the ice sculpture centerpiece a swan

[Outro]
Fly away
Shit, won't even dine
Unless the ice sculpture centerpiece a swan

[Phil Mickleson Enbrel commercial]

Hit Busy Bee on Tuesdays

Yeah, this is for you

Only for you
(Ain't going nowhere, nowhere)
If I can't have you no one can
(Me for you)
It can only be me
You think I'm crazy huh? Maybe I am
You kept me on this pedestal no matter how much I let you down

[Chorus]
Just tell me that you'll hold me down
(Just me for you, for you)
I got you baby, I got you
(You can never find another man)
Just me, for you
(Just me for you, for you)

[Outro]
Girl, I'd rather die, if you took your love somewhere
Don't you even try, no, don't you take your love, away
You kept me on this pedestal no matter how much I let you down
Too long, you've had me on this pedestal

[Verse 1]
Well, they'll stone you when you're tryin' to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 2]
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walking through the door

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 3]
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck"

[Chorus]
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 4]
Well, they'll stone you and say that that's the end (Yeah)
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again (Yes they will)
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar

[Chorus]
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright

[Verse 5]
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone (Oh, yes they will)
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they're all brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Listen, Listen y'all wanna hear a story here it go
Sexual, she’s so X-rated where the kids can’t go
Think so, I know so experienced a week ago
Expedia.com to her throat, but still classy though
Which bothered me, like Amish people in my area code
3-1-0, Tyga man for her ringtone
So I never call her when she’s home, only cell phone
She hate it when I put her on hold, especially for other hoes, (Im Sorry)
Say wait, I’m a rapper and it runs in the family
Young Money family, GED family
I’m average, accepting all challenges
Sexy can I feel you with this camera and Kardashian ya…
And I don’t need no hook for this shit
Tyga Tyga man only wanna hit! (I do, I do)
I don’t need no hook for this shit, (no, no, no!)

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
Girl come over here let me whisper in your ear
And say the type of things that have you dripping like a tear
So I can treat it like a car crash and hit you from the rear
And leave your man mad cause you been missing for a year
Chea, Peep the youngin swag
You heard a bunch of braggin’
But she ain’t ever had nobody hit it like a punchin’ bag
You ain’t never got smashed in the backseat of a drop Jag
Legs in the air, while the cops pass
She tried to tell me that she never did a rapper
So I pulled out my lollipop and let her lick the rapper (What up Wayne)
And I never kiss her after, I pass her to my dawgs
Yeah, they like lottery numbers
Girl you have to hit ‘em all
See, first they start to choose
Now probably pussy’s oozin’
In a second, I'mma have her naked like Marques Houston
Yep, you messin’ with the boy of Houston
Robert Davis in my cup so let’s start this screwin’ (Sing to ‘em Short)
And I don’t need no hook for this shit, (oh yeah? And why’s that?)
Cause she gon’ let me hit(she gon’ let me hit)
Yep, she gon’ let me hit (she gon’ let me hit)
Yep, she gon’ let me hit!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

And when we wake up I'mma hit it ‘till we doze off
She say her pussy is the spot
And Im like if that’s the case I'mma beat it like Johnnie Cochran

Dear Jayne, How you gon tell me to fall back?

While we looking in the mirror wanna pull on your hair
Wake up in the morning wanna smell on your neck
Ain't nothing better then the love we have

No sofa shit, unless I bed you over it

You ain't mad watch you fold like a futon
Brown bag full of gold love coupons

[Macklemore]
Check it, now let’s get creative, mama, I made it
Been dope since Baby was kissing Wayne on Rap City: The Basement
No diss to Wayne, he’s my favorite, so stupid, write with these cadences
Looser with music like Lucifer using ultimatums
The greatest thrift shopper in the rap game, watch me
The don gotta abuse closed honkies, I’m buying sweat pants at the swap meet
Going to 106 & Park and kicking it with Rocsi
Studio’s a pita roll whenever I’m recording
I’mma be like Terrence, yo, let me borrow some Jordans
Let me wear ‘em for the weekend, if I crease ‘em where the toe is
I’m blaming Drake and Chris Brown like my bad, I’m out
Now roll in the bucket, going a hundred and bumping my own club hit
And that seven’s hitting like bumping school teachers back in the 80’s
We laid up, creating something, we make art from the heart
You can feel that in your gut and this is awesome
This coat I’m rocking, Hungarian tiger, nah, I’m lying
It’s probably just a possum, tell PETA to get the hell up off it
Man, I'm from Seattle where we show the world how to mosh pit, I’m spazzing
Ah, I messed up, looks like I’m playing these haters on the internet
Get all pumped in the comment section like no, I’m not a rapper that sucks
No, I’m just being me, something you never been good at once
Nah, listen, I’m sick, no factitious intent, I could rap better than rappers
In a fake British accent, I’m with Adele and we’re dry humping
Making out by a fence with a beautiful, big bone red head with breasts ah
Shout out to RCA, Geffen and Atlantic, Interscope, Universal
Every major left on the planet, the (producs?) gave us props
Like we’re daps and handshakes, trying to make money
Off the strength of our fan base and take a third of our merch
All that money you’re getting is reimbursed, now let’s do the math for a second
No, not now, never unless you’re giving us what we’re worth
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yeah right, this is my life, that’s like being in the cypher
And passing up on the mic, right? America, get prepared for October ninth
World Tour and our album, The Heist, BET, I’m gone

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Whoo Ha!
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K-Dot thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day
Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
I been dope since S curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
And you know any moment you can lose your life
So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
I smack 'em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
There's no assumptions
Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
(There's a dead guy on the freeway)
Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay
A beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote
But to me, it's a throw-away
I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Come again, no introduction, you know my name
Soul brother, Dueces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling
Orangutan arms banging niggas like a set
When I speak, they fucking silent like sex for the deaf
Violence, I play it like violins in the orchestra
Treat you like vitamins then spit you back out
Like a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out
Rip a page out the Almanac then cross reference when I wreck shit
I wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums
Like the measles when the record meets the needle
Heads spinning like a twelve-inch, Smoking the best Celtic
Like I shot Larry Bird, follow my word
Big Herb, Ill with it, I need a hospital gown
You need 54 cards, deal with it
You may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it
Like a bitch in the club, Shoe game

[Verse 3: Punch]
Ay yo yo, the flow potent
Who's more focused? Kick doors open
Deliver the golden opus leave with two guns smoking
It's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken
The gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship
Mind-bending, co-existing with the written
Verbal assassin, Internally smashing, Spazzing on tracks
Translation, I'm disgusting in action
A lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions
Y'all don't want nothing, The sum of all fears
Mercury rising, I'm summer all year
I sixteen 'em to death and wish them the best
I guess that's the gift and a curse, You see my pattering
Y'all still rapping like that's what's happening
I write rhymes with fire on stone tablets
Peep the malice, I'm a monster
Ya Boy running like William Joseph Crawford touche

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Straight up, Don't get ate up
Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod
Even atheists play my shit and say, "My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice"
Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up
See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stairs
That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)
I'm in the booth with an apron
Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best
Think less, You can suck my dick
Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them

What this feel like (Crenshaw at midnight)
I know I ain't call but believe I ain't far
Somewhere (Crenshaw at midnight)
Really living that life little homie think twice
Niggas shooting some dice, some niggas pull at the light
Knew em now everything alright
Car clubs and bikes (Crenshaw at midnight)

Tyga: 

[Verse 1]
Step in my Jordan 7s my kick game like Tekken
My presence ain't to be fucked with I ball like Gary Sheffield
You out like it's left field, catch a nigga, my glove real
Young kid, big wheels Daddy Dave's to Earlez Grille
Pick on my life your life shorter than an anthill
You Urkel like a Jaleel, I work, I'm worth like big bills
Pardon my drop a phantom park wherever it feels
You girl enjoy the park thrill intercourse the 'fore meal
Of course it's surreal keep it concealed take a chill pill
Barely wanting the problems cause he know he got 'em
She knows somebody he know, he know we bout it
Pop it when it get crowded enemies get surrounded
Los Angeles get lost never be founded
Greed have you on mountains lonely and now you drowning
Chill out, relax like lounges philanthropist
Enhancing advancing in larger mansions
Who pay this living insanity motherfucker

Dom Kennedy 

[Verse 2]
Some niggas in gangs and some niggas don't bang
Police be pulling us over they all just treat us the same
Never sold no cocaine but I'm as raw as they came
She told me she wanna hang I let her kiss on the chain
Told me she want a ride I told her get on the train
She just think I entertain these bitches don't know my name
For the love of the game I'm not in it for the fame
And if it don't love me back I guess I'm in it for the pay
Stress the fuck out but I just kill it with champagne
And I love driving down Crenshaw when it rain
It's a movie baby, I'm a late 80's Gucci baby
Streetwear, I fuck with Stussy maybe
Never had much though I gave niggas too many style
Don't tryin' to front though
I fuck 20 girls out the House of Blues front row
Leimert Park legend you know what's up ho

[Verse 1]
I deserve your body on my mattress
So when you ask me what I do
All I do is hurt myself
Inspiration is all I know
Inspiration is all I have
To deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress

[Hook]
What do I do now that you’re gone?
What do I do when I’m alone?
You’ve been running in my head
What do I do when I need sex?
You’re my everything
You’re my heart
You’re my everything
You’re my heart

[Verse 2]
I thought I told you
A long time ago
Don’t you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don’t you fall in love with a nigga like me

[Intro: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Hey, uh, hey, uh

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I'm walkin' in the buildin', feelin' like I own the buildin' (Okay)

All you haters so played out (Played out), y'all so 1999 (Ah)
And I'm so, “These ain't even out yet, no you can’t find these online" (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Everybody get down, I'm throwin' six thou', man, I'm sayin'
I'm rollin' six pounds and blow that shit down, man, I'm sayin'
If looks could kill, she’d have a pistol in her purse (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
One to the dome, point blank range, pow pow, she's no amateur, I get down

[Chorus: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I hit the spot the girls get get get get down

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

[Verse 2]
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Verse 3]
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)

[Outro]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin 'bout, talkin 'bout my girl
Ooh, my girl
That's all I can talk about is my girl
Why don't you believe she's all my girl
Verse 1

I'm in the party rock the short set
Spanish mommi in the corset
Go right to the bathroom to get the whore wet
Never raw sex, yes I wear the plastic honey
I'm magic Bronsonelli spending all the magic money
Keep on grinding my dick
We'll be on Facebook in 20 seconds holding knives in the flick
Shorty dancing with her tittes out
Staring at me with that pretty mouth
Yo I'm bound to dig the kitty out
Just take me back to the youth
The tommy hil guess g rock the gortex on the boot
Smelling like shoup, you see me flex in the coup
Guess I came a long way from smoking bless on the stoop
But still, never frontin little hookers with there hands out
Shorty pull your pants out, pour the water on it
Shake it off like a dog
The sour diesel fog all the fly ladies singing a song
It's bronson!!!
(Hook)

Verse 2

We got the liquor flowing heavy, piff holding steady
Shorty in the room sniffing the confetti
Well now she talking my ear off
Whisper in the ear mommi take you brassiere off and show a tit
I'm on the couch going in on a dance move
My team a bunch of criminal vandals
No sandals, high stakes, bitches hopping out the cake
Bending over, show me how the booty shake
She did a split, stop and pop it like cherokee
Moving one cheek at a time right to the melody
I wanna bite her on the back
Crumple dollar bills and throw em right up her crack
I'm going in, you peep the trim, snappy dappy dugout
Her pussy dripping yo I had to throw my rug out
Sunrise and the dicksucks and liquor pouring
Not a single motherfucker in my clique is snoring

[Intro: Rachel Taylor + (DMX)]
I... I get scared... when it comes (When it comes)
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared... when it comes (When it comes)
And I know I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
Y'all don't know things I know
Where I've been and where I go
Y'all don't know 'cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you let me be me
Y'all don't know the pain I felt
Or, how I played the cards I was dealt
Y'all don't know what you're talkin' about
Y'all need to stop runnin' your mouth

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
I get down for real, all I know is one way
Sunday to Sunday, only game is gunplay
And I know that one day, I'm gon' get it
Until I get it, I'm gon' get it
We gets it in like a fat bitch cookin'
Like a nosy bitch that's lookin'
Been had the gauge huntin', since the age 11
Niggas think you on stage, you frontin' - look here
I'm that nigga, if I knock on your door
You gon' look in my eyes and be like, "Dog, what's wrong?"
You feel it like I feel it, there's somethin' in the air
Wait, c'mere, yeah it's comin' from right there

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when you're gone
And I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
I know they love me real, so why pretend
Make a nigga take it back to where it all began
I mean, even we went

[?], yeah it's that bad
Don't let me catch you slippin', yeah I'm that mad
When the Dog do when there's no cats to chase
I'm sure there's somethin' else

[?] and try to take off his face
Yeah you was in the wrong place, at the wrong time
I'm takin' everything you got, I want it, all mine
How a nigga gon' stop me when, I don't stop for signs
Yeah you got mine, but don't start lyin'
Understand a nigga tryin', but don't stop it from happenin'
But I guess they won't GET IT, until I start clappin'

[Verse 1: KRS One]
We hit 'em and get 'em
We stick 'em and jig 'em, we pick 'em and kick 'em
Flippin' them whip and
I'm wing clippin' them lip cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and
My tribe be on a quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in 'em
Splittin' and strippin' 'em down while spittin' a round
Into them soundclash see winnin' them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them in the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' 'em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith the Clink, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, others be stealin'them

[Verse 2: Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to fuck with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go
Let's see if you can hold your breath by the time I flip to the next flow
This show is real, this is the deal, guns I'm running
Gotta make it out of town to flip my shit and keep it coming
Then bring it back with another stack of raps
To blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours?
I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night with a bunch of niggas and two mics
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my nigga Biggie

[Verse 4: Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the niggas and the bitches stay paid, fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a bitch
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the niggas from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get niggas from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo, this is for my niggas on the block all day
Who don't give a fuck waiting for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo, we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best niggas that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
Niggas coming through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Coming deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Verse 5: Cam'ron]
We destroy niggas, need advice cause I heard 'em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Making about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type
You need a dyke, baby girl, I see the light
But sometimes y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

[Verse 6: Bounty Killer]

[?]

[Verse 7: Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leaving one-third damaged
With your back cracked the Earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the Earth off the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasing motherfuckers through malls and clash in halls
Beating motherfuckers through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin' down elevator shafts
Searchin' for they ass, stayin' low in the grass
Wearing a gas mask, wrapping their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin' mad
What? Yeah yeah, suuuuu!

[Verse 8: Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with your hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her ass back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, nigga what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed that, stash the pistols

[Verse 9: Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, eEnglish, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you fuck you and that bitch on your bike
Brick City

[Verse 10: Reverand Run]
Ayo, now bust it, never try me crimey, I'm grimy, so don't deny me
I be little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(Now speed it up) Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that nigga
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

[Outro: All]
The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time, yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time, yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hot

[Intro]
Baby
Baby
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Verse 1]
Please, mercy me
Let me fall out of love, before you fuck her
I beg you
I'll give you all my pills
I'll give you all that I need, baby
I see that she is beautiful
The most beautiful by far
I see that she makes you feel good 'bout who you are
But you see how much I need you?
You see how much I care?
You see how much I care?
You see how much I care?

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I've been spendin' all my time, livin' for the thrill
All this money that I've thrown
All this liquor that I've spilled
I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress
So when you ask me what I do
All I do is hurt myself
Inspiration is﻿ all I know
Inspiration is all I have
So I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress

[Verse 3]
What do I do now that you're gone?
What do I do when I'm alone?
You've been running in my head
What do I do when﻿ I need sex?
You're my everything
You're my heart
You're my everything
You're my heart

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, I thought I told you, a long time ago
Don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Used to you
Through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Used to you
Through with you
Memory, remember you

[Verse 1]
Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'
Just playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'

[Chorus]
This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

[Verse 2]
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
"Black woman ain't got no man," that's what she said to me
Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing, I ain't racin' no fuckin' rats, I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to ya

[Chorus]
Well, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on, my nigga, one thing about it
I'm sayin' what you're seein', we tryin' to talk around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

[Intro: Rihanna]
I got my mind on my money and I'm not going away
So keep on getting your paper

[Verse 1: Brinx]
Now behold it's your excellence
C.I.T.C.O., forward slash president
East side resident, it's oh so evident
Brinx Billy ride cousin, black on black phantom, 26's on the side of em
Ninas on the side of em, goonies on the side of em
Anybody get it boy be careful on the side of them
These niggas'll bury you, guns, no serial
Money hungry honey with me when they holla she gonna carry you
Flyer than a aerial, vehicle, gerital
Sitting on my feet when I'm stuntin on them people
I tell no fables everything tailored
Fax machines, Office Max, see me for that paper
You working with short bread, ain't my money long youngin'
Bitch I'm bout trappin, more digits than a phone number
Different time zones on em, kill them niggas lyrically
Left side of my closet, look invaded by Italy
Right side Paris, left side flagging, paper is my main chick, me and money married
And that's all a nigga know bitch, that's why these brand new niggas on my old shit

[Pre-Verse: Nicki Minaj]
That's what I did I came up out the truck you what I'm mean
I chuck my deuces like that's all I do like
Young Money, Nicki Minaj, it's the ninja, Harajuku Barbie and all that
Like naa'mean, all that
We getting money, you writing disses, we getting money
Yeaaaaa boiiiiii

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Hit me my limousine, all in your magazine
And when I come, them better lean like Promethazine
Dem no seh Nicki nice, I'm bout' my money mama
And tell Michelle, I got my eye on Barack Obama
Tryna' get that Madonna, you know, Hannah Montana
Could find me sitting' Indian style with the Dalai Lama
Konichiwa I get my yen and I say sayonara
I'm meditating, I'm in cahoots with a higher power
Mind on my money, mi-mi-mind on my money yo
Mind on my money, mi-mi-mind -- Namu Myoho Renge Kyo
Mind on money, ayy, mind on my money babe
How does this money taste? Whining on moneys face
You see the signs and the teachings
If you ain't know well this is grinding season
Now go and get your gangs signs, throw it up!
Where all my niggas on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't going away
My niggas bring the heat, it's not a summer day
So find all my motherfuckin' money, my mind on my motherfuckin' money

[Pre-Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo I speak foreign languages and shit but the language I speak is that money language (laughs) flipmode bitch
Brinx I like how we do the brinx truck job on these niggas homey
Time after time again I like niggas and
Remind niggas how I hold out on motherfuckers

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Niggas out here fronting about they bread you can't trust it, nigga
My money so stupid, call me Warren Busta Buss, nigga
Glad it ain't a toss and everything about me butters
I've been counting money so Long I see dollar signs and different colors
My money is smear and smothered your money you hear me brother
Been about that bread like I was broke or still in the gutter
And in case you ain't know there will be no replacement
And them bags of Arab Money I got stashed in the basement
Face it, whenever I shine, I glisten, and whenever I talk, you listen
Ain't no money getting made in these streets without my permission
I keeps it drug-infested, my money is well connected
It's to the point my conglomerate is well-respected
You need to check my method
I promise you I be the wrong nigga when it comes to my money that you ever want to mess with
Grind like missionary labor, holding dignitary paper
You already know my team is filled with consiglieres, we made you
I don't give a fuck about your stipulation
Type of bread appropriate for every situation
You can tell by the jewelry sitting on my collar
From the bread to the crib, I know all about the dollar
‘Cause I get wetter than umbrellas
And I’m groovier than stella
I’m flyer than a flier could you get me some repeller
I I mean I need repellent t-t-taste like watermellon
I’m buying if you selling
If you lying then I’m telling

I supersize fries and the m is for Minaj
Heard you a dopeboy and I stay around your heart
I got some good pie it could get a nigga shot
So I g-g-get more eyes than the letter with the dot

Le-le-let me let me stop
Le-le-let me make it pop
You need some good box like you playing hopscotch
So let’s go and get the chalk
My Naomi Campbell walk
‘Cause I’m a bad bitch like bark

Uh Shawty I wanna know if you got hang time
And if you think that you could beat it by a landslide
Don’t lie you could see it in my eyes
I got some good cookies and I got some good pie
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

[Chorus: Bob Marley]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
I’ll be representing, representing
I’ll be representing, representing

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets
Is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness
When you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine
So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that I’m feeling a little pressure
When you’re telling me I better come get it
But I’m the man for the job
Can’t nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you
We a match made in heaven
I’ma stand right by you
While you saying

[Pre-chorus: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)

Yeah, ok, ok, ok, hey
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy?
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
(You do that and you gonna learn today)

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Ludacris]
I’ll Be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Put it down like ay
Only know you can do it
Then I’ma hit every single one of your spots
And really you don’t need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
What I’m asking if it’s mine
Cause I'mma be your motivation
Just tryna see if you can break my fucking spine
I’m so attracted, to the way you carry yourself
And keep your composure
You a lady in the street
But behind closed doors you’re a fucking soldier
A brother would never know
That’s how you like it ha
But that booty pack a mean punch
And I’ma spike it, huh, while you saying

[Pre-chorus: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
You’re incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, the rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to
I’ll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it’s not that many
You give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinning
My mind and body are gone
That jj so sublime throw it in the air and turn to sunshine
You make me wanna call the crib
And say I’m never coming home, Luda!
While you saying

[Pre-Hook: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby (Keep all your attention)

[Outro: Kelly Rowland]
I’ll be representing (I'm representing), representing
I’ll be representing (I'm representing), representing
Watch how I put it down

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids
When we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know
The days were endless
We were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining
We just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

[Chorus]
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Verse 2]
You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time
On a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking
On what you did
When you can lay back
And enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

[Chorus]
'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone
Now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Outro]
I still love you

[Intro]

You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
First of all I wanna say is free my nigga Lil
And free my nigga Rick, they gave my nigga wheels
When they told me I was locked up I was in the cell
And just thoughts of doin' life gave a nigga chills
Damn, long rise to the mountains
I heard a nigga soul make you wanna cry fountains
But you can't, 'cause your pride won't let you when you drownin' (It won't let you)
So much pain can't explain it or pronounce it (Ugh)
So you hold it like a soldier never foldin'
And daydreamin' on the day you make it home but never knowin'
When them crackers gon' let you free
Take off them chains and just let you be
Let you breathe, I get a deal (Deal), you know you get appeal
Hundred-thousand dolla lawyers rumblin' for real (Yessir)
So many laws lie fumbled in the field
Turned over to the system—either that or they was killed (Damn)
Man I dont hustle cuz I wanna, shit, I have to (I have too)
I fell in love with the streets I lost my dad too
At a early age, man I was doin' shit to lead me to a early grave
Or put me in the cage
'Cause I ain't know that the world turns slow
And time fly by you fast, tryna ride til you crash ('Til you crash)
I said I couldn't pick a side good or bad cuz bein' bad felt good and bein' good ain't get the cash
Runnin' in the streets got my mama goin crazy
Hangin' out south philly where my daddy ain't make it
Shit I was only five and I was mad I couldn't quake it
To catch a nigga slippin like a taurus transmission
Man listen, the streets that I come from black
A nigga take one of your's then you come to him strapped
With ya gat, no rappin lay em all on the floor
Squeeze the trigga and let all of em off
See look you got the fiends on the corner
Lookin' like zombies
Crack babies in the window lookin' for they mommy
Youngin' he was only 19 he got hommy
Yesterday they left him in the streets brain soggy
Cause where I'm from we die young
Ride or pride live by the gun

[Verse 1]
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

[Chorus]
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

[Verse 2]
The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

[Chorus]
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

[Outro]
We are standing on the edge

Bought a crib like scarface's

Smoking ounces to the head til my head twirls
I'm the mayor and my bitch look like a fly girl
Topic of discussion talk shit cause they bitches love us
Plus them n-ggas suckas I got that in living color
All my cars are different colors, all my broads are different colors
All I do is f-ck 'em once, and I don't call or give 'em numbers
Rolex, more sex, good weed, no stress
Run my town, arms, chest, lift weights, bowflex
Throw your set up, what you rep when you twistin' ya fingers?

Got a bank full of scrilla, a brain full of papers
Got a Taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang

Taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang
Taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang
Taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang
Taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang, taylor gang
You know I'm reppin' taylor
On my way from cali, so you know I'm smokin flavour
Aint f-ckin with blunts, you know we only smokin' paper
And I throw it up so that you know just what my name is
Muthaf-ck a haterphone full of hoes, and a gang full of taylo

[Verse 1]
Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there’s some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did alot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don’t understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the ‘burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don’t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don’t understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn’t ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me?
You know you’re Harry and I’ll always be Hermione

[Chorus]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I’m sending ain't making it through to your heart

[Verse 2]
Dear Wayne, I'm writing another letter 'cause
You never did respond, it's been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up, but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors?
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heaven's doors
Let's play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner?
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
(If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger)

[Chorus]
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart

[Outro]
I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wayne
Said I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wayne
I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wayne
I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ayne

[Intro: The Dream]
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my Macbook Air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be iChattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxson
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
I love you, girl, girl
You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you
And I just upgraded to 10-80i, hi def just for you

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never seen you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I'll type you a message for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then I load
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Bridge: The Dream]
Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind, shawty
Hey, don't care what you wear
Baby, I wanna see what's under there

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
When you seen the picture cut off the face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, would this be considered our first date?
Yay, this picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And pose in the mag like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian and be a lady addict
You know what's a crazy thing?
A girl would make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty three year old virgin
That's disrespectful, baby, don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby, you up, question mark
And she reply YES-S-S-I-R

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste

[Chorus: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
Look at me
I Just can’t believe
What they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream

[Bridge: Amber of Dirty Projectors]
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
We’re all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
I Just wanna dream
Baby, you know me

[Outro: 2Pac]
Don't support the Phoneys, Support the real
You know what I mean?
How can these people be talkin about how they so real
And they don't care about our communities?
How can they be talkin about how they're all this you know
The hood and blah blah they don't care about the communities?
You know what I mean? Listen to the words they have in their lyrics
And tell me is that some real shit
And if that's real shit to you
You know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you
Don't just bob your head to the beat peep the game
And listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it

[Intro]
(Haha)
Turn it up a lil' bit
Even more, I'm deaf as fuck (Haha)
Uh, ayy, the class clown coming soon
East End Empire
All day, all night
Let's go, let's get it

[Verse 1]
Y'all ain't doin' jack shit, just a bunch of has-beens
What the fuck happened? Why you stop rappin'?
Huh?
I'm the future, tryna ball like a hooper
Attack a beat like a cougar, rouga
Who the dude that wanna come and talk shit
I'm so fly, high up in my cockpit
The tapes comin' boy, wait until I drop it
It's some hot shit I know you gone cop it
It's like Tha Carter III mixed with The Chronic (classic)
Plus some Big L and Nas hits
I tell 'em "Watch this", start spitting out rockets
Light a beat up like your fiber optics
Pause, you ain't seen this yet kid
Resurrectin' this DMX diff
On tracks I be doin' them BMX flips
Sex chicks and move on up to the next bitch
Big like Texas, don't mess with the freshest
Yeah I spin electric, my set is the best
In the PA, country, continent, the world
Cryin lil' bitches, I ain't starting with you girls
It's Mac (It's Mac), it's Mac, jump back (Aha)
Dumb raps and my lungs is black
Uh yeah, it's Mac, say it again, yeah
Chest collapse when you takin' it in
I'm playing to win, spittin' it right
We just a couple of kids living the life
And I'm stayin' sharp like the end of a knife
And your girl come to me cause you ain't hittin' it right (Haha)

[Interlude]
Ayy that's how it go down
I don't even need a hook for this shit know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just keep on spittin' let this camera keep rollin' and shit

[Verse 2]
Lesson, if you wanna play with the kid
See don't come bullshittin' sayin' you spit
Say you, up and comin' but just buggin'
And I don't rap for the stacks, I rap cause I rap
And Mac be the cat with the haze and the dro
Games for the dough, I'm the next up to blow
Stretchin' the flows I'm that all-white, yeah
And spark mic's like a shark bite
You as bright, 'bout as bright as a car light (Haha)
And you ain't tight you just all right
I'm as nice as a calm night
Chilling with some broads, 'bout as raw as a bar fight
Cannon on me any more, the base bumpin' through the floor
Make veterans feel like they ain't did it before
I'm a black belt bitch get ya ass kicked
My weed bomb you could smell it through the plastic
Take a whiff, please all ya senses
In this rap shit they call me God's apprentice
Cause they say the kid got the hardest sentence
Feelin' like a pitch from Roger Clemens

[Outro]
That's how it go down
You know how it is, all day
Mac Miller, Easy Mac, The Jukebox
Play any beat motherfucker, I'ma murder it
Career criminal
Serial killer

[Opening Monologue]

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been gettin' old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been tryin' too hard (I been tryin' too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

[Post-Chorus]
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Verse 2]
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Bridge]
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Closing Monologue]

[Intro]
Come here girl, give me a kiss, yeah

[Verse 1]
Valentine's Day done came early
And whatever you want, girl, you deserve it
'Cause you warmer than the summer time, so I hold you through the winter time
And the love inside your eyes could turn a cloudy day to sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
I make a move then you make a move
I'm wanting your love with nothing to lose
I'm in the mood, if you in the mood
To go in the room and do what we do
It's going down
I want your body in my arms right now

[Chorus]
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
You got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone

[Verse 2]
You be my number one, tell me how you want it done
See baby, you're my favorite melody, the sound of you is heavenly
I say thank you to the heavens
As I listen to my angel sing

[Pre-Chorus]
I make a move then you make a move
I'm wanting your love with nothing to lose
I'm in the mood, if you in the mood
To go in the room and do what we do
It's going down
I want your body in my arms right now

[Chorus]
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
You got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone

[Bridge]
Ooh and nothing ever felt to so right
'Cause I never knew that a touch could taste
And a kiss could feel so good
There is nothing, there's nothing like your lips, they taste like candy
Make me wanna work to make you happy
So please put it on, I love when it's on
And I'ma kiss you 'til it's gone

[Chorus]
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know, firl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
Oh girl you got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
You got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone

[HOOK]
Everybody I know, around my way still there, (everybody still there)
Waitin' for a miracle to pass them by (by, by, by)
Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well
Yes I know them well
That's the only way they know how to survive
Cause it's the way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
It's the only way to get by, (it's the way to get by)
Cause if I had a choice aside from this life, God knows I'd try

[VERSE]
Blood stains on the concrete, and all the wall
Little snotty nose kids with guns up in their draws
You'll see it all in them project halls
I'm surprised I'm still sane with all I saw
Spoons, dirty needles, and death is on the daily
Nobody is exempt, not even little babies
We just tryna survive out here, how many really livin'?
We ain't alive out here!
Makin' it to 21 is a blessing, little homie only 12
Why the fuck is he stressing?
His mama's a crackhead, his sister's a bloodhound
His daddy's a jailbird, so he can sit full now

[HOOK]
Everybody I know, around my way still there, (everybody still there)

[VERSE]
In the same jeans everyday, hustlin' for the gwap
Day in and day out, hopin' I don't get knocked
Keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
My finger on the trigger, hand on my nine
By any means, I'm playin' for the win
Momma told me to slow it down, or I'm goin' to the pen
Fuck it, I gotta get it, it's a must
Cause it's grimey out here
Tell me, who can I really trust?
Me, and only me, I'm strapped up and on one
Niggas out here know I ain't takin' shit from no one
Little niggas, big niggas with the llamas
And anyone else who want any type of drama

[HOOK]
Everybody I know, around my way still there, (everybody still there)

Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

It never left, I just had to chill
Me and fifty one hundred niggas that will still kill
Them snakes in the grass, tryna police niggas
Say I'm livin' too large, I'm obese nigga
Eight hundred million and I cashed out
You ain't got it by now, well then you assed out
I read the blueprint, and then I ran with it
Gave it to Boo, he went and built his brand with it

Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

In position of power, so now they hear me
May not admit it, but I know these niggas fear me
Every year I grind harder than the last one
Life's short, you never know when it's your last one
Black as fuck, my girl Yellow calls us her dealers
Keep it a hundred when niggas in high can kill us
You wanna hustle, just know I supply the dealer
How you live in the jungle and you ain't a gorilla, yeah
Real niggas recognize real
Know you heard it before, I seen the blood spill
Cause in the hood, niggas dumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

Church nigga, I preach on it

Same nigga I start with, out the gutter, ate garbage
Same niggas I bought cars with, shrimp, steak, and ate marvelous
And while you playin' ball, tryna D up
I'm with Tiger Woods playin' golf, tryna tee up
Find me at the crib with my feet up
While niggas on the block, off the corner, screamin' "We up!"
This for the hood, and everybody ain't make it
There's paper out there, if you don't want it, I take it

My top down and my Loc's on, any block that I post on
Go and get my West Coast on, Louis belt with my toast on
Just came to put my folks on, guess what?
Clubbed 'em
Every time I hit the city, they screamin' out:
"We love him!"
I'm a real nigga that love real niggas
Not a hate bone in my body
In every state that I touchdown
Real niggas, they got me
It's all in my talk, it's all in my walk
It's in me, not on me
It's somethin' that can't be taught
I'm a real nigga that do real shit
Killed niggas I done killed with

[Fabolous:]
Start salutin', the director's here, start the movie
I yell "action", these young niggas'll start to shootin'
I had a dream that I'd be rich, call that Martin Lutin'
Cause bein' broke was immature, word to Marques Houston
For the top dog that once was the underdog
See him shinin' well he came from bein' under fog
One hunnid, dawg
They can't stomach, dawg
A hundred bottles last night, now here come the blogs
One nation under God, now here come the feds
Where them choppers lay 'em down, they should come with beds
If you ain't with a real nigga, then who are you with?
Keep ridin' with a fake nigga, see how far you get

This for my squad, my hood, my street, my city

Weezy home so we gonna do it like dis..

LONDON!

Uh; unreal to a close eye
Can’t feel but you heard that I’m close by

It’s more vivid the image embedded in my mind
I look around and really I see a fake smile

No time, when the tickets down
My rolex style; don’t mean shit now
Its just another paycut; my mind made up
Unnecessary lay-ups
You can still win; and got a rich and star player

Fuck a hater; still remain-a-self-made uuh
Live bigger, credit cards; no limits

I drop 20 on the luggage; took 10 minutes
I don't shop online; those are all gimmicks
Only make moves when your hearts in it
BIG said it; so I entertain like sedgwick?

Standin on the trunk; roof top; unit city
Batman, spotlight, gotta say you bitchess

The jokes on you jack
Who the fuck you gonna call when ya shit towed, by the repo

Can’t tell you girl so she the sin n folled(?)
Now you getting played like casseo’s; uuh

Casino’s, C-notes; and chips like frito’s
Got a free coat, flyin; heat throat

Most niggas only know two wordds
Like gimme those; haha; still buy em tho

Currently ballin so I gotta let you know
Flash through the tint; roll the window

Tilt the bread (?)
I did; let me see yo registration
I'mma keep it real kid; not just hating

Ain't a oppurtunity; I ain't take; close chase
City national bank; evolve into shape
Of a dollar; then I duplicate
Dont believe? motherfucker let me demonstrate
I dreamed a motherfucker tried to kill me in my sleep
Wants the point to stay; when niggas want beef
Diss me cuz they hungry; made a meal that you counldnt eat

You fucking snakes in the rat race; 2 face bitches
Thats why I dont fuck with none of yall niqqas
Cuz soon they all felt what you felt wit em
Its like puttin ’87 in a bently; nigga dont tempt me

Everything ain't everything

……………..

Uuh; I look in the sky an dI could see my good side floatin away; sellin his soul for some cheap gold

Girls choosing us; life on the tour bus; given it up; cause quick fame make you bust-a-nut

Though I despise; so black tint; cover my eyes
Hoping if I had a daughter; this topic would never be brought up

Fame-starters ; turn us all into starers
If one break away; pray the others tag along cuuuzzz

Long johns; cold world; w-w-when ya lonely
But now you got popular with 2 homies
Friends can't call you cause they say you out the country
But this is what you wanted so you gotta live in the moment

Watching every curve foot or roaches on the curb

All they do is hate; thats my fucking word-word, all they do is hate, all they do is hate, thats my fucking word

Yea; london; uuh; young money; weezy’s home!

[Hook: Fences]
Oh girl, this boat is sinking
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God, he came down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
And said nothing

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on
He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?
That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh
And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard
Yup, yup he had five a bone
When he passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hot box, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddam, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healing
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching
Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous
Room spinning
Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutching that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up
He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us

[Hook: Fences]
Oh girl, this boat is sinking
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God, he came down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
And said nothing

[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the Feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talking about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declining record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pain
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know cause he's my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit
Pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feeling like a failure
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parent's basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And "Weed's not a drug," that's denial
Groundhog Day, life repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them
We used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheating and lying
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinking I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was going to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come

[Verse 1: Sia]
A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start?
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like a deer in love lights

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Verse 2: Sia]
Did she lie and wait?
Was I bait to pull you in?
The thrill of the kill
You feel is a sin
I lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces

[Outro: Sia]
I'm falling to pieces (Falling to pieces)
Falling to pieces (Falling to pieces)
I'm falling to pieces (Falling to pieces)
Falling to pieces

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

[Chorus]
And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 3]
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

[Bridge]
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 4]
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"
Rickity-rickity-rickity-rickity-wow!
I got the golden style
You people go wild when I bless this crowd
Ooh to the ahh, to the ooh to the eee
You want to know who funky and I said 'Je suis'

Well, I give you a wedgie, I give you a noogie
Put my foot up your ass, electric boogie
Break dancing at your door on a pile of shit
Set the bag on fire for the fuck of it

I bust into your radio station, chuck a smoke bomb
Put on my gas mask and put my tape on
By the time you figure out what went wrong
Light up my jet pack and I'm gone

Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
I grab my mic and people lose their minds
And twist their hands in the air and bop their heads in time
Rockin', shoutin' (do your dance, Mike)
Because I'm built for speed like a Tour de France bike

I got the tape spinnin' in the echoplex
I keep the competition sealed under a hex
And if you waste my time then I get vexed
I'm eatin' MCs up by the dozen for breakfast

Like Franz Harary, I'm a magic man
Films in the can, cat's in the bag, carpet is shag
You can try to take the boast, but you can't take the brag

Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon

We come together upon the mic and rock it
We got styles ain't none of y'all can top it
We in the cut and, yes, we in the pocket
We're getting down and that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right...

Yo, because I'm down in the basement mixin' up ink
I'm on the edge and I'm on the brink
You've got the press, and I've got the plates
We pressin' twenties by the crate
Yes, we make it happen with the rappin'
With the crunch with the Cap'n and the Boo Berry
With Count Chocula, the sound that you love
We've been getting fly with the highest above

I'm on, the one, the battle tank in Tron
You're too far gone -- ARGH! -- another pawn
Guide searching, what channel is he on?
Cause there ain't no sunshine when Mike D's gone

Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon
Pop your balloon, pop-pop your balloon...

Yo, the sound man almost lost his soup on that one
He's still contemplating it though
Oh-oh, look out!

[Verse 1]
It’s been awhile, I’m not who I was before
You look surprised, your words don’t burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it’s clear to see
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free

[Verse 2]
Careful with your ego, he’s the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back, God knew something had to change
I thought that you’d be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad? It’s just the brand new kind of me

[Chorus]
It took a long, long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised

[Verse 3]
If I talk a little louder, if I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller, I been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different, don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me
And it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free

[Chorus]
It took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, see you look surprised

[Bridge]
If you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again
If your were worth a while, you'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry, I'm too busy finding myself
I've got this, I've found me, I've found me

[Verse 4]
I don’t need your opinion, I’m not waiting for your okay
I’ll never be perfect, but at least now I’m brave
Now my heart is open, and I can finally breathe
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me

[Intro: T-Pain]
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to a Nappy Boy Revolution
We love you baby

Ring, ring to your dome, bitch, I'm coming with a two-piece

All the lame hoes get out, bad bitches hands up
Tear up the club, we gon' leave this bitch in handcuffs
Stand up to all the real niggas
No matter what we do, we-we still niggas
So wanna ball out, and getcho fuck on
Go all out, take that slut home
We goin' in, we goin' off

Forgive me father, for I am about to sin

[Hook x2: T-Pain]
The champ is here, the champ is here
Middle fingers up, get amp in here
I'm back bitch, I'm a G

[Verse 2: Tay Dizm]
Riding round in my Chevy, blowing on that fire
Bitch, I don't play games, what the fuck you think I'm 'bout
I be chillin' with my niggas, we all on that bud ice
Fuck around if you want to, get hit in the head with that bud ice
No, I ain't no pussy, all day I be dinnin'
I don't play no games, all day I be winnin'
I stay beamed up, set high, old school is what I'm whipping
Had a 12 pack, got 11 more ridin' round and I'm sipping one
Got your bitch up in my 

[?] some of y'all niggas be slipping
She calling me the captain 'cause my dick is just ridiculous
They mad at me, my money getting thicker
Y'all niggas stay broke, NappyBoy get richer
Dizm this, Dizm that, all I hear is Dizm now
What's up? Big talk? Nigga, you know what I'm 'bout
Nothing but the truth, what I got the life on
Right hand up in the air, left hand up on the Bible
So, now you know

[Hook x2: T-Pain]
The champ is here, the champ is here
Middle fingers up, get amp in here
I'm back bitch, I'm a G
Hail Mary, follow me

[Intro]
Yeah
Aw-wah-aw-wah, ugh!
Nappy Boy!
Ahahah! Yeah!
Ugh!

[Hook]
These niggas tryin' to be black Bill Gates (Gates!)
But what they can't see (See!)
Is Bill Gates tryin' to be the white version of me
Ain't that a bitch? (Ain't that a bitch? Ain't that some shit?)
Ain't that a bitch? Man, I just wanna get rich
So I can see my niggas live (Live) and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position
So you know that I know that's a bitch (Ain't that a bitch)
Ain't that a bitch (Ain't that some shit?)
Man, I just wanna get rich, ain't that a bitch?
Man, how'd you wanna get rich?
And I can see my niggas live and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position
So you know that I know that's a bitch

[Verse 1]
Smoking on this technology
My presence is a present, you ain't gotta acknowledge me
Don't matter how I gotta get it, even robbery
It's black mask on you motherfuckers like it's Halloween
Follow me bitch I'm all that
You gotta be kidding, that big dog with that small cat
I'm the dean, I got a permanent hall pass
So when you see me in the hall, you better haul ass
F-F-F-Fall back, all my watches is wrong
Three hours late to the Grammys, you can watch me at home
My 808s a gracious taste like a Glock to the dome
Ten thousand dollar suit, you think I was mocking Capone
These people hate the truth if you don't believe in that
Then why the paparazzi don't give a fuck where I'm eating at
Cause you know real niggas ride and wack niggas hate
So then you realize

[Hook]
These niggas tryin' to be black Bill Gates
But what they can't see
Is Bill Gates tryin' to be the white version of me

And I can see my niggas live and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position so you know that I know

Man how'd you wanna get rich
Ain't that a bitch? Man, how'd you wanna get rich?
And I can see my niggas live and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position so you know that I know
That's a bitch

[Verse 2]
Ugh, I-I got good news and bad news
The bad news is that the good news is sad news
B-B-But the good news is you finally gettin' what you wished for
But everybody wished they can get shit they don't do shit for
So what makes you so different? Is this what you deserve?
I've been eatin', I've been eatin', I'm not ready for dessert
Tires screeching, tires screeching; man, I'm finna hit the curb
I believe it, I've been reading, I take in the good word
Praise the Lord, nigga; you got me!
All these candy yours, nigga; houses and Bugattis!
Y-Y-You doin' bad, hoe? D-D-D-Do better!
You tryin' to get this bread, bro? Bruschetta!
My mindframe is boss-boss-boss, that's on everything I get on
Make a fucking throne out of anything I sit on
You niggas look like toilets, I prepare to get my shit on
You keep pissing me off, you gon' get pissed on, yeah!

[Hook]
These niggas tryin' to be black Bill Gates (Gates!)
But what they can't see (See!)
Is Bill Gates tryin' to be the white version of me
Ain't that a bitch? (Ha, ain't that a bitch? Ain't that some shit?)
Ain't that a bitch? Man,  I just wanna get rich
And I can see my niggas live (Live)
And watch them haters die slow (Die slow)
I used to be in your position so you know that I know
That's a bitch (Ha, ain't that a bitch? Ain't that some shit?)

Ain't that a bitch? (Mm-mm) Man, I just wanna get rich
And I can see my niggas live, and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position so you know that I know
That's a bitch

[Pre-Hook]
I feel so much better
I know I said I'll never, ever drink again
But now I feel like I never had before
I get out on the floor
And show them what it's for

[Hook]
Can I get that 'Tron? Can I get that Remy?
Can I get that cold? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?
Can I get that 'Tron? Can I get that Remy?
Can I get that cold? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?

[Verse 1]
Can I get that
When I walk up in the club, I hit that
Shawty wanna break me off like a k-k-k-Kit Kat
Get a couple bottles and a couple models and I wanna sip that
'Tron, when I'm in the zone
Can I get that Henny when I’m already in it?
Can I get that margarita when I’m chilling with a mamacita?
I'ma see you later on tonight
I know, I said I should stay in my bed
I’m in the club instead party-rocking with my baby
So now I’ll never say never
She’ll leave me if I let her
That’s why I gotta keep her on the dancefloor and tell her

[Pre-Hook]
I feel so much better
I Know I said I’ll never ever drink again, again, again
But now I feel like I never had before
I get out on the floor and show them what it's for

[Verse Two: Pitbull]
I'm ready for whatever, whenever, y'all know the game
It's Mr. Throw-a-Bone & Pain, y'all know the name
Didn't go to private school, but now it's private planes
And we stay around the world in hotels under private names
Bartender, give me a Voli-water-lime
Put your drinks in the air, it's Voli time
Everybody rap about vodka
Only difference is, this low-cal, and Voli's mine
I don't mean to brag, so don't think wrong
As a matter-fact, Pain, let's get our drink on
Mama over there named Judy
And she got a tutti-frutti juicy booty you can put a drink on
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Know what that means? They ain't drinking
These type of things happen all the time
You better get yours, 'cause I'm gon' get mine, dime

[Verse]
How did my money go my cash I don't know
I crash with bad times I'm run in bad luck
I'm down to my last 3 dollars and nobody wanna holla when you sitting on the bottom
I need new shoes and my baby need bottles
Anything for that change I be out here for a throttle
Riding and broke and tryin' to come up on this game
It's over the love of the green I be bosted on the scroll with them dough finge late night
Fried jay Glock super hot like a bench pipe
I tried to turn the other cheek but they gon' kick me on my creek if I laid another week
So I picked up the phone and called the dope man and tell them that I need my supply
So I can get back to what I used to I got a hole in my pocket like a fruit loop

[Hook]
There's a hole in my pocket where my money should go
There's only 25 cent of a hundred I know
And I had so much money before
But now there's a hole in my pocket where my money should go

[Bridge]
Sang it with me there was a hole in the ground
The most troubling hole that you ever seen
But I had so much money before
There's a hole in my pocket where my money should go

[Verse]
Here I roam for one more
Sometimes I feel like I'ma never get apart from broke
And keep a job so back to the streets to go
Worry about the rent tryin' to get up out this hole
I'm tired of living this life so this time I got my mind made up
No more bullshit and time to man up
I'm tryin' to have a better life
Big nice house for the kids and the wife
And get my mama that benz and get my sister that jag
And get my brother that donk and get my daddy that lamb
'Cause I'm tired of being broke tired of living hard
Tired of worrying about gas money for the car
Sometimes I wanna let go but I got a gang control
And get a grip and never let go
Straight forward it's time it's time to get dough
It's a hole in my pocket where my money should go

[Hook]

[Verse]
9 to 5 just went to hell
Every cousin I got is in jail
I know, (I know) I gotta do better (I gotta do better)
Time to get off my ass, get this money but not too fast
'Cause I know that it's so possible to burn a hole in my

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 1 (T-Pain)]
Things ain't looking good
Seems like there's nowhere to go except where I am right now
Trying to get up out this hood
Need to go somewhere I know, some people showed me how
To make things better, I know its possible
Even in stormy weather, it feels good to know

[Hook]
You wish everything was up and up
But its going down down down
Down down
It might seem like I don't care enough
That's why I don't come around round round
And I keep my ass where I'm supposed to be down there
I keep my ass where I'm supposed to be down there (x2)

[Verse 2 (Skye)]
Now enough is not enough
I ask myself what I'm doing here still
I can't believe its this hard to leave the ground
When that is all I sing about, my god
But who is gonna save me now?

[Hook]

[Verse 3 (T-Pain)]
All the sudden everything went southbound
And don't nobody wanna open up their mouth now
Cause they don't wanna offend their family or friend
I guess it all just depends whose fault this shit really is, right?
Who invented this way of doing things?
My mind racing, I feel like I'm doing 2 a day
Understand this what it take for a man
To stop him from fucking up whenever his leg is up

[vocal scratches]
That's what's up

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
See once upon a time there was a girl
That fell in love with a boy
And he watched the news while she was cleaning his shoes every day
See I wish we lived in a perfect world
Cause for this boy and this girl
Their relationship sucked, they never ever made love
They barely talked to each other
But you would think they were the perfect couple
Not knowing that they both been living double
They go out to eat and every time that they meet they'd get along
Sit down and then they talk and even smile
Cause nobody knows all the while
At the end of the night they gonna get in a fight when they get home

[Hook]
And that's why I, wish that I could live in a fairytale
Cause everyday would be so good
But when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could (oh), if I could
And I would kill myself if I could
Cause when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could

[Verse 2]
See once upon a time there was a man
Who was in love with a lady
They went on morning walks and they would talk and talk
'Bout how they are happily married
One day that man went on a ride
And had a girl in his passnger side
Then the lady saw him and she tried to call him
But she ain't get no answer
She leaving voicemails, texting
Cause all she can think about is him and the girl sexing
The best thing to do is follow him to the spot
And she gon' kick the door in if he like it or not
So the lady (lady), went crazy (crazy)
She said, "How can you do this to me baby?"
She told him to go 'head and stay with the girl he with
But he better pack his shit when he get home

[Hook]
And that's why I, wish that I could live in a fairytale
Cause everyday would be so good
But when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could (oh), if I could
And I would kill myself if I could
Cause when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could

[Verse 1]
I put my trust in a woman that got no trust in me
Cause I'm in love with her she's in lust with me
I can't go on without any control
She's got a grip on my love, superho
And mama told me there'd be days like this
She didn't tell me this woman would have my heart in her fist

[Hook]
She put the wool over my eyes
Get away, get away I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I said goodbye

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm looking kinda like a fool
And I tried to get away
Tried to get away but no matter what I knew
Man she keeps on pulling me back to that hell she calls her home
The way she's treating me deceiving me I'd rather be alone

[Hook]
She put the wool over my eyes
Get away, get away I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I said goodbye

[Verse 3]
If there's anything I've learned
It's probably nothing at all
And this woman will still be the death of me
She's got my heart , my mind, my body and soul and all
And I heard through through the grapevine
She's working on the rest of me, good God!

I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I say goodbye

[Outro]
I know it's a man out there going through the same thing
Let me hear you say
I know it's a man out there going through the same thing
Let me hear you say
Wool over my eyes

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
One day I woke up and everything around me was broke up
Family couldn't handle me so I go smoke up
And go right back at sleeping dream about bringing my folk up
Without the chocker, oh oh
Was I even ready for the hand I was dealt
Was I even ready to the man that I be felt
Gotta get on my grind let me tighten in my belt
Spit this shit from my heart make the microphone melt
I grew up in the area where ain't nobody scared of ya
But when you hit the club niggas watch and niggas scared as fuck
Don't nobody wanna be here but they ain't got no choice
And er'body wanna be heard without a voice
If you don't speak up I can't hear over these speakers
I did what I had to do and I'm rocking double rolls royce
But I wouldn't have it if it wasn't for the streets
And these motherfucking beats

[Hook: T-Pain]
Man I held it in for too long I miss my city
And all the motherfuckers that used to be cool with me
I was born and raised
Made in pain, lost in the game, insane
In the streets dollar after dollar I'm spending
I never can forget out the beginning
Cause nigga I was born and raised
Made in pain, lost in the game, insane
In the streets

[Verse 2: Young Cash]
I never worked a 9 to 5 what do it feel like
I run these streets getting money crutching that street tight shit
So listen close cause all I tell is the ghetto stories
Cause niggas die for nothing so that stick is mandatory
Cause in the projects is no love, no heat, no rub
Ain't tryin' to be doctor and no lawyers just more thugs
And they ain't tryin' to buy the kids books just more drugs
Tell them their future ain't right, they be like "so what? "
But who am I to try to point the finger
Cause I done sold everything under the sun that y'all niggas can think of
And no regret all because the streets saved me
But Lord knows this ain't the road that my mama paved me
You get tired of looking over your shoulder
You get tired of your mama crying over and over
You gotta take the bad with the good though
Yeah I made it out, but I'm still in the hood though

[Hook: x2]

[Intro: Fast Eddie & Wiz Khalifa]

[?]
Fast Eddie, Mac Miller, Wiz Khalifa, nigga (Yeah)
Turn this shit the fuck up, nigga (Uh)
You know how we fuckin' do
Live from the 412 (Uh)
Crazy 8’s, bitch

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Late nights, chillin', money stackin' to the ceilin'
Up a couple hundred, tryna get it to a million
Rosé spillin', already high but I'm good weed twistin'
Niggas got game thanks to me, no need to mention
Automatic start, no keys when I enter
Them youngins take notes
These hoes take pictures, jaunt me at my shows
Wanna see if I know 'em off Twitter
I'm sorry, baby, it's highly unlikely like me in some Nike's
Get money every day, I'm poppin' bottles nightly
Louie be carry on, I travel lightly
Promoters throw me OZ's, they think of us highly
If I'm in it that mean it's custom prolly
Plus my ho exotic, smokin' kush that come from Cali
The best in it
Come to that shit, don't question it
You know I got it
Say they tired I get it streets but they've been waitin' for it
Just left the dealer so that's prolly what they hatin' for
Uh, look at the wrist, they got me taken for it
When they walk, money talks, I just can't ignore it
See a piece of pie and think how I could make it more
My cake enormous, my paper gorgeous

[Chorus: 

[?], Wiz Khalifa, Mac Miller & Fast Eddie]
Come live in the town with me
Baby, take a ride with me (Believe that)
I can see us goin' places (Haha)
Every night we're goin' places
Different cities, different faces
I know that we're goin' crazy
We're so high I can't breathe (Mac Miller; y'all happy to see me?)

[?] (Live from the 412)
I can see us goin' places (Fast Eddie Productions)
Every night we're goin' places
Different cities, different faces (Aight, look)
I know that we're goin' crazy (Hey)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Now they know my name so no repeatin' since the day I started breathin'
It's been good, I'm only cheefin' and my bitch is Puerto Rican
Grindin', never sleepin', eatin' like I'm Kel and Kenan
Every weekend party all damn night but then I sleep in
We've been gettin' this money since we was youngins, bruh
I'm gettin' cake, you losin' weight just like a tummy tuck
You see me comin' up, hit you like an uppercut
The 'Burgh great tend to win the race and you the runner-up
I got a little success but I ain't done enough
Jumpin' like a double duck, these haters lookin' dumb as fuck
My weed the precious, all my bitches come with bubble butts
Goin' on a ride, y'all should buckle up
I'm gettin' pussy, you the ugly duck
Swimmin', sinkin' in the pool
Makin' money, why the fuck I need to finish school?
Now they see me and they greet me, "Is it really you?"
All around the world, you see the visuals

[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

[Bridge]
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Kendrick Lamar, Both]
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

[Chorus]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"

[Outro]
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Skit]
Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!

[Intro]
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said, "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
"Where you stay?" She said, "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" "No," she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, "What you tryna get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?"
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

[Outro]
Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!

I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)

Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

[Outro]
Kendrick’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!
Kendrick’s Dad: Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass
Kendrick’s Mom: See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain’t even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
Kendrick’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—

[Part II: Produced by Terrace Martin]

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

[Scratches]
​m.A.A.d city
Compton

[Outro]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that

[Part I: "Sing About Me"]

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 

[Gunshots]

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

[Part II: "I'm Dying of Thirst"]

[Skit]
(On the phone)
"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time."
"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga."
"Bring a nigga back a black!"
"Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
"Bring a nigga back a black!"
(*Hangs up*)
"Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now."
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say "fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works."

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins."
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe that Jesus is Lord."
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
"I believe You raised Him from the dead."
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life."
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
"And be my Lord and Savior."
(And be my Lord and Savior)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward."
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood."
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus' name, amen."
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

[Skit: Kenny Duckworth]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Skit: Kenny Duckworth & Paula Duckworth]
Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what y'all need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

[Bridge: Anna Wise]
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you

[Skit: Paula Duckworth]
"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
"Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God
(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I shine so bright I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this motherfuckin' block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Mama, take this motherfuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Men lie, wo- women lie
Men lie, wo- women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I don't give a fuck about being famous
I wasn't supposed to be a star
And no one ever told me there'd be nights like these, no
I just wanna smoke with my friends in the park
Like we used to
Now I'm drivin' down Melrose
Shit is really kinda feeling like a hell-hole (And I don't know)
Where did all my friends go?
Tell me, where did all my friends go?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
This is what you listen to in the Marauder, uh
When you don't give a fuck about anything, yeah
This is what you listen to in the Marauder
This is the soundtrack to the game, game, game

[Post-Chorus: blackbear]
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2: blackbear & Mike Posner]
I don't need a Rolls Royce or a Bentley, no, naw
'Cause none of my heroes had those
I wonder if I'm s'posed to do like them and die young, oh
'Cause now I'm someone else's hero
(I drive slow) And now I'm drivin' through my hometown
The one that every time I go, I always hold down (Every show)
And now it's feelin' like a ghost town
Why's it feeling like a ghost town? (Woo)

[Chorus: Mike Posner & blackbear]
This is what you listen to in the Marauder (In the Marauder), yeah
When you don't give a fuck about anything, anything
This is what you listen to in the Marauder (In the Marauder), uh
This is the soundtrack to the game, game, game (Oh, yeah)

[Hook]
Why do fine girls always have attitudes?
You say one thing wrong, they get mad at you
You try and loosen them up with a glass or two
Why do fine girls always have attitudes, attitudes, yeah

My friends back home, always ask me:
"Mike, why you date no supermodels?"
Well, the truth is that they're too damn skinny and
Always order big ol' bottles, of Cristal, fuck that
No necklaces, I got a one track mind
They can't figure out why
Somebody tell me

[Hook]

My friends back home always ask me:
"Mike, why you date no actresses?"
Well, I banged a few, but all they ever do is
Talk 'bout being actresses
And I don't care, about your job
Who your co-star is, go suck his cock
Cause it doesn't make a difference to me, no
I need a down chick

[Casey Veggies]
A long flight, she was in the middle
Met a model chick on the plane
She was thinkin' 'bout gettin' some sleep and
I was thinkin' 'bout gettin' some brain
I was starin' all at her ass when I forgot to ask her name
That's a shame, I'm a dog, need to be tamed, gimme a call
Said her favorite song last year was "Blame It On that Alcohol"
At the bar, before the flight, gettin' shots, feelin' right
At the end of the day, she realize I'm a young nigga just livin' life
You get it right, I spend a stack or two
Her attitude determine latitude, like, (like, like, like)

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo drop to the ground and one knee me if you see me
Take off your top like ZZ
Mushrooms by himself causes shown to give samples of the body
That I demolished you novice I'm polished
Dip in impala quick
Ah motherfucker your only kinda sick
I'm fully blown like Tom Hanks in Philadelphia
I'm out for self-ia, Bronson not helpin' ya
Trying to get the Lexus ah oysters for breakfast ah
I'm still in queens thats my native land
I sport a headdress baby veil on the headrest
Bitch
Buscemi frame by my favorite chair
Asian hair on a dominican with cajun flare
I keep the coke clean, father and son dope fiends
Mother and daughter strippers sniffing all the codeine
Affliction shirts and dress paints like I'm Oakley
Three bitches waiting for me Toyki oh shit
Roll whip, panamera rough
Salamander tux, fucking Alabama Butts
Ah we known to galavant in trucks
With an Irish bitch that will put a fucking hammer to your nuts

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]

Compose a fly rap with an 18 karat meisterstuck
My people like to shoot
Bronsolino dice the fluke
Phenomenal fish platters
Plus everyday is turkey day
My vision is clear so now we getting it the murky way
Pillaging daily plus we give thanks and fill tanks with premium
Cadillacs my people always steaming them
Turn the car into a sauna with some marijuana
If you know Bronsolino then you know thats his persona
Slang school PHd holders in the building
Far from elementary but we do this for the children
Ready able and willing
Dealing constantly building
Seen niggas make a million standing outside they building
I'm from New York home of the hustle
Where skinny people move big cuz chrome is the muscle
Just to get a rep you get left with a darker past
You just a little sick my fucking flow is Arthur Ashe

[Intro]
You know I have to be honest
It's like, for the first time in my life my pride is not involved
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to tell you girl, girl I love you
Believe that and if I can't have you, I don't know what I'ma do, listen to me

[Verse 1]
So many people never find the one, that's why I really wanna tell you something
I really think this is it for me, I really think you're the one I need
'Cause baby I done had 'em all and I don't want nobody but you
Now darling

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey let me break it down, see we living in a lonely world
Ain't you tired of the running round, don't you wanna be my only girl?
Baby, can I be the one you call when you tired of the lies?
And the truth is all you wanna hear, well if you swear

[Chorus]
Baby, here I am, I'm your man
I came with everything you needed, you and me are undefeated
'Til the end of time, one mind, one heart, one love
All you gotta do is
Take my hand, we will stand
This was made to last forever, so let's say it together
For the rest of time, one mind, one heart one love
Oh listen baby

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I'm worth, from my head down to my shoes
And girl if we gon' work, then I need the same from you
I know that so many other dudes cheat, but so many dudes ain't me
Give me my pick girl, hand it down and I'll pick you girl every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna break it down, see we living in a lonely world
Ain't you tired of the running round, don't you wanna be my only girl?

For the rest of time, one mind, one heart one love

So I was lost, go count the cost
Before you go to the Holland Road
With your heart like a stone you spared no time in lashing out
And I knew your pain and the effect of my shame
But you cut me down, you cut me down

And I will not tell the thoughts of hell
That carried me home from the Holland Road
With my heart like a stone and I put up no fight
To your calloused mind, and from your corner you rose
To cut me down, you cut me down

So I hit my low, but little did I know
That would not be the end
From the Holland Road
Well I rose and I rose and I paid less time
To your calloused mind, and I wished you well
As you cut me down, you cut me down

But I still believe though these cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you believe in me I'll still believe
But I still believe though these cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you believe in me I'll still believe

Love rocket

[Verse 1]
‘Cause I know that time has numbered my days
And I’ll go along with everything you say
But I’ll ride home laughing, look at me now
The walls of my town, they come crumbling down
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask

(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

[Bridge]
Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down
Well, I’m gonna tear, tear them down

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask

[Verse 1]
You hold your truth so purely
And swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved
Under this sun!
Under this sun!

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Outro]
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head; let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young

[Verse 1]
You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
And broken glass saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Verse 2]
So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Bridge]
But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals (next to yours)
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours (on the coals)

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold with all of my might (as long as you like)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Outro]
Ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life
And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over

I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

[Hook]
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up -- breathe in, breathe out

[Hook]

And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

[Hook] x2
Well love was kind
For a time
Now just aches
And it makes me blind
This mirror holds
My eyes too bright
I can't see
The others in my life

Were we too young
Our heads too strong
To bear the weight
Of these lovers' eyes
Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse
Of these lovers' eyes

[Hook]
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
Cause there's no drink
Or drug I've tried
To rid the curse of
These lovers' eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong

[Hook]
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes

And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way

And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way

And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
Don't let me darken your door
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for

And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong

[Hook]
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't fade away

So watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart

And your lights always shining on
And I been traveling oh so long
I been traveling oh so long

[Hook]
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't' fade away

Oh my love don't fade away
You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name

So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start

[Hook]
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

[Hook]
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under
Touch my mouth and hold my tongue
I’ll never be your chosen one
I’ll be home, safe and tucked away
You can’t tempt me if I don’t see the day
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
Stifles the choice and the air in my lungs
Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
Cause when I open my body I breathe a lie
I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot
And oh, my heart was flawed I knew my weakness
So hold my hand, consign me not to darkness

So crawl on my belly ‘til the sun goes down
I’ll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace

So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I can take the road and I can fuck it all away
But in this twilight, our choices seal our fate
You were cold
As the blood through your bones
And the light which led us from our chosen homes
Well I was lost

And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost

[Hook]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

And I was still
But I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus all was well
For all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
Wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

[Hook x2]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

[Verse 1]
Your eyes they tie
Me down so hard
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love
My candle bright
Learn me hard, oh learn me right
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
Though I may speak
Some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength
From which to speak
When you sit me down, and see I'm weak

[Hook]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

[Verse 2]
So as we walked
Through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke
I was on my knees
But you said yes as I said please
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
I leave no ties
For a cynics mind

[Hook]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams
And we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away

[Verse 3]
Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
And I will love with urgency but not with haste

[Intro: T-Pain]

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I keep seeing niggas tryin' to be my duplicates
Running round acting like they be the poop and shit

This beat is so thick look like it already done had kids
So put this in your speaker box
Call it an old school prank, cause this nigga knocks

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I-dada mean, Molly is my medicine
My mind, my dream, have her looking elegant
My highlight is goin' fly by my wi-dife
And hoin' my life is triumph for no one but that's irrelevant
I'm tryin' to party, bitch I ain't the president
I don't swat flies, cause bitch I am an elephant
I'm in the party like dada-dada
Drinking with N.O.R.E. you know we got nadda fama
But I peace for sex and, she's my best friend
If she sleeps with Tech then keep a heap of cheques in
My pad your lady give me money ain't my bad
Your problem, cause you wifed a bitch in the ho column
And I'm happy the morning after, smashed her
Beat it up hella quick like I was Master IP
Dip to my crib and I stash a grip
Banging this beat I love it cause this a blapper bitch

[Verse 1]
You're hard to find even when your heart is mine
Give you my heart and mind as well
Invisible girl
You're hard to know but I can't let you go
You're so invisible to me
Invisible girl you are
Invisible girl you are to me
Invisible girl you are

[Hook]
I see right through your lies
Your so transparent and translucent
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl
Look in your eyes I know you're used to always losing
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl

[Verse 2]
You're hard to love and even harder to see
And so invisible to me
Invisible girl I love you
And I see you
I love you ,...to me
Invisible girl you are

[Hook]
I see right through your lies
Your so transparent and translucent
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl
Look in your eyes I know you're used to always losing
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
You didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool

So welcome to the machine

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine

[Synthesizer Solo]

[Outro]

[Intro]
Oooh

[Verse 1]
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you

[Chorus]
But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

[Verse 2]
Ooh (Soon)
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I (I, I) can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

[Chorus]
But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Tell you, it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

[Bridge]
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me"
Or I will surely die, hmm
(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

[Chorus]
(Just my imagination) Once again
Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

[Outro]
I’ve never met her but I can't forget her
(Just my imagination) Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runnin' away with me, ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
She's never hard to find (Just my imagination)
She's always on my mind (Runnin' away with me)

[Verse 1]
I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

[Hook]
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer you would be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved some one else

[Hook]
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind

[Verse 3]
People say believe half of what you see
Oh, and none of what you hear
I just can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

[Hook]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said, son

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone)
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone)
(Papa was a rolling stone) my son, yeah
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone)
Well, well

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards, Melvin Williams and Richard Street]
Hey momma
Is it true what they say that papa never worked a day, in his life
And momma, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
I heard them talking papa doing some store front preachin'
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Momma just hung her head and said

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone) my son
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone) hey
(Papa was a rolling stone) dadgummit
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)
(And when he died) all he left us was (alone)
Uhh!

[Verse 3: Damon Harris and Richard Street]
Hey momma
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey momma
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

[Chorus]
(Papa was a rolling stone) well well well well
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) hey yeah huh
(And when he died) all he left us was alone lone lone lone alone
(Papa was a rolling stone) huh huh huh huh huh huh
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) hey yeah
(And when he died) all he left us was alone
I say yeah

[Hook]
(Papa was a rolling stone) yes he was
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home) huh huh huh
(And when he died) all he left us was alone
My daddy was
(Papa was a rolling stone) yes he was hey yeah
(Wherever he laid his hat was his home)

[Outro]
Ahhhh ha ha

[Intro: Eminem]
Slim motherfuckin' Shady
A'ight
Missy Elliott, Timbo, c'mon, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm homicidal and suicidal, with no friends
Holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' TECs at you until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' at the couch
Jumped out of the ninety-third floor of a buildin'
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (Keep filmin'!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half and suffocated your oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher I'ma get the East and West beefin' again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Interlude: Ken Kaniff]
Oh fuck. Oh shit. I got the hotel room ready. What time are you getting off... work? Or shall I say... what time are you coming home.

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A'ight, yo, yo, yo
One more time, yo
I'm only smilin' when I'm violent, got on a plane wylin'
Told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island (Now)
Stewardess like, "You restless?" "Nah, bitch, I'm restful
Just hold this fuckin' jet still so I can eat these pretzels"
Forget school, the other kids are disrespectful
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles (Leave me alone)
I can't take it, I'm tryin' to gain weight, so I eat steak
Swallow the whole plate and weigh myself naked (

[?])
Put out albums to teach kids family values
'Cause every mom and dad should allow you to pop Valiums
And never hit someone unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason, make one up, start swingin'

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Same city, yeah, we can’t break up
Nice mask on, I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment – what’s the matter?
She’s learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I don’t blame her, my mind is gone
I’m at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I don’t hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs
It goes on and on
Don’t wanna break you, but I’m leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it’s gone

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Refrain: Buffalo Madonna]
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It’s over
Over

[Bridge: Buffalo Madonna]
Didn’t believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I’m on the homie’s couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can’t live without her
Now you’re paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain’t like you alone
Haven’t made love with the lights still on
It’s like you’re hiding something from me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let’s fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin’, staring into those two eyes
And I can’t take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let’s keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love – maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to God, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I’ve been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I’m leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it’s so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

[Bridge: Macklemore & Buffalo Madonna]
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
Love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Refrain: Buffalo Madonna]
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over
To my fans

I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy

Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The 'Rolling Stone' video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence pieces of clothing off at every shot). The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist

This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to 'Trilogy'. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint

Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XO

I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say thirty's the new twenty
And twenty's the new thirty, shit I guess
Makes sense, 'cause fifteen-year-olds seem twenty
And twenty-five -year-olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basehead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, who's got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
If cynical hispters with long hair
And cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
They say, "It's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth"
The guns - that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less conscious
Than rappers rapping 'bout them strippers up on a pole, popping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that "It’s poetry, you’re so well spoken," stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there's a new Rodney on YouTube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet "R.I.P Trayvon Martin"
Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching
Fighting for a freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
"But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talking race, trying to save the fucking globe?"
Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's 1999
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Outro: Evan Roman]
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

[Verse 1]
I hope that God decides to talk through 'em
That the people decide to walk with 'em
Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right outta your lungs
And those words be the oxygen—just breathe
Amen, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm payin' rent
'Bout damn time that I got out of my basement
'Bout damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours, I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell, David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

[Chorus]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today, all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparrin' with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him
Celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage, I'm actually workin' on leavin', see
I observed Escher
I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring
You see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great because they'd paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme
I make my livin' off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system
What'd you expect?
Generation of kids choosin' love over a desk
Put those hours in, and look at what you get
Nothin' that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

[Chorus]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 3]
Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it
No light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute
Bangin' on tabletops, no subs to toot
I'm feelin' better than ever, man what is up with you?
Scrapin' my knuckles, I'm battlin' with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

[Bridge]
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show, it all fades away
Lights go to black, band leaves the stage
You wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

[Outro]
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Liquor all night, love it
Untamed youths, the Coupes moves like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drank
Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wyling and all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word
We all in together, now we off it
Cops be buggin', shotguns on the whip
Fuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggy
You can catch me high, it's all good, no Biggie

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yeah
Yeezy
Ugh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Wylin' cuz I'm young, I be wylin' cause I'm young
She be wylin' cause I'm hung, they be violent where I'm from
Fee, fi, fo fum, bitches so dumb
On a balcony making out with me, like she so drunk
Got me feeling like a damn hunk
Headed home I'm bout to slam dunk
Pray to the box of mags, protect me when I'm old
Pop a few Vi-rags, resurrect me
Geezer, Ebenezer
Grab titties, prob'ly catch a fucking seizure
But keep a big ass crib with a theater
Remind me of my money when I catch amnesia, oww!

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Rage, 'cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no mo' bitches playin possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, when a women with some toes
Optimos, takin trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high, go with ya soul and try floatin through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and mimosas
Costa Rica, next on the agenda

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
Wild'n cuz I'm young, wil-wild'n cuz I'm young
I be wild'n cuz I'm young, I be wild'n cuz I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chill and old
Is the cup half empty?
Or is the cup half full?
Does the sun rise at dawn?
Or does the earth just spin along?
Or is it all perspective?
On how we see the world?
How many countless life forms
Are on a little ball that twirls?

Are we intrinsically separate beings?
Or could we possibly be parts of the same thing?
Water feeds the plants and
The sunshine makes them grow
So how can anyone be an island on their own?

Does life life make me happy?
Or does it bring me down?
Do I have what I need?
Or do I just want what's around?
Am (am) I (I) seeing truth?
Or do I just see wool?
Well is the cup (cup) half (half) empty?
Or is the cup half full?

[Verse 1]
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

[Verse 2]
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall

When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

[Bridge]
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall
Hello
I'd like to make a special special dedication
To all them special special people
That did all them special special thanks
Especially the Native Tongues and KRS
Can't forget Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh
A big shout-out to Freestyle Fellowship
Let me do this

Hook:
Let's do this for the people
Let's make our mommas proud
Let's do this for the people
Let's do, let's do it now

[Will.i.am]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
Before I had status & a two way pager
You could find Will listening to A Tribe Called Quest
Their Low End Theory made me wanna do this
You see you gotta understand that things go in cycles
Justin Timberlake is just a new form of Michael
It's called inspiration
That's the way it be
Without the Jay Dees there probably wouldn't be no Peas
So I'm a do this for those that inspired me to be
And motivated me to start my legacy
I give a shout- out to my man Eazy-E
A big R.I.P. cause he believed in me (yeah)
He put me down back in 1993
And now I grab the mic & rock the party
I got Joints & Jams for peabodies
And peabodies is short for family
They're my people
Hook (x2)

[Taboo]
Raise up the heat
Let me blow up this track
I gotta pay homage to my peeps way back
Had a little dream hungry run rap game
And now the dreams are same but the game is changed
Back in '88 before I was great
I used to battle on the block as a b-boy & break (yeah)
Heavy while of course I used to water the bush
Used to leave fools' crews down & black & blue
Hip hop kept on at the Kiba Lawn
Ballistics & unity it all was the bomb
Blew up the spot when my mic was on
It was a good life, foundation, feelin was strong
I kept on (so I don't get left behind)
I kept on (so I don't get forgotten with time)
I kept on (so I could just bless your mind)
I kept on (for the people bustin my rhymes)

Hook (x2)

[Apl.de.ap]
Getting bout it in my room
Back in '89
Freestylin in the cipher exercisin the mind
Just coolin with my grim Brand Nubian rhymes
B-boyin & breakin, Tribe behind the nation
Diggin in the place with DJ Motivation
Live and direct on your radio station
Rockin with the band, doin shows for fans, mic in my hand
Standing in my b-boy stance
Whoever thought that the Peas would spread like a disease
And infect the whole globe with hip hop & soul
This is for the people that love the Peas' sound
We still makin music, we holdin it down
This is dedicated to the Cold Crush
If it wasn't for y'all, there wouldn't be us
This is dedicated to UTFO
Grandmaster Flash & Kurtis Blow

[Intro: Macklemore]
And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
We're city kids
You get what you ask for

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

[Hook: Choir]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer
At least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days
I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on
Close the chapter
Live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes
But those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality
Rarely lit
Memories, a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors
Graffiti and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain
Some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again
I guess it's relative
The Camel Lights
The whiskey, ryes
Sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second wind
Grow a moustache
Pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

[Hook: Choir]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
So here's to the nights
Dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Poor out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real
Even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while
Just to say I visit

[Bridge: Macklemore]
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

[Hook: Choir]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
You got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain, you probably think that
This song is about you, don't you?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Now don't you dare act like you don't know (don't know)
Know what's up (Know what's up) cause your nose is up
I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior(Dior)
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Cause it sure seems you got no doubts
But we all see you got your head in the clouds

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go

[Verse 2]
All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on

[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Verse 3]
We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go

[Verse 4]
Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause baby, we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on

[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Bridge]
I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?"

[Chorus 2]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like a song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone?
Never let me go

[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

'Cause it's just another day and I like gettin' my salad tossed

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far (Ross!)

She's so sididdy, they can't afford her,  but -
All the boys stare, when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway, head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights, beam bright, got the best boobs
I call her double R (Range Rover), my rough rider
We hit a couple malls, then the Ramada
Cause on the road of life, she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter, than a coke bottle
She super charge cars, anything for Minaj
And she could only park, in the superstar garage
Cause she-she-she-she bad, if anybody ask
Her bags is boss, cause her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer, tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch, named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her, she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton

She's so dope, you know she even help me -
Transport the dope, that mama stay around that -
White, like the pope, they get the canine, but they -
Can't smell the coke, now you tell me why is it
Now you tell me why is it, don't need the Riker's visit
That is because, I'm about the color, of the Geico lizard
She L-Lewinsky, hold ya bosses-es
Come around town, three hundred horses-es
Power she devour, got them gettin' divorces-es
(Sirens blaring)....I don't stop for officers
And now we hit hydraulics, that's for the left turn
Need I repeat, she got more horses, than a Western
You know she beat weight, so she don't eat late
A vegetarian, she sipping on that V-eight
They try to gas her, they try to put it in her
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner
Her lip gloss poppin', we call it Armor All
We chuck the deuces up, d-d-don't know all of y'all

[Intro: Macklemore]
1, 2, now

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Those three-plus years, I was so proud of
Then I threw them all away for two Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that "He lied to me"
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fucking privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
A "08/10/08" that now has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box as a saint
That I never was, just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
What the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know, what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look at him directly into his face
Deceit on your shoulders, deceivingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built has been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth and be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up, given props, loved and praised
I guess, I gotta get this on the page
Feeling sick and helpless
Lost the compass where self is
I know what I've gotta do, and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em, yeah
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them

[Hook: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you’d gone, but you were with me all along, along

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober, I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the East Side, shaking, tweaking
Hope that they don't see it, hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed, shooken
If they call on me I'm passin', if they talk to me I'm booking
Out that door, but before, I can make it
Somebody stops me and says "Are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time, I just wanted to say that
If it wasn't for 'Otherside,' I wouldn't have made it"
I just looked down at the ground and say, "Thank you"
She tells me she has nine months, and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry, fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I want to tell her I relapsed, but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her, "Congrats"
Get back to my car, and I think I'm tripping, yeah
Cause God wrote "Otherside," that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man, I fucked up
Like so many others, I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good

[Bridge: Macklemore]
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

[Hook: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you’d gone, but you were with me all along, along

[Outro: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost

[Spoken Intro]
Eyo BattleCat, It's yo Dogg
Bigg Snoopy D.O. Double G
Eyka
I was thinking...
We need to take it back to the way it used to be
You feel me?
Yeah, c'mon, yeah drift with me, drift with me, c'mon, drift with me y'all

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Take it back to the afros and the naturals
Cape cutter picks we slips into the back roads
I'm O.G. my nigga for real though
Straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
I'm looking at the overview
Thinking bout '86 damn I was overdue
Walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
While I'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
That I came from it raised me real Crip crazy
What up, oops a daisy
Demon or a heathen, scheming while I'm dreaming
Screaming to get even, seeing is believing
And don't you forget that
Get it to you get back hit that kick back
Three flies one a way
Reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quit trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

[Verse 2]
I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight
Make it back to my ride
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
Slid me away just to get me away
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood
I'm banging riding but doing it good
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred
With the dealers the killers the realest
The best from the west and the beast from the east
Yeah I'm acting a fool
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school
I chose this life cause I knows this life
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight
I'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
I can still hear my grandma's voice
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
Reminisce
It's all right

[Verse 3]
If you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
And these was the rules squeeze on these fools
I came up in a different era homie
Where the G's is the G's and the little wannabe's really want it
Wanna be like cause the C life make you wanna G like
Now who you wanna be like Snoop
That fool on the TV screen
Or the homie on the corner getting major cream
In the Cadillac beating like Battlecat
A nigga with money don't know how to act
Smoke til your eyes get cataracts
All money nonsense yeah none of that
Quarter sack run it back
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back
Lil bitch was a bunny rat
Watch for the funny hat
Cause it's gonna come
And my granny said it's no fun
She say day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right

[Hook]
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right

[Intro: Macklemore]
Uh-huh, um

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
1-2, now
'Round here they sing broken hymns
Their prayers flow better when they're soaked in gin
The amp's dusty and sits in the corner
By a bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Rusted faces, familiar places
Even if they haven’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems drown themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it, a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

[Hook: Allen Stone]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the church is
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, all the Lord Have Mercys
Blessed in holy water, the sin, oh Holy Father
Have you ever smelled flesh that sweats out Monarch vodka?
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Calling to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens and I can re-up on that doctrine
The people close to me say that I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This is the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got sins that scald like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, far more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

[Bridge: Macklemore]
Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the Neon Cathedral
Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God, Neon Cathedral
Neon Cathedral

[Hook: Allen Stone]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Outro: Allen Stone]
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
If I just went in and stole it, the police would have noticed
Gotta be strategic, creep it, go in, leave without motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, casing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions (millions)
Headed in sweating, open that front door
"Interscope" printed out right by the entrance
Door closes, not a metaphor
Then I start towards that front desk, right where you check in
Dressed in a uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, rush in
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador ("Fuck you!")
Carrying two cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor I'm late, paintin' Jimmy Iovine's office
Holding my breath 'bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud that you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then I'm leaving town with that contract
And I'm spazzing out, grabbing the A&R out
His chair and I'm taking him hostage
I don't give a fuck, step into the elevator, press "3"
Now I'm headed up ("Heist!")
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And I’m ready and willing to bust 'em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers "Go ahead", and then gives me a wink

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I made it past security, the secretary, the cubicles
But it’s weird, it’s like this room I’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
CDs boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin' that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yeah, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven-sent
Big, block, silver letters, read it out loud, "President" ("Heist!")
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck, he said

[Outro: Jimmy Iovine & Macklemore]
"We’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music, it's so impressive, and this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you're destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous
Now I’m sorry, I’ve had a long day, remind me now what your name is?
That’s right, 'Macklemore,' of course... today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? We’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out, we’ll need back that money that you borrowed"
"So it’s really like a loan?"
"A loan?! Come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
You'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets twenty, booking agent gets ten
So shit, after taxes, you and Ryan have 7% to split!
That’s not bad, I’ve seen a lot worse
No one will give you a better offer than us"
"Mm-hm," I replied, "I appreciate the offer"
Thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist
Than succeed at getting fucked

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon, yay
And these days, days days, they never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melted
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the pharaohs
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band-aid when you’re gone
Now I, now I-I-I, I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
Today we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Alright now, we open up
That car door, hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by stickin' out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight, we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun like

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
"Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t have"
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Loungin' on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sippin' on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sippin' Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it...

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Eighty4 Fly]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (Man throw that up)
That's what it is (That's what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (Biatch!)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can't see me through my tints (Nuh-uh)
I'm riding real slow (Slow motion)
In my paint, wet, drippin', shinin' like my 24s (Umbrella)
I ain't got 24s (Nuh-uh)
But I'm on those Vogues (Yeah)
That's those big white walls, r-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rollin' in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I'm loungin'
In some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
Lookin' down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashin'
I'm duckin', buckin' them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge
The same one we'd walk across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school
Candy paint, two-seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And rolled on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in, as I was leavin' I started screamin'

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Yeah, uh
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Chorus: Hollis]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright

[Verse 1]
Down the street you can hear her scream "You're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

[Verse 2]
A little Indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle
But something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually

[Verse 3]
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
'Cause she was crippled for life and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

[Outro]
And so castles made of sand
Slips into the sea eventually

[Intro: Usher]
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Y'all niggas will never learn
Yeah, Usher, baby
You can't really fuck with me
This club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front, I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gon' finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Verse 1: Usher]
I know you wanna leave with me
You wanna be seen with me
I can't lie, girl, you fine as hell
And I might let you be with me
I know you wanna come with me
Come take a ride with me
Can't be shy, girl
'Least not tonight, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front, I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gon' finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Break: Ludacris]
I say hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll

[Verse 2: Usher]
Is that your girl looking at me?
Be clear where y'all wanna be
Me on you, her on me
If you feeling free, we can do it three (just playing)
Put all the clothes up
Girl, go make your mind up
Get you back to the crib with your feet up
Make love till it's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front, I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gon' finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Well, it's big Bun B, the man back in my Bia
Never been an everyday Joe like G.I
Sitting on a stack of greenbacks, 'bout knee high
From the underground, I'm a king like T.I
Son, Bun low-pro like a B.I
Brought back and tell that like I see ya
Bread on the regular, swag, you see mine
Pretty boy Usher, you know that we fly
Fresher than a mall, richer than than a bank
Big body Benz sitting bigger than a tank
Fall up in the club, we gonna buy up all the drinks
And holler at your girl, give a damn what you think
Fuck how you feel, I'ma keep it real
I'ma let your baby girl know what's the deal
Pretty don't pimp, little mama, keep it trill
Drink get low, think you need a refill
Know you with your man and you still go down
Might be a fool, but he ain't gon' clown
He know a real G when he see one
He better get like me and try to be one
You know what it do, let it be done
Get it now before you see it on the re-run
Take it to the spot, get your ass hot
And you can run back and tell your girls what we done
Tell you what? I'ma give you one shot
Give you one chance, girl, show me what you got
Drop it down low, to the floor, let it pop
Twerk that thing, work it, don't stop
Tell your man that his ass out of luck
I'm finna put your bad ass in the trunk
Take you back to the crib and cut
That's what's up (that's what's up)

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front, I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gon' finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Outro: Usher]
I say hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll
Hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll
Shawty, Yeahx3

Hello, I was thinking bout you
What you're doing, ain't it raining out there
Yeah cause I'm on the other side of town and I was
Thinking bout taking a ride on down to come and see you
Girl I know it's been two weeks
And I got you feeling like you've been knew me
Ohhhh that's what the truth do
Don't try to put up them walls I see through you
And I can see that you been hurt before
But girl that wasn't me, so we can take it slow
Gotta get you 'fore my times up
Talk to me baby

Chorus:
Come and get your mind f*cked alright, alright
I'll make you feel like you want something good
Got what you want, what you need
Don't make me beg baby please, come and get your mind f*cked
All night, girl I wish them other niggas would
Tryin to be like me, take a chance and you'll see
Baby you gonna get your mind f*cked
I'm just f*cking with you
Hope for sure you know
I wanna do something with you
First I get up in that brain and remain the same
After we play this freaky game say my name t-pain t-pain

Yeah yeah I'm bout to put your fucking knees in the air
But if I do it now, how would feel about me
Would you kick me out, or give me that body
Cause I can see that you've been hurt before
Girl that wasn't me so we can take it slow
I'm 'gon get you 'fore my time's up
Fuck with me baby

2 x chorus:
Come and get your mind f*cked alright, alright
I'll make you feel like you want something good
Got what you want, what you need
Don't make me beg baby please, come and get your mind f*cked
All night, girl I wish them other niggas would
Tryin to be like me, take a chance and you'll see
Baby you gonna get your mind f*cked

[Intro]
Ladies & Gentlemen these are my hang ups
Let me explain

[Verse 1]
It’s kinda hard not to be a dick
But y’all these pussies round here they looking for the shit
And by God they found ‘em burried under the ground
Thinking ’bout what he has done thinking
If he keep doing it one day the money will come
One of his sons can get it done if he wanna become
That son of a gun that leave ‘em home when he wanna get drunk
Then he come back and slum back on that hole that he bring
And you can use shit but drop your head in fucking disgust
This underdog shit has to stop
‘Cause if they had an ounce of respect a half a cup
You fucking admit that every song that I smashed you then dropped
And you’re carrer would’ve been done bitch like it or not
I came to take my crown back it’s about time
So you about facing I’ll be about mine
Every nigga that shined on me has been outshined
I’m ripping new assholes and snatching out spines

[Verse 2]
It’s kinda hard not to be a bitch when everybody tryin’ to fuck you
Then use you when they need you then do their best to duck you
But since nobody called or answer emails
Tell ‘em to kiss my ass and spare me the fucking details
‘Cause ain’t no such thing as the best next thing
Unless you talking about how this is better than 3 rings
And niggas catching on like damn he ain’t wrong
These niggas is getting Grammy’s from makin T pain songs
Yeahhhh, and you can blame it on that
And if you got something to say then you can lay it on wax
‘Cause I ain’t disrespecting I’m just pissed off a lil bit
I put in all the work and you gettin’ all the attention
And when they do their speeches T-Pain they never mention
That’s how niggas automatically get on my shit list
So in conclusion I’m actually a nice dude
And to my real fans excuse my shitty attitude

[Verse 3]
It’s kinda hard to please everybody
And keep yourself happy and your kids asking
We ain’t got no money left daddy?
And you say yeah, but it fell into the wrong hands
That’s some hard shit to say when you a grown man
But I’ma get it motherfuck excuses
Plus these niggas thought they finally got T-Pain to chuck the deuces
Here they walk into my studio and play their fucking music
I play what I been doin’ they tell me it’s fucking stupid
Then they leave and tell their security I’m fucking losing
And all them young fire beats was too fucking confusing
They can’t keep up with me I’m classified as a nuisance
And next time that I see them they say they got new and newer shit
But they sound just like the shit I showed them the first time
With way less music and way worse rhyme
So this my farewall I’m sorry for the fallout
I’m cutting my phone off I bet you niggas call now

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Outro]
Fifty thousand dollars all in the air and shit
Brick Squad, dope boi, and the money man
GUCCI!

[Verse 1]
I'm a so Icey veteran so you can't say beginners luck
All my boys tote choppaz so your best bet robbin' armored trucks
Georgia boys don't give a fuck, we'll jack you then we'll tie you up
50-50 chance that we'll trick you if you shop with us
Boulder crest so dirty dirty, zone six boys tote thirty thirties
Glock 9 under Falcon jerseys make you need some plastic surgery
Bandana under my eye, hat so low can't see my face
And if you got them cake to bake then Gucc might do a home invasion
Hi my name is Gucci Gucci meet my homeboy Mackie Slug
Sawed-off AR pulled out shorty you know I got extra slugs
Black T still on when I mob, black lugz still on when I walk
Black pistol 23 my nigga he'll think thats my second job

[Hook]
I walk around the city like, it don't matter
The earth my turf nobody tries me cause they know better
So save the chit chatta I'm too deep you boys shallow
I run 4 deep me and myself and I and plus my shadow
Shadow, my shadow, hold me down for whateva
Even if I tried my best I couldn't run from my shadow
So no matter, how wealthy that I get he's not jealous
So when I have no one to talk to, I talk to my shadow!

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm thorough, under my polo, I'm out on promo
Got these tear drops, under my izzeye, don't make it one more
And I had kilos, one for like 2-0, that was 0-4
I had drizzo, you bad da smizzo, but keep it low though
Don't tell the po-po, I'm friend with fizzo, cause thats a no-no
Smokin' guido, me and my vatos, but you's a bozo
I'm passin' low yo, down to La Plizzo, this shit like Wayco
I got candy paint on my '74, your shit from Maaco
And off the tizzop, connect the dizzots, I'm building legos
Ran the tizan just like them waffles, I call them eggos
I got hundreds, all in my pocket, a stupid bank roll
If ya try me, coroner gon' wrap you, up like an egg roll

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bricks, all white bricks
Corner-boy I probably sold more rocks than a rock pit
Tryin' to fill my shoes is like an armless man with chops sticks
Got a dark brown soft top bentley chocolate
I'm so mach 6, homeboy you so not shit
Playin' free can't come touch me cause you're not it
I'm on fire steaming hot, I can boil grits
Jet-Li with the shoes, Gucci rockin' new kicks
ATLiens baby girl let's have a moon day
Got 8 bedrooms I'm dying for a roommate
I was home schooled, I didn't have a schoolmate
Psych! I went to trap school 60K in 12th grade
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
I'm a millionaire but self-made wealth craze
Like a junkie cravin' bricks so I'm in kitchens all day
SKRRRR!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

[Outro]
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing

[Tyler]
In the back of a truck with a gay slut
Tryna bust a nut in her butt with no makeup
Passed out, this dead bitch don't wanna wake up
Fuck Rachael Ray, cause she tryna get a cake-up
Eatin' donuts (white hoes)
Gettin' high as fuck (snort coke)
Whoa, I'm just tryna finger it in your hot car
Fuck a nigga, just fuck here in top block
I'm a unicorn (yeah), you aren't a unicorn (yeah)
Now I'm a uniform (yeah), rapin' you to perform (what?)
Made me doper than my shrooms in my system
My trophy sister, she'll get mugged
Right in the back of a club with a
45 shotty, bet you 30 dollars you won't
Find her body, now she's fucked
Get these bitches love drunk

[Hook]
What up what up, what's goin' on?
This OF, up on the song
Why you staring over here like something's wrong?
We the West over here, nigga sing along
What up what up, what's goin' on?
This OF, up on the song
(Bitch)

[Mike G]
Uh, in the back of a blue truck, fucked up
Rollin' dice, snake eyes, niggas ain't got luck
I just lay back, still ain't blew up
Honey got me some of that rum like I threw up
You should really fear me
Made this bitch squint and couldn't see me clearly
Bitch I'm a gift like you lookin' at Christmas
You should look up to him, now you on my shit list
Bitch I ain't fucked with you before
You ain't gotta hound me when I step through the door
I'm the best doin' it
He's spittin' that super shit
Why the nigga so lame
I don't even say his name
But he white like cocaine
This is fire, propane

[Hook]

[Tyler]
Wait a minute, what's your name?
Let's play a game of balls in your throat
Smell like fish, cheesy like a goat, bitch
The only that she good for is sucking dick

[Mike G]
And I came quick
I fucked a bitch in a plaid skirt
I mean raped, don't ask her
Then I put the quick punch on her lip
Bade her in the basement

[Tyler]
I was wearing a really nice dress
With sweet puffs, green and white
This is nice, I look nice
Fix my dick...
Check it twice
Old Twinkling Lee
Can't see the right roads when the streets are paved
The old slave mill, might grind slow
But it grinds fine... yeah

[Verse 1]
African Herbsman, why linger on?
Just concentrate cuz heaven lives on
Retired slaveman, will look with a scorn
With a transplanted heart

[Bridge - Bob Marley and the Wailers]

[The Wailers]
Yes how quick we have to part
Yes how quick we have to part

[Bob]
The remembrance... of today... is the sad feeling of tomorrow...

[The Wailers]
Yes how quick we have to part

[Bob]
Oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
African Herbsman, seize your time
I'm taking illusion on the edge of my mind
I'm taking losers down through my life
Down through my life, yeah

[Bridge - Bob Marley and the Wailers]

[The Wailers]
Yes how quick we have to part
Yes how quick we have to part

[Bob]
Did they part? Yes they part!
In remembrance of today...

[The Wailers]
Yes how quick we have to part

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Bridge - Bob Marley and the Wailers]

[The Wailers]
Yes how quick we have to part
Yes how quick we have to part

[Bob]
In remembrance, of today, brings sad feelings of tomorrow

[The Wailers]
Yes how quick we have to part

[Bob]
Believe me oh, oh lord I praise

African Herbsman
African Herbsman
African, African Herbsman

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 1]
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man (awww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a pink palm pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Neighbors keep tripping, I'm like, "I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!"

[Bridge]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 2]
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massage my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hookah, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Interlude]
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin' eh

[Bridge 2]
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Someone kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Grab your bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
And M.J. was King, and Prince was Prince
And Raven has ruled ever since

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Chorus]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 1]
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

[Verse 2]
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

[Chorus]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

[Chorus]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Skit: DeRay Davis]
This was founded years ago
By broke slaves, years ago
Who did not have, years ago
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago
Who did not have when we could not eat
Hmm, remember that?
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?
Do you remember all those Christmases when your mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?
Remember that?

[Skit]
I brought you brothers here today to start our own fraternity
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)
No, we have no money
We are sharin' jeans
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on
How many cars do we own? (None!)
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat with the car?
(Yes, we will!)
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!
(We can't afford no gas!)
Say it!
(We can't afford no gas!)
So we ain't drivin'!

[All whispering]
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)

[Louder]
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi-

[Leader]
I've called this private meeting today because there is a imposter among us
There is an imposter among us
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!

[Kanye (stammering)]
I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was in here-

[Leader]
No, you speak up, brother!

[Kanye]
I was gon' stick-I'm tryin' to stick to my roots and-

[Leader]
What?

[Kanye]
I wanna stick to my roots, and-

[Leader]
What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye. Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like that, alright? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke

What's next?

[Intro]
Aight y'all I take back lets just say "We The Best!"
Meaning me, me, me, I, me, me AND me the best!

[Verse 1]
My ego on zero
It's just that my re-al's on hero
My confidence on Michael but my pride is on Tito
I ain't paid dues? What is this receipt 4?
Boy said, "With Lasers you kinda stumbled some and you're only as good as your last record."
I said, "So I guess I'm only as good as being number 1!"
I asked him "What's your success measurer? The message or the register?
In the end you got a win-win, only thing I lost is my competitors."
He said, "Yeah but Lasers was your worst and nothing like ya first."
I said, "Well that's me vs. me and your growth is nothing like your birth."
He said, "You're a lame dumbed down sellout only known for talking out your ass."
I humbly nodded in agreement and asked 4 more ketchup in my bag
I left thinking how I used to be in his shoes
Writing verses flipping burgers
Now I serve the world pearls from socio-political menus
And how I could never back, only because I never left
So if you find a few diamonds in your sandwich then you know who was the chef
A Rolex in your fries, a chain in your salad
A range rover in your soup and a extra slice palace
People, Friend of L-U-P-End cuz!
G'night

[Verse 1]
Every year we do better, steady on the rise
The tears for lost ones weigh heavy on the eyes
Dita sunny's, gold prezzy, twin turbo chevy fo' a ride of course
From the backseats of phantoms I thought of leaving thrOUGH suicide doors
Love got me through it, best fans ever made the whole world care
Had 51st & 6th looking like Tahrir Square!
Apologize for dumbing it, but look what has become of it
"All Black Everything," some old white southern woman humming it
Took Gaza Strip's politics and put them number one and shit
Took the myth that concious don't equal commercial and mothafuckin' pummelled it!
Weapons for the weak, lessons for the meek
The too proud to beg, and the too poor to speak
The too smart to listen, and the too dumb to teach
Two sides to every story so I listen to both speak
Shout to all the DJ's, who gave a nigga replays
@fakeshoredrive, @rapradar & the whole internet space
You put it online I put it in they face
And there it will remain, for a tleast another week
Right at number 1, hahaha yeah nigguh
Stay strong Japan, Nate Dogg REST IN PEACE!!!

[Verse 1]
6 years ago there was a seismic shift
A rise, a lift
He finally arrived in rap form
And used that form as his platform to provide his gift
Summarized as sick, quick witted and hip
Also promoted wisdom in a broken system gave the fans a fix
And bitch niggas the fits, a culmination of hard work
Long nights through cold water and large surf
Wading the water this MC became a Man, McMan, Star Search...
Now in between these here albums we've had our ups & downs
Partly my fault 'cause the way I talk a mix of giving a fuck & he don't fuck around
But I always kept it honest as my father made me promise
Before he left this world to go and dwell amongst the comets
So put aside the comments, the constant blog blah blah & me arguing with comics
Cause #Sept25th I bring again the gift prepare to be astonished
And waste no time when trying to decipher every verse
Cause if part 1 is just the gift, part 2 will be the curse
#FL2

[Verse 1]
Watch out for the divide and conquer
There lies the monster behind the suit & tied lies
Who love that super-sized mantra
Bigger, better even if you don't need it
And you gone pay every which way for the privilege to poison yoself
And that's on every hole Jesus had to bleed with
Peace be upon him
You see you can't have a healthy tree if the seed sick
Though yo forest will be enormous, that illness will never leave it
"God ain't American!" so says Jessica CareMoore
Therefore there's more there for me to prepare for
And I can't get to heaven just by joining the airforce
I reflect on everything Baldwin ever taught me
When I had to fall back on Zinn when Noam Chomsky lost me
When Cornell stood up for me when everybody fought me
And find comfort in rebellion even though I know what it'll cost me
Let's be clear, I fear no man on this here planet
My younger hunger back and the only thing I fear is ham on this here sandwich
#FL2Sept25

[Verse 1]
Harsh, not for cuddlers, but for butcher knife jugglers
Jumpin' out of jets over jungles in search of jaguar jugulars
A paper bag is child's play, someone is mistaken
I practice rapping myself out of bear traps, a straight jackets like a vacation
But let's say it's a paper bag, and I'm hog tied and gagged
Handcuffed to safe then locked inside the trunk of a cab
Then the cab is driven to the river, set on fire
You know what skip the river lets say quick sand cause quicksand's thicker
Makes it harder to move, especially when the dynamite is being triggered
Oh that I forgot mention, we added a little TNT for a lil' extra tension
Then comes the explosion
A shower of pieces of cab, safe, sand, handcuffs and paperbag
The crowd stands silent, maybe a few gasp
Just when all hope is lost, and the crowd gets really sad
The smoke clears I appear with cucumber slices on my eyes enjoying my mudbath
Saying, "This all you niggas got for me?! Next time tie me up properly
Lu-Dini is unimpressed by this shoddily botched locksmith mockery!"
If I'm trapped in a paper bag just make sure it's a pen in it
Cause that bitch gone look like the roof of da Sistine Chapel when I'm finished
Paper Bags?! I'm the guy they use to rap the mouth holes in paper masks
A major task's for any one not trained in the art of hatin' trash
That's why I practice so fiendish
To make sure every little flicker of garbageness of my inner rap self is aggressively extinguished
It's what defines meanness, in a mean defined linguist
That leaves behind lines thick as linguini
Every time I string a stream of mean shit
Now that's a mean twist
Like a towel getting wringed by a man with a machine wrist
I'll give you back Hoffa but you gotta hand over the Teamstas!!!
So ends today's bars...enjoy your day...
#FL2

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Listen, babe, I think it's time for me to come clean
I mean I haven't been the most faithful
And I don't know how else to say this plain and simple
I been cheatin', believe me
This isn't easy especially since you've been so good to me

The hardest thing I've ever done is tellin' you
You're not the only one, just understand this
You made a man outta ignorance
And like a boy I toyed with innocence
This double lives not worth livin'
Not givin' more to her and I apologize

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
But we both swim too well, to submerge ourselves

And I'm tired of the shame
Of bein' the fool, too cool to maintain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me, darling, the blame's all mine

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
When I come home to you with open arms
Insist on pressin' on my overcoat
The alcohol and still cigarette smoke
I know you've been skeptical, I play it off like you're delusional
The fact is that I'm losin' you

And I'm scared, she doesn't want me
The way I need her to know, she doesn't want me
The way I need her to
I'm pleading with the judge on my knees
God, please just make these charges go away

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
But we both swim too well, to submerge ourselves

And I'm tired of the shame
Of bein' the fool, too cool to maintain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me, darling, the blame's all mine

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Girl, I promise I'll do my best to impress the jury
Cause when the smoke settles and one of us falls to the dirt
It was worth all of the hurt and if not let's cut our losses
Cause you crossed the line, thinkin' I'd choose you over music
That's just stupid, this whole situations bogus
Especially since I'm so focused
From the beginning to the end
And we in with these friends
Unfortunately this is hopeless

Did my best to juggle both of you
Struggled but I'm still here holdin' you
Tie the man up, stand up, put your hands up
If you understand what I'm goin' through

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
But we both swim too well, to submerge ourselves

And I'm tired of the shame
Of bein' the fool, too cool to maintain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me, darling, the blame's all mine

Little did they know that they was in for a motherfucking big surprise
Left home locked in my zef zone
Ready for the test yo? What the fuck, I guess so

Get everything for free like Dr. Dre Beats headphones

Make my mummy happy 'cause I get so paid
Making my money rapping over techno rave
I can take you 'round the world, let's go babe
When I step up and do my thing I put you in a trance
My zef motherfucking clique got it going on

I fink you freaky and I like you a lot

[Verse 1]
I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
"What is he doing? What on earth's the plan, has he got one?"
You better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun
I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true, said, I'm not like you
And I don't want your advice or your praise
Or to move in the ways you do and I never will

[Chorus]
'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

[Verse 2]
I've seen your eyes as they fix on me, full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending!
Trying to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we get in near recoups what we're spending
He said, "I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay ya? How much did they pay ya?
You'd have been better to stay round our way"
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

[Chorus]
'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail
'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

[Instrumental break]

[Shouted]
All you people are vampires!

[Verse 1]
Walking on the beat, with my backpack on and my snapback on, with the rap back on, uhuh
Beautiful girls wearing high heels, asking how I feel, I feel I, uhuh
That’s when you walk by, like damn you fly and I was like uhuh
You ask me where I'm from and I say Canada, uhuh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Uhuh, uhuh, yeah

Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl

[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now

[Post-Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
I know
I know
I know
I, I, I, I
I think of letting go, go, go

[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Money owed, dope sold bitch you already know
White birds black birds serving pigeons and crows
I whip the dope so good, a benz jumped out the bowl
Motherfuck the ATF and the border patrol
Me and my amigos at the table shots of Don Julio
I fucked your bitch a week ago, but I ain't gonna fuck her no more (Psych!)
I got the stacks under the mattress so I sleep with the dough
I got them bricks stuffed in the wall so yea I live with the coke
It's Bricksquad and I know you niggas mad cause you broke
He seen my video on the TV and he broke the remote
I'm like Pablo in his prime, shoulder deep with the snow
I read yo paper work nigga man yall niggas some hoes

[Chorus: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got all eyes on me like Pac did
But I ain't trying to go broke like Joc did
I ain't trying to fuck my dealer did like Block did
I'm trying to stack them free bands like Rock did
Tell the truth I never thought that I get this big
I think I'm about to buy some choppers like Tip did
I came in, flexing jewelry like Flip did
Got every penny out the 6 I swear I milked it
That Bricksquad shit I built it
I put Flocka in the game and he killed it
I did a song with Lil Wayne and I killed it
My only wish my nigga Dunk was here to rip shit (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit

[Verse 3: Future]
My uncle Ronnie died from smoking cane
My cousin suicidal, he blowed out his brain
They gave my nigga 30 years, he in a chain gang
I just had to drop a 40 racks up on my ring
I'm in Giuseppe's walking in the rain
I can't even help it I been through some things
I put my heart in every verse and when I'm on that plane
I'm thanking God for all my watches, and all my chains
I'm in Chanel and I'm in Ferragamos
These bitches know I'm worth these commas
They know I got that llama
And my lil sister just got out that coma
That sickle cell hurtin' her bones
Free my nigga Bomma

[Chorus: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit

Our president talks with a fuckin' fork in his tongue
Beats banging in my head so I walk with a bump
In my own zone, my sweet reality
Got fuck-all to do with your bleak reality
In South Africa I'm the boss of the game
In da overseas shit's like fuckin' insane
I'm walking down the street, hot chicks calling my name
It's like I dropped a cap of acid and it's not going away
Since we dropped Zef Side two years ago
Still freak out every motherfucker who hears my flow
I know how to get da dough, know how to spend da dough
Rocking Alexander Wang from head to toe

Dropped them like a sack of bricks tied to my leg
Now I got them wings on my ankles!
Bo-baas boner blowing in da wind!
Arigato good smile! I'm glowing from within
Hip-hop's fucked! It's gone from, "Move bitch! Get out the way!"
All the way to: "When I was thirteen... I took my first drugs"
What the fuck? Jesus Christ!
Help me out, all I want is to be surprised!

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I fall in with an attitude, Billy badass with a back pack full of bad swag
That I picked out I'm a hand it out to, anyone that ever did wrong to me anything that
Did wrong to me I'm a take it back like a vac, you pay tax tonight. Bully!

[Verse 1: Mark Foster]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things, and I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Run boy
Are you ready
(Kendrick)
Do I look like danger? Do I look like a criminal's anger? Do I look like problem when I tell 'em
That I got 'em? I can even make the famous famous. Pull up, pull up bring it back up rewind
Then I pull out the cups then we pull out the wine
I'm a rebel you a rebel then I'm bout to rock
Climb, I'm a ticking time bomb in California, land mine!
Explode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me
Everybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat

[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Hook] (x4)

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1]
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 2]
We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, "No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?"
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, "How is work, baby?"
Well, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe, I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, "'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends"
On the phone, hollin' that "Niggas is whatever"
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, "Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress"
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, "Just drive so far"
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh

[Hook]
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Ah, ash to ashes, dust to dust
Ah, skin to bone and steel to rust

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to grey
I'll be marching far away
Right to left and left to right

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Ah, ash to ashes, dust to dust
Ah, skin to bone and steel to rust

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Let tomorrow have its way
With the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day

[Chorus]
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day

[Spoken Ad Lib]
Sigmund Freud
Analyze this
Analyze this
Analyze this, this, this, this, this

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now

[Ad-Lib]
Uh! Uh!

[Chorus]
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
For every sin, I'll have to pay
A time to work, a time to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna avoid the cliché
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now

[Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go

[Ad-Lib]
Uh! Uh!

[Laughter]
I need to lay down

[Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day

[Outro]
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day

[Verse 1]
They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants

[Chorus]
And the riot squad, they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

[Verse 2]
Cinderella, she seems so easy
"It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
"You Belong to Me, I Believe"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave"

[Chorus]
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

[Verse 3]
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain

[Chorus]
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

[Verse 4]
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness

[Chorus]
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

[Verse 5]
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet

[Chorus]
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

[Verse 6]
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
"Have mercy on his soul"

[Chorus]
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

[Verse 7]
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

[Chorus]
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
"Get outta here if you don't know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row"

[Verse 8]
At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene

[Chorus]
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

[Verse 9]
Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
"Which side are you on?"
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers

[Chorus]
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 10]
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name

[Chorus]
Right now, I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row

[Harmonica Outro]

[Verse 1]
Seven o'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
She says, "Is this Behind the Music with Lynyrd Skynyrd?"
And I say, "I don't know
Say, "It's gettin' late, what you wanna do for dinner?"
She says, "I kinda had a big lunch
So I'm not super hungry."
I said, "Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either
But I could eat."
She said, "So what do you have in mind?"
I said, "I don't know. What about you?"
She said, "I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat."
I said, "That's what we're gonna do!
But first you gotta tell me
What it is you're hungry for!"
And she says, "Let me think...
What's left in our refrigerator?"
I said, "Well, there's tuna, I know."
She said, "That went bad a week ago!"
I said, "Is the chili okay?"
She said, "You finished that yesterday!"
I hopped up and said
"I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?"
She's like, "Why would I want to eat liver?
I don't even like liver!"
I'm like, "No, I said 'delivered.'"
She's like, "I heard you say 'liver'!"
I'm like, "I should know what I said..."
She's like, "Whatever! I just don't want any liver!"
Well, I was gonna say something
But my cell phone started to ring
Now who could be callin' me?
Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry
Callin' for the third time today...
My wife said, "Let it go to voicemail."
I said, "Okay."
"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right!
So what d'ya want to do?"
She said, "Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?"
"Yeah," I said, "why don't you?"
And then she said "Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?"
I say, "No"
She says, "Yes"
I say, "No"
She says, "Yes"
I say, "No"
She says, "Yes...
Oh, here's your keys"
I step a little bit closer
Say, "Okay, where ya want to go?"
She says, "How about The Ivy?"
I said, "Yeah, well, I don't know...
I don't feel like gettin all dressed up
And eatin' expensive food"
She's says, "Olive Garden?"
I say, "Nah, I'm not in the mood...
And Burrito King would make me gassy
There's no doubt"
She says, "Just forget about it"
I said, "No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"
Then I get an idea
I say, "I know what we'll do!"
She says, "What?"
I say, "Guess!"
She says "What?"
I say, "We're goin' to the drive-thru!"
So we head out the front door
Open the garage door
Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition
And then I turn it sideways
Then we fasten our seat belts
As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru
Heading off to the drive-thru
We're approaching the drive-thru
Getting close to the drive-thru!
Almost there at the drive-thru
Now we're here at the drive thru
Here in line at the drive-thru
Did I mention the drive-thru?

[Verse 2]
Well, here we are
In the drive-thru line, me and her
Cars in front of us, cars in back of us
All just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo
With his brights on behind me
I lean out the window and scream
"Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?"
My wife says "Maybe we should park...
We could just go eat inside."
I said, "I'm wearin' bunny slippers
So I ain't leavin' this ride..."
Now a woman on a speaker box
Is sayin', "Can I take your order, please?"
I said, "Yes indeed, you certainly can
We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese."
Then my wife says "Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind!
I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time"
I said, "You always get a cheeseburger!"
She says, "That's not what I'm hungry for."
I put my head in my hands and scream
"I don't know who you are anymore!"
The voice on the speaker says
"I don't have all day!"
I said, "Then take our order
And we'll be on our way!
I wanna get a chicken sandwich
And I want a cheeseburger, too"
She's like, "You want onions on that?"
I'm like, "Yeah, I already said that I do...
Plus we need curly fries
And don't you dare forget it!
And two medium root beers
No, just one—we'll split it."
Then I said "I'm guessin' that
You're probably not too bright...
So read me back my order
Let's make sure you got it right."
She says "One—you want a chicken sandwich
Two—you want a cheeseburger
Three—curly fries, and a large root beer"
"Stop! Don't go no further!"
"I never ordered a large root beer
I said medium, not large!"
Then she says "We're havin' a special
I supersized you at no charge."
"Oh." And that's all
I could say, was "Oh."
And she says "Now there is somethin' else
That I really think you should know
You can have unlimited refills
For just a quarter more..."
I say "Great, except we're in the drive-thru...
So what would I want that for?"
Then she says "Wait a minute
Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like "No, that ain't Paul
Now tell me, who's this Paul?"
She says "Oh, he's just some guy
Who goes to school with me
I sat behind him last year
And I copied off of him in Geometry"
I said, "I know a guy named Paul
He used to be my plumber
He was prematurely bald
And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer
He also had bladder problems
And a really bad infection on his toe."
And she says, "Mister, please, you can stop right there
That's way more than I needed to know!"
And then we both were quiet
And things got real intense
Then she says "Next window, please
That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!"
So we inched ahead in line
Movin' painfully slow
I got a little bored
So I turned on the radio...

[Black Dog by Led Zeppelin]
Click, turned it off
Because my wife was getting a headache
So we both just sat there quietly for her sake
Then I looked at her
And she looked back at me
And I said "Um
I think you have somethin' in your teeth."
She turned away from me
And then turned back and said "Did I get it?"
I said "Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it...
But hey, ya know, don't sweat it."
Then she said "How about now?"
I said "Yeah, almost
There's still a little bit there, but don't worry
It's probably just a piece of toast."
Now we're at the pay window
Or whatever you call it
Put my hand in my pocket
I can't believe there's no wallet!

[Verse 3]
And the lady at the window's like
"Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two"
I turn around to my wife and say
"How much have you got on you?"
She just rolls her eyes and says
"I'll pay for this, I guess"
So she reaches into her purse
And busts out the American Express
I hand it to the lady
And she says "Oh, dear
It's gotta be cash only
We don't take credit cards here"
I took back the card and said
"Gee, really? Well, that sucks"
And that's when I found out
My wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, "I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today"
She says, "I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?"
And I said, "Never mind
Just help me to find some change..."
Now the lady at the window
Is lookin' at me kind of strange...
And she says, "Mister, please
We gotta move this line along"
I said, "Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady!
We won't be long"
So I looked around inside the glove-box
And checked the mat beneath my feet
I found a nickel in an ashtray
And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats
Before long I had a little pile
Of coins of every sort
The lady counts it up and says
"You're still about a dollar short"
And now my woman's got this weird look
Frozen on her face
She screams, "You know
I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!"
And so I turned around
To the cashier again
I shrugged and said, "Okay
Forget the chicken sandwich then"
So I pick up my change
Pick up my receipt
And I drive to the pickup window
Man, I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne-ridden
Kid about sixteen
Wearin' a dorky nametag that says
"Hello, my name is Eugene"
And he hands me a paper bag
I look him in the eyes
And I say to him, "Hey, Eugene
Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"
Well, he looks at me
And I look at him
And he looks at me
And I look at him
And he looks at me
And I look at him
And he says, "I'm sorry!
What did you want again?"
I say "Ketchup!"
And he says, "Oh, yeah, that's right...
I just spaced out there for a second
I'm really kind of burnt tonight."
And then he hands me the ketchup
And now we're finally drivin' away
And the food is drivin' me mad
With its intoxicating bouquet
I'm starvin' to death
By the time we pull up at the traffic light
I say "Baby, gimme that burger
I just gotta have a bite!"
So she reaches in the bag
And pulls out the burger
And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger
And then I unwrap the paper
I bite into those buns
And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!
Let's go
It is what it is, man
What it was, what is wasn't
Only Nigga

Uh
Blow it by the O
Blow a lot of paper
I got rich when was young
Now, the folks say that I'm famous
If you smoke this, You'd get high
Won't know what your name is
All I do is keep it G
My nigga, that's my second nature
I'm in New York with the thugs
Oakland with the scrapers
London eating Nando
Smoking weed like I'm jamaican
Monday all through sunday
All this money I be making
Never been a pussy, dawg
And never did no hating
Always been the realest
On my section no debatin’
Rolling tree I got some kush in California waiting
Breakfast on a plane, breakfast on a plane
Don't got eat when I land
I have breakfast on a plane
Diamonds in my time, my nig
My necklace is the same
Live the way I live
You get respect just for your change
Come to where I live
You might get check just for your chain
This industry is a bitch
My dawg is best to use your brain
Keep a couple niggas around thass trynna do the same
And make a couple million for you try to make a name
(x2)

[Hook: Jon B - Calling On You (sample)]
Ooh, (nigga) finally got you right here
Tonight I'll ease your mind
That's why I'm calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It's hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

[Verse 1: T.I. & Rico Love]
Okay we walk off in this bitch, ballin’ in this bitch
Hoppin’ out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin’ bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do a lot of this
Ayy, Rico told me turn the lights on (Turn the lights on!)
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
I’m a big dawg, got 'em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain’t none this raw
They like, "Ay look at T.I., ballin’ in the V.I
Bunch of bad bitches with him looking like Aaliyah"
We just pull up, hop out, go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard
This club so packed

[Chorus: Rico Love & T.I.]
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk

[Verse 2: T.I. & Rico Love]
The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your ass cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks, girl
You make your way up to my section where it’s at, girl
Okay now do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket?
Broke niggas looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right ho, roll the dice ho
And you ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoes
For every day I spent behind the wall
I do it big, ride, fly, stunt, shine and ball
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles, bust it open
If you wanna get drunk (Turn the lights on!)

[Chorus: Rico Love, T.I. & Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Rico Love]
Ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch, shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
I’m killin’ these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy
I’m a good looking rapper, I ain’t tryna stunt
I'ma fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at, ho? Where you at, ho?
Can a nigga stick his key up in ya back door? (Turn the lights on!)
Tunechi

[Chorus: Rico Love & T.I.]
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk

[Verse 4: T.I. & Rico Love]
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie (Free Boosie)
Now back that thang up for me, show me that you love me
If it’s really too much for you, you can bring a couple buddies
Every day I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacaine
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat ass, pretty toes and thangs
Long hair, don't care, long as none down there
If it's manicured, I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club, throw some money in the air
(Turn the lights on!) This club so packed

[Chorus: Rico Love, T.I. & Lil Wayne]
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk (Haha)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see

[Intro]
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

[Verse 1]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 2]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 3]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? Ooh

[Verse 1]
I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo, yes, you, yayo
You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo, how now, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

[Verse 2]
I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggie, like I told you
Yayo, yeah you, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

[Bridge]
Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark night
Yayo, yes you, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got them Robin jeans saggin' and I ain't even bragging
I gave the bitch 500 fuck it, I ain’t even crabby
Now I’m getting older rocking Gucci, Louie loafers
I still remember the first day that I ain’t have to serve smokers
You brought sand to the beach, I brought toast to the social
I gave your girlfriend an autographed Gucci Mane poster
It ain't no motherfucking secret, hell yeah I got shooters
I’m the plug to the plug, I’m a goddamn booster
You ain’t no mothafuckin’ gangsta, you’s a goddamn groupie
And you getting in my way ‘cause ya homegirl choosing
On my birthday, Gucci want a brand new Uzi
On my worst day, I’m worth 10 mil no jewelry

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Killers waiting in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a dub and told him fire ya ass up
It seem like everywhere you go, somebody try yo ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots, headshots
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots, headshots
Put a dub on your head, headshots
Headshots

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Your son called you a dead beat
Step on my feet nigga, you dead meat
I'm grinding up this ground beef
I think they just wanna surround me
Self made with a brick too
Nigga shoes dirty but the stick new
In the twelfth grade with a big crew
Now I’m well paid, I can flip you
Holding on to my dick, Michael Corleone, bitch
Head shot like Fredo, fuck nigga don’t flinch
The empire back, that empire back
I got some whip out in Fulton, my brick just keep bouncing back

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Killers waiting in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a dub and told him fire ya ass up
It seem like everywhere you go, somebody try yo ass up
I got real money nigga, I can buy my own luck
Headshots, headshots
All my young niggas aiming headshots
Headshots, headshots
Put a dub on your head, headshots
Headshots

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Couple niggas got killed at my show last weekend
But how am I to blame if they were already beefing
When they first started shooting man we was just leaving
Try Bricksquad and we won't let you get off that easy
Gucci Mane the CEO, I feel like Eazy
The rap game love me but the dope game need me
Baby says she never seen a nigga so freezy
But these VVS diamonds make me feel like Meech
I had a pistol in the club the first day I met Weezy
AR in the car the first day I met Jeezy
When I first started dissing niggas it was just teasing
Glock 40 on my hip, it was just me and Mac Bre-Z

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Killers waiting in the bushes just to tie ya ass up
Gave my young nigga a dub and told him fire ya ass up

Headshots, headshots
Put a dub on your head, headshots
Headshots

[Intro:]
Yo, listen

And I-, lemme, loo-, I-, I'm getting tired of y'all niggas and-and-and y'all bitches that be getting on my goddamn nerves
I gotta tell y'all bout y'allselves
Let's go, c'mon

[Verse 1]
Y’all must not know who I am
I don't get to the spot till 2 AM
Don’t be mad, lil' mama, cuz you not in
E'r'r'body wanna roll with the crew I’m in
They wanna know why I’m posted at the bar
I tell ‘em that I’m just singing posters at the bar
But really, Y'all know why I’m posted at the bar
You bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar
I get cake cuz I always got a hustle
I pump weight and I ain’t talkin’ ’bout my muscles
At the club every day but that ho ain’t me
Cuz I be home with the scale like Do Ray Mi

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

[Verse 2]
I hate a dude that be actin’ like he get dough
But you know money short like Sisco
Actin’ like he got funds for days
Tryna act like a mac, yeah the one with dame
I hate a dude with a mad, bling-a-bling
That shit don’t make up, for no wack ding-a-ling
I hate a dude, that be pushin’ a Benz
Or he live with his mother, or he stay with his friends
Nigga please, what the fuck you done for me
Say you run your company, but can't have company
I guess the Lord just be tryna humble me
How the fuck you eatin’ tuna and it's not bumblebee

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back

[Verse 3]
I hate a girl that be stuntin’ in the game
Iced out chain with her best friend name
Cuz them the girls that be swervin’ in my lane
Why they lookin’ for change in they boyfriend Range
I hate a clown touch down to my town
But when the check come she short like bust downs
I hate a girl stay singin’ in public
Everywhere I go bitch be singin’ some dumb shit (shut the fuck up)
If I could get a deal I'd have one too
I hate a girl that see her man and say , that’s my boo (stop playing)
It make you mad when they front like they right
They need help like they only got 5 on it

[Chorus]
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
Tell ‘em to bring it back, tell ‘em to bring it back
When I step up in the spot that's a wrap
I do my 2 step one time with a snap
I do my new step, two times with a clap
On me, get a glass, on me, bring it back
(Drake)
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Drake verse 2)
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?
(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl
(Aye Aye Aye)

(Lil Wayne)
This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
How long will this last
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new

(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(aye,aye,aye)

(Lil Wayne)
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew better(um huh)and dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..
(Drake)
Is anything I'm doing brand new(6x)
Is everything I'm doing too late(6x)

Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?

(chorus w/Drake)
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah

(Lil Wayne)
And this is the remix baby weezy baby,drizzy, yung mula baby

[Drake: Verse 1]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over. Baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya!
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

(Background voice)
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
So keep thinkin' you the man
Cause it's all part of my plan
I-I-I'm ready for ya
Nothin' on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please
(Background voice)

[Drake - Verse 2]
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast
Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus I got a sex pistol
Pointed right at you "BANG!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south
Proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
Young money 'till the death, I took the carter route
Im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about

[Hook]

[End]

Artist: Drake

[Verse 1]
I don't read, yeah, I just guess
As the world turns
Don't bring me with your mess

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to do my best
Get my head up out the stress
When the money turns the world
Your loving turns to less

[Verse 3]
I learn by mistakes
Most of it is yours and
I'm done living life as a criminal
And I thought I'd die young just to please the old
Now I teach the young, I'm vitriol

[Chant]
Nanananananananana
Nanananananananana

[Chorus]
I'd rather go on
Go up and down
Turn myself all around
Then to stay down
I'd rather go on
Go up and down
Turn myself all around
Then to stay down

[Verse 4]
The war in me makes a warrior
Like a pitbull getting with a terrier
I'm better off in North Korea
Yeah, dropping from a barrel of a carrier

[Verse 5]
Coz I got enough to be more
It's hard enough to get more
I shut the door on everything
Just to let my head blow
Coz I got enough to be more
It's hard enough to get more
I shut the door on everything
Just to let my head blow

[Chant]
Nanananananananana
Nanananananananana

[Chorus]
I'd rather go on
Go up and down
Turn myself all around
Then to stay down
I'd rather go on
Go up and down
Turn myself all around
Then to stay down

[Verse 6]
Picture this, a dull grey street in the way
Neon signs gonna shine though
Shorty, you gonna shine though
Come up on ya treasure trove
Let the sun explode
Check up in the paper
In the Mirror for ya horoscope

[Verse 7]
Walking on a tightrope
Go for something I don't even know
Where to get it from
Sending out a signal
Smoke from a gun blow
As I knock off, knock off
Things that I don't want

[Chant]

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Kuntry had fronted me 20 ki's told me to keep 20 G's
Then forgot to tell me that it's 25 to eternity
Now picture me, in a GS3 with all my folk
Versace Coat, and a Monte 'Lo from slangin' coke
This ain't no joke situation nigga, I'm ill with it
My occupation? clockin' 6 figures, so deal with it
My Marc Buchanan Pelle Pelle over Teflon, protect my belly
From 9 millimeter cannon, while talkin' on celly telly's
Niggas frontin' like they makin' pay, this real pimpin'
Ki's comin straight from the CIA and Bill Clinton
You petty thugs ain't got a clue do you?
Hey who the man who supply the man who supplying you...
With a couple grand?
To risk your freedom for some luxuries? this ain't the best
Nigga materialistics can't substitute for your happiness
Life's about how you feel about you and what you do
When you wake up in the morning
In the mirror, you seeing who?
I think you niggas done bit off more than you can chew
Cause you don't even know why you do
Half that hot ass shit you do
Why I'm trappin'? cause it's the only job with fair taxes
And it keep a nigga tight to death in Polos and Air Max's
I'm blastin' these niggas daily, whenever they try to play me
Baby you wanna lay me, but baby you gotta pay me
Nigga you owe me cheese?, that's grounds for beef
I'm rollin' with the P$C with a pound to chief
Hey if this rap shit don't work?, I'm stuck slangin' drugs
Until I.. make enough money to go and buy me a club
I got.. 36 ounces that I got to move
And 20 ki's coming to me on the 4th of June
Soon as the school year ends, I pick up my ki's
So crank the V12, put down the females, replace 'em with cheese
200 G's for the package, but they 10.5 a piece, now
On the streets they goin' for 21.5 at least
Hey
21.5 x 20? look, that's 430
But listen closer cause the dope game get more dirty
If I cut 'em into ounces, 28 grams for $800 a piece
Hey, 36 of them in a ki, more cheese for me !
Now there's 28 G's and 800 cash
Just for one ki, and I got 19 more stashed
28 g's at 800, times 19 mo' ?
Come up to 5-4-7 comma 2-0-0
That's 547 G's and two hunna
47 G's used to ball, 200 to get blunted
The other 500 G's? invest it in ki's
So I can triple my cheese and have a million with ease
That's how it is
This game ain't no life time deal
You better get as much cheese as you can and get the fuck outta here
That's how it is
This game ain't no life time deal
You better get as much cheese as you can and get the fuck outta here
Yeaaa

[Intro]
Am-a-ri-llo

[Verse 1]
The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come
I got lost on the highway
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

[Verse 2]
Oh, Lord, send me transmissions
Forgive me for what I've become
The Son has come to save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul
The Son has come to save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul

[Outro]
Oh don't you know why
I need her loving you
Float inside

[Intro]
I got her singing (I got her singing)
I got her singing (I got her singing)
I got her singing (I got her singing)
I got her singing
Oh-oh-oh (I got her singing), I got her singing
Oh-oh-oh (I got her singing), I got her singing
Oh-oh-oh (I got her singing), I got her singing
Oh-oh-oh (I got her singing), yeah

[Verse 1]
Soon as I step out the whip, they spot me
Girls snapping pictures like the paparazzi
So many different type of women I'm into
And I can't take 'em all with me is my only issue
I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
And show them how to do the chocha, hit it like Sosa
I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
'Cause they know what I'm thinking, they look better naked

[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many ladies
Up in this club I can choose from
And they all look amazing
That's why it's so hard to just pick one

[Chorus]
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio
And can't get enough of me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me

[Verse 2]
All this bottle popping got me feeling nicely
Leaving by myself is highly unlikely
Looking for a right now, don't need no wifey
Settling down with one chick, that ain't even like me
So many women in the atmosphere (Atmosphere)
Gotta leave with at least three and a pair (Three and a pair)
The look in they eyes telling me that they want it
Don't like it that much to put a ring on it

[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many ladies
Up in this club I can choose from
And they all look amazing
That's why it's so hard to just pick one (Pick one)

[Chorus]
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies (Oh)
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio
And can't get enough of me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me (Oh)
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me

[Bridge]
When I'm whispering in your ear
Know I got you listening, baby
I know you liking what you hear
Now let's leave up out of here, baby
When I'm whispering in your ear
Know I got you listening, baby
'Cause when I put my hands on you
Girl, I'm gonna drive your body crazy, oh

[Chorus]
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules (When I get 'em off in this room, yeah)
And girl singing melodies (Girl singing melodies)
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio (Oh, no)
And can't get enough of me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me (Woo!)
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules (When I get you off in this room)
And girl singing melodies (I'ma lay my hands on you)
And it sounding like your favorite song playing on the radio (I'ma give you what you need)
And can't get enough of me (And 'bout to guarantee, baby)
I had a girl singing like me (I got her singing like me, baby)
I had a girl singing like me (Singing like me)

(I got her singing like me) Make ya do what it do
(I got her singing like me) Oh, give it to me, baby
(I got her singing like me) Yeah
(I got her singing like me) Oh, give it to me, baby
(I got her singing like me) Yeah, yeah
When I get you off to my room, baby, baby
When I get you off to my room, baby, oh, yeah, yeah
I got her singing, oh
I got her singing, oh

[Verse 1]
Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about it and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please

[Pre-Chorus]
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to

[Chorus]
Oh, you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Verse 2]
Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited

[Chorus]
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

[Bridge]
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends can watch me
Today
(Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel)

[Chorus]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 1]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Verse 2]
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 2]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time

[Verse 3]
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you goin' marry mines."
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined
As I feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—

[Chorus]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Post-Chorus 1]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Outro Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Hungry kids in the crib, ma
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
When the craving's got a hold of you
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
And your munchies get a attitude
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot

And I eat them smokin' hot cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: DeStorm]
Yo, I'm a hot dude, with some hot dreams
Gettin' fired up, lettin' off steam
Everybody's showin' love, Herby's in the tub
Checkin' applications for the Hot Pocket fan club
Pepperoni pizza much better than some fish eggs
Interior too hot, let's cool it off for a few secs
I'm runnin' for the taste, that could be my phys ed
Jumpin' hot pockets, that's how you get ahizzead
Yo, ? get the meaty-meats, winners get the cheesy eats
The tag-team meal that's too hot for TV
Get off my pockets, you gotta back up
Yeah that's wassup, now sign the pre-nups
Me and Hot Pockets is never gon' split up (Never gon' split up)
You should think about it, take a second

[Break: Andy Milonakis]
Hot Pockets, herb sauce (Cheesy drizzle)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I bring the heat, but y'all knew that
The big sauce boss, yeah I had to do that
I keep it fired up, even when I'm inside
You take what's mine, then you're gonna have to run and hide

[Verse 3: Andy Milonakis]
He light 'em up so much that everybody talks
They all wanna turn in his Hot Pockets box
Two to the one-one, yup, three
This Hot Pockets are so H-O-double-T
Smoky tabs hittin' that three thirty-three
(You can't stand this hot then you can't chill with me)
So bring your friends, we goin' on a wild ride
Herb sauce, tender meats heat up your inside

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a lizzle
Got some cheesy drizzle, drippin' on my shizzle
Waitin' on the brizzle, the prizzle, the gizzle G's
When the cheese hits your tongue you'll scream, "Fo' shizzle"

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Hungry kids in the crib, ma
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
When the craving's got a hold of you
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
And your munchies get a attitude
Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
I got the pockets in my arms, settin' off smoke alarms
And I eat them smokin' hot cause I got it goin' on

[Intro]
Piss off, cake

[Verse 1]
Too many people going underground
Too many reaching for a piece of cake
Too many people pulled and pushed around
Too many waiting for that lucky break

[Chorus]
That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two

[Verse 2]
Too many people sharing party lines
Too many people never sleep-in late
Too many people paying parking fines
Too many hungry people losing weight

[Chorus]
That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Too many people preaching practices
Don't let them tell you what you wanna be
Too many people holding back
This is crazy, and baby, it's not like me

[Chorus]
That was your last mistake
I find my love awake and waiting to be
Now what can be done for you?
She's waiting for me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Light the weed
Wish that you would stay, you got the right to leave
It's who I'd like to be
You say I may be losin' sight of things, and I might agree
But we livin' in a digital world
You told me that you wasn't a material girl
Then I realized those don't exist
Freedom of the mind, that's the only bliss
And they told me, "No," but I did it, ain't got shit for these bitches
Livin' life with no limits, days becomin' so different
Get money, fuck hoes, when your eatin', your stomach grow
Who is that? Love to know
It's perfect here, it doesn't show
Makin' music just because I love to
If you hatin' on me, sayin', "Fuck you"
And it's simple, but it means a lot
This is what I do, I don't need to talk

[Verse 2]
Ya, I tried to do a lot of things
Couldn't focus on everything
I think I'm really good at many things
A phone's calling, that's the devil's ring
I'm not gonna answer that phone
I'm ready to go back home
Been on this road for so long, that all I do is sit and make sad songs
What the fuck happened to that nice kid
That you knew when he released that mixtape called K.I.D.S
And everybody thought that he would be so big
Until he lost focus 'cause he got so sick
Of all the bullshit that they always do, tell you what you gotta do
Everybody's watching you, and you just wanna scream an Awprah
I think I need to see a doctor

[Outro]
Keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', yo, I got somethin' to say
When this motherfuckin' hook ends, I got somethin' to say
I'm not finished, I ain't slowin' down for nothin'
This my motherfuckin' time, and I'ma do this shit
'Cause I was meant to do this motherfuckin' shit
Yeah, motherfu—uh, shit, yeah, uh
The funny thing—the funny thing is
This song isn't just a song because I dreamed of this song
In past days and I woke up and it was the future
It's funny when the future is things you dreamed
Because you never understand what they mean at the time
But then in the forward of motion of seconds and minutes and hours
You finally realized that they were all secret messages
From people you don't know but you might have seen in a past life or a life in the future
Or whatever the fuck this whole thing means that you just will never figure out
So stop trying!

[Intro]
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I don’t know why…

[Chorus]
You can be the boss, daddy

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

[Verse 1]
He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, “Do you want it?”
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, I’m beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it

[Pre-Chorus]
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

[Verse 2]
He has a white corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, know, I saw it
He’s bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He’s sick and he’s taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can’t resist
As close as I’ll get to the darkness
He tells me to, “Shut up, I got this”

[Pre-Chorus]
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…

[Chorus]
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

[Bridge]
I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You’re wrong but you’re so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean
To keep 'em keen
But you, you're not that nice
But you taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…

[Chorus]
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
If you know me, you know I'm 'bout my bread
I count a hundred million dollars 'fore I go to bed
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne
I'm standing on the couch just throwing up my damn gang
I'm out in A town, 'bout to go to Mansion
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin' new
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like "What you tryin' to do?"
I brought the whole thang so that's what I'ma smoke
I spent the whole thang, I'm never going broke
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking 'til I croak
Smokin' 'til I choke, my watch need a vote, oh

On vacation weed in rotation
Relaxation, trippy nation
Chasing bands, model chicks
Look like Sports Illustrated
I'm getting high as a plane
With no final destination
On that gin, on that Hen
And that lean intoxication (You know it)
Rocking dollars, rocking gold
Money tall like Manute Bol
In a presidential suite
With some Playmate centerfolds
Niggas out here chasin' ass
But they should be chasin' cash
I be smoking 'til it's gone
Juicy J don't waste no gas (Waste no gas)
With her legs lift up (Oh)
I thought it was a stick up (Oh)
Should've seen them hoes that pick up
Bands hard to lift up (Damn)
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee (Uh)
They call me the money tree (The money tree)
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I be overseas, I be in L.A.  
I be in the South, trappin' hard all day

I don't really gotta say much

That's what these racks for

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I get fly for the studio
I get fly for the airport
I get fly everywhere I go, oh, oh
30 bottles up in Greystone
In the club rollin' airplanes
You gettin' money, you already know, oh, oh
So much Cris, you would think we buy it wholesale
And my crib so big, look like a hotel
When we leave here, we smokin' out the hotel
When we leave ain't no tellin' who pay the whole bill
'Cause we all gettin' money, uh

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I don't really gotta say much

I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks for (Hahahaha)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm a broke nigga's nightmare, broke hoes sight stare
And a walking bank roll, as long as the dank rolled
It's gon' be hard to hear you niggas
Louis frames so I don't have to see you niggas
Me and the Taylor Gang floatin' on a private plane
Bad bitch, gimme brain, hide behind this tinted thing
Money bag, kush cologne, niggas wonder what I be on
All about the Benjies, nigga, Puffy Combs
I can make an actress do backflips on mattress
I can make a sack do a back flip on Saks Fifth
Get trippy with a star, it will get you far
Turnt up in the club, TMZ outside my car

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
I don't really gotta say much
I let my pack talk
I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks for (Crops)

[Verse 3: Problem]
Catch me at the spot with more angels than Charlie
Take off, Cookies, kush, kilos, and mollies
Smelling like money, what a elegant fragrance
This watch I got on is a hell of a statement
Check the clock, you know the time
Girl, fuck your body, I want you mind
In need of getting this money, making and spending this money
Ain't part of your daily plan? Then you should probably die

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I don't really gotta say much
I let my pack talk
I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks for

Lookin' for your baby-mama, that bitch with me
Say I'm gon' get her high, she gon' fuck for free
Man, she looks much better when she on her knees
Put her on the cabbage, I don't do the babbage
Smokin' all the green, rockin' all these karats

Make weed disappear, do you believe in magic? (You believe in magic?)

So I rode by where we used to stay
Real talk, mhm
Ooh-hoo, hah

[Hook: French Montana, Wiz Khalifa]
I pull up with your bitch in the Rolls
Don't even get it twisted 'cause it's already rolled
Ain't nothin' like the rest of 'em, you rollin' with the best though
Rollin' up the best smoke, rollin' up the best smoke
I pull up with your bitch in the Rolls
Don't even get it twisted 'cause it's already rolled
Ain't nothin' like the rest of 'em, you rollin' with the best though
Rollin' up the best smoke, rollin' up the best smoke

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Doin' a hundred through the desert
Yeah my car come from the past, you could call it a time machine
'Cause it's right here in the present
In the game and I got leverage
Ain't the same as none of you niggas
If I was close to you I would be 'shamed of you
Get a hundred mill's what I came to do
I guess all this money look lame to you
So I spend it on shoppin', all of this shit that I'm coppin'
Don't even go to the store, my outfit it ain't even droppin'
Pedal to the floor, smokin' in my new SS
Seen a lot of bumps on the road to success
But that ain't stop a nigga from cruisin' up
Pullin' weed out the ashtray, cuttin' the music up
Smokin', chillin'
Used to be underground but now we on top of the buildin'

[Hook: French Montana, Wiz Khalifa]
I pull up with your bitch in the Rolls (Uh)
Don't even get it twisted 'cause it's already rolled
Ain't nothin' like the rest of 'em, you rollin' with the best though (Ha)
Rollin' up the best smoke, rollin' up the best smoke (Ha)
I pull up with your bitch in the Rolls
Don't even get it twisted 'cause it's already rolled
Ain't nothin' like the rest of 'em, you rollin' with the best though
Rollin' up the best smoke, rollin' up the best smoke (Ha)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Never had a limit (Ha), small face spender (Ha)
Everything was cashed out, I ain't ever rent it
Brown bag sinner (Ha), shawty love a winner
Beat that pussy up, now that pussy trendin'
Pull up in the dealer (Dealer) lookin' like a dealer (Dealer)
Young nigga, high as shit, five hundred milla
Need me on it? Then you gotta step the bill up (Ah)
Winter time, hoodie on, drop chinchilla (Ah)
Lookin' like a killer (Ah)
Used to hit the block, fiends lookin' like Thriller (Ah)
Shooter like Miller, nah I mean Billups (Billups)
Pull up in the Porsches (Porsches), bad bitch talkin' 'bout 500 horses
Started from the bottom, nigga was a filler (Filler)
Now you need my name so your show could fill up
Keep my cup fill up, black card to fill up
Nigga small-talkin', tell 'em put a mill up (Ah)

[Hook: French Montana, Wiz Khalifa]
I pull up with your bitch in the Rolls
Don't even get it twisted 'cause it's already rolled
Ha, ah
I met a little girl, sure was fine
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home, and made love to me
I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me, don't think I'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last
Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid

Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you

Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
To love, hold, and cherish for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
Cause I love you

1964
Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you

1976

Then time would change you
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And as I sing this song right now I wonder today
If you're a friend of mine

Cry cry cry-I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?

Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free
Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free

[Verse]
Out of this zone, trying to see
I'm so alone, nothing for me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Oh, this old tree, lonely old me
Whoopsie-daisy, I thought I was happy, oh
Out of this zone, now that I see
I don't need them and they don't need me
I guess I'll go home, try to be sane
Try to pretend, none of it happened
Destined to be, lonely old me
Whoopsie-daisy,I thought I was happy, oh

[Chorus]
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me? (I thought I was happy)
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?

[Bridge]
But I don't really care about it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any of them say
They just talk about themselves all day
One day I'll be a star, they'll be sorry

[Chorus]
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?
Ah, why won't they talk to me?

[Verse 1]
This ain't appropriate now
Push my hand off your side
There’s no one else around
I just wanna tease your eyes
Maybe we can check these locks
I just wanna go inside
Why's it so dead on a Friday night?
I guess the morning’s here if we wait like five

[Chorus]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details

[Post-Chorus]
What had happened to the time we had?
I thought you said you won't ever
(I know I promised to wait)
Won't ever leave me
(He just means so much more to me than you do)
What happened to us?
(I want– did try
I know, I, I want– did try)

[Verse 2]
Okay, I’ll take you back
Alright, let’s pick up where we started
Don’t think that’s in my head
I’m not a bit cold-hearted
Save yourself tonight
Tomorrow, I'll get you back
I don't think I have your problem
(I don't think I have your problem)
I don't think I have a problem
I don't think I mean to fuss
I don't want to bother you
And there is no reason to rush

[Chorus]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details

[Post-Chorus]
What had happened to a time we had?
I thought you said you won't ever
Won't ever leave me
What happened to us?
What happened to us?
What happened to?

[Chorus]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can't describe
So many details
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details

[Spoken Intro]
You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real
I mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

[Verse 1]
Ooh now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again, again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it

Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby
Ooh if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time

Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part

[Bridge]
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how hard I tried, really tried
(All that rehearsing, baby)
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized, my name

[Verse 2]
What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine

Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side
Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied

Still I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life

I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight

It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest

[Refrain/Outro]
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
Whoa, I was a fool from the start
Fooling around with my mind instead of my heart
I was young and fine and you plucked me clean
Oh but you didn't know that, I didn't know that
You didn't know what I mean

You know, you had a brother who thought he was cool
But really, I was a dumb little fool
You said you'd never, never go away
And stay beside me night and day
You said you would love and obey
Well, you should, well, you should
Now, it can only get you good

I was a dumb little fool
I was a dumb little fool
But I'll never get enough, get enough
Enough of that funky stuff
I'm gonna jump back in
Up to my neck again
You always knew that I
Wasn't that kind of guy
All the times I thought you knew
Well, I was busy loving you
What was you afraid to lose
Everybody's got to choose
I don't know if I'm
Gonna get a yea or nay
Or if I'm gonna do
What his honor say

(Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous
Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous)

But if I decide, baby, what you want
I wanna know if you would be satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Would you be satisfied
Satisfied

Is that enough, baby
Is that enough
Last you a lifetime
Is that enough
Is that enough
Keep you happy
Is that enough
You know I do it
And I know that you just love that expensive stuff
You got a flair for style
And the style is all the while
What could I do
The judge said she got to keep on living the way she accustomed to
She trying to break a man
I don't understand
Somebody tell me please, tell me please
Why do I have to pay attorney fees (My baby's)
Attorney fees (Ooh baby)
This is a joke
I need a smoke
Wait a minute
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations

Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you

Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you’re sick of all this repetition

Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic

Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody ya' don’t have to speak to

Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Aw, won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Verse 1]
Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mister Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
He's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (Yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing when they saw him again
That's how it is 'til the end (Yeah)

[Intro]
Ayo, Josh
Ayo, where the fuck you at, man?
What you mean you on your way, yo?
Our session was at nine, it's fuckin' eleven
I'm out here blowed, smokin L's, waitin' for your ass
I don't even think I got—
Oh no, I definitely still got some weed for the lab
But still, when you gon' be here?
Soon? Motherfucker, how soo—oh, there you are right now
Ayo, what's good, bruh?
This is a DJ Haze exclusive (Hello?)
Ayo, what's good, bruh?
Shit, chillin'
Yeah, I'm tryin' to go to the studio or whatever
Yeah, I got shit to drop, motherfucker
I always got shit to drop, damn
Aight, you'll meet me there? Aight

[Verse]
I woke up, scratched my nuts, rolled a Swisher on the shitter, ha
Got blowed, then I light me up a cigarette
The coolest flow, 

[?] movie role
Now I'm tryna head up to the lab
I headed to the studio, open the door
Say, "What's up?" to everybody who was posted before
I'm 'bout to record, they know I'm smokin', of course
Blow some haze in the air, pull out my notebook
Then I head up to the booth, load the beat off my email
Phone on silent, ignorin' calls from females
My man Josh sit down, get the tempo
Put on my headphones, aight, let's go (Do it)
I let go, intro of the beat's startin'
Say a couple words, try not to be retarded, ha
'Cause I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do
Eatin' tracks up like some snacks, call me Scooby-Doo
Now the beat about to drop, verse one
It's like a war when the soldier pull the first gun
Everything blank, it's me and the mic
I don't read a lot, so I try and see what I write (Visualize)
Visualize the melody, hypnotize
Everybody watchin', I hope they ain't blink they eyes
'Cause you don't wanna miss a fuckin' second when I'm catchin' wreck
I be in the booth goin' off, try and catch my breath
Couple more bars, couple seconds left
Killin' 'em softly, takin' extra steps
They never guessed I'd be murderin' and blessin'
Aight, the first done, but before we start the second
We gotta do mad shit, doubles and ad-libs
And Josh make it sound like magic
He a old school genius with the Pro Tools
Try and school me on everything that the pros do
I tell him that he needs to think it in the book
But for now we makin' guap, just singin' on some hooks
So I don't worry 'bout the chorus, the track got a hook on it
And my verses with that, they sound good on it (Uh-huh)
Now I do a second, maybe do a third
If I'm in the mood to go crazy with my words (Yeah)
I take a little break, got some haze to burn
The cats sittin' outside can wait they turn (Wait, bitch)
We makin' classics in the session, mom's askin' me these questions
"When you comin' home? You got school" Ha, nah, I'm suspended
After this track done, burn the last blunt, smokin' good
Payin' for my time with stolen goods
Say peace to whoever, outside it's dark
I'm blowed and can't find where the fuck I parked
So I beep the car, oh, there it is
Let's go ahead and dip, hop in the whip, light a cigarette and sit
Got a ride home ahead of us, slumped in the back
Tell my mans with the whip to bump on my track
I'm tryna ride out, and I'm high now
I'm out

[Intro]
Fuck you mean, "I'm drunk," mo'fugga?
You crazy?
Shit, you didn’t say that a hour ago!

[Verse 1]
Uh, I made more than this money (Whoa), don't label me as no business (No)
Came up in this country, started out in the Civic (Yup)
Pray for rain 'til it's muddy (Muddy), prayin' more than just Sunday (Sunday)
Eatin' good, I'm still hungry, left no evidence on these dishes (Clean)
Watchin' movies, no sound (Nope), smokin' weed in this dope house (Dope)
And my bitch coked out, smoke loud when she go down (Suck a dick, bitch)
Damn, this the life (Life), ridin' on Gary Fisher bikes (Skrrt)
Know the kid is nice, piece of cake, you won't get a slice (Bitch)
Any time of night, hide your kids, hide your wife (Oh)
Find a sip, bottle Sprite (Oh), high as shit, blind a bitch, dynamite (Bang)
Bitch, tell me what your problems like (I wanna know, for real)
Just grab the pipe, we could talk all night
Sike

[Chorus]
I get money, I fuck hoes (Ya)
I wear really nice clothes, I
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (All of it!)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Bitch!)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)
I get money, I fuck hoes
I wear really nice clothes, I (They're expensive!)
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (Cash, motherfucker)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Slut-ass hoes)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)

[Verse 2]
Why the fuck did I start this? (Uh,) Now I'm spittin' retarded (Huh?)
That bassline, made that, that's the hardest (Yeah, it is)
Regardless, I could get this yardage (Ya)
'Cause I'm a quarterback, bitch, gimme my quarter back (Now)
Change, vendin' machine, make it rain (Wow)
Buyin' out the whole bottom floor, buyin' out the whole bottom drawer (Wow)
Buyin' out the whole bottom row
There's ice in my mouth right now (There's ice in my mouth right now)
Lemme chew that shit, bitch, I'm cold (Whoa)
Yeah, I'm cold, all you rappers, you old
Don't go to award shows 'cause they smell like nursing homes (Gross)
Yeah, never wanna get nominated
Yeah, I do, I'm just pissed I haven't got nominated

[Chorus]
I get money, I fuck hoes (Ya)
I wear really nice clothes, I
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (All of it!)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Bitch!)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)
I get money, I fuck hoes
I wear really nice clothes, I (They're expensive!)
Go to the club and buy all Patrón (Cash, motherfucker)
I get a lot of
Bitches who love to suck my dick (Slut-ass hoes)
I made a lot of money
I'm real motherfuckin' rich (I'm so motherfuckin' rich!)

[Verse 1]
I work in the dead of night
When the roads are quiet and no one is around
To track my moves, racing the yellow lights
To find the gate is open, she's waiting in the room
I just slip on through

[Pre-Chorus]
You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

[Verse 2]
Enter the morning light
To find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
In a little white room
No I'm not alone, her head is heavy on me
She's sleeping like a child
What could I do?

[Pre-Chorus]
You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

[Chorus]
I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

[Bridge]
Suddenly I'm in over my head and I can hardly breathe
Suddenly I'm floating over her bed and I feel everything
Suddenly I know exactly what I did, but I can not move a thing
And suddenly I know exactly what I'd done
And what it's going to mean to me, mean to me
I'm gone

[Chorus]
I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

[Outro]
She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin and she had a job to do

[Intro]
Kingston, let’s go!

[Verse 1]
Round of applause because that body needs a hand
(Clap it up for that body, clap it up for that body)
Shots at the bar no chases baby I’m a man
(Take a shot of Bacardi, take a shot of Bacardi)

[Pre-Chorus]
Raybans on cause I’m way to drunk, so bailare
Eight fingers on, got drink in my cup, so bailare
Show up, and I don’t give fuck, so bailare
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck

[Chorus]
I pull up in a matte black truck, like a rock star
Feeling like a million bucks
Shades on, drink in my hand
The only thing I need is Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans

[Verse 2]
Round of applause because that body needs a hand
(Clap it up for that body, clap it up for that body)
No, really baby, like to touch it if I can
Why don’t we leave the party, and we can get real naughty

[Pre-Chorus]
Raybans on cause I’m way to drunk, so bailare
Eight fingers on, got drink in my cup, so bailare
Show up, and I don’t give fuck, so bailare
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck
Throw up and I don’t give a fuck

[Chorus]
I pull up in a matte black truck, like a rock star
Feeling like a million bucks
Shades on, drink in my hand
The only thing I need is Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans

[Bridge: Cher Lloyd]
Step into mi casa, mi casa
Take a peek, boy I know you want to
We can dance all night long until the morn
With nothing but our shades on
Nothing but our shades on
Nothing but our shades on

[Chorus]
Rum and Raybans
Let’s go
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans
Rum and Raybans

[Intro]
See most of y'all sucka ass niggas wouldn't last a week in my hood
If you was broke and wouldn't last a day if you had money
I seen grown men cry, grown men die, for the love of that money
In God we trust!

[Verse 1]
My trigger finger itchin', palms itchin' too
We back-to-back in Ghosts, playin' peek-a-boo
We went to war with Sosa over a brick or two
So for a hundred ki's, think what my clique could do
I'm talkin' clappin' toasts, bullets'll hit your roof
They hit his body he went in shock, no Pikachu
Niggas ain’t bout it they talkin’ but really pick and choose
We on our second strike, we ain’t got shit to lose
All my niggas is felons, all you niggas is tellin’
Sold your soul to them people, they gon’ get you to sell it
They gon’ get you to move it, they gon’ get you a Buick
They gon’ get you a wire, like niggas gon’ use it
You gon’ tell on your brothas, what a lame homie
I got a bullet with your name on it, and a full clip I autographed
Kids cryin’ at the viewing, I guess it was sorta sad

[Hook]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust

[Verse 2]
Lotta niggas act Tony-like
Told them D's everything you heard but that’s your homie right
But he got killers lurkin’ outside at your home tonight
They gon’ hit the crib and kill the kids, oh that’s Kony right
Oh that’s Kony-like, everybody bleed
Cuz he come out in 2060, Christmas Eve
First time he went to prison he ain’t get to leave
Feds takin’ pictures, niggas is rats, you should say cheese
Once a local dude, shit the fire now
Never ever spit a rap but he got bars now
I’m talkin fed time, yard up, yard down
Baby mama can’t pay the bills, shit is hard now
How that make you feel, you should pay them bills
Inmates spittin in them trays when they make yo’ meal
Niggas shittin’ out them packs just to take them pills
And his baby mama brought em in, boy this shit is real
Niggas turn to Muslim, niggas turn to Christian
They gave him life, he try’n appeal it, got him on a mission
His homies ain’t learn, they still in the kitchen
They firin’ bullshit, that coka ain’t swimmin’
It’s coming up short, no food on the fork
Niggas is catchin’ cases, niggas is goin’ to court
He done slaved in the field, you the one on the porch
With the gun in your hand, try and run with the man

[Hook]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust

[Outro]
Hey look, I’ma tell you like this
If you in school nigga, stay in school
If you got a job nigga, stay at work
If you a family man, stay with your muhfuckin’ family nigga
Cuz this shit ain’t meant for everybody dawg
Everybody talk that shit, until they get caught up in some real shit
And then they start talkin’ that shit

[Hook]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust

[Verse 1]
It really hurt me when they killed Shaddy
I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it
And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly
We was young and gettin' money, man we used to run the city
We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes
And when they killed Darryl, Renee had to see him froze on the ground
Downtown, I can hear the sounds now
When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
'Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
'Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tak in his eyes
Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know I'ma ride
Hope you hear me, I'ma kill you nigga
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 2]
And I ain't ready
Niggas wanna murder me I'm ridin' around heavy
I think they wanna wet me like New Orleans and the levees
But I got this Mac-Elev-y, these niggas'll never get me
Lord knows, I got alotta homies in the dirt
Niggas sprayin' metal tryna take you off the earth
Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth
Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt
I rose from the jungle like Derrick
Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future looking brighter than this rose I'm staring at
We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish
Rest in peace to my niggas, I swear I miss them to death
My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death
I'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest
'Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell & Ness
I'm gone

[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 3]
Man my life so real
Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills
Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil
And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill
Man I almost got murked in front of the same church
My dad got carried in, family got married in
That was in my older days, this is now, that was then
Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion
Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant
Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em
Lock 'em like a terrier, breakin' all barriers
Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius
'Cause cops tryna catch me, niggas tryna clap me
Haters runnin at me, know they wanna get at me
And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy
I did it for my niggas, and I did this shit for Kathy

[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 1]
Money make the world go round
And all the pretty girls go down
And I still roll round through my old hood in my new whip
All white ghost I call it my cool whip
Hundred on my neck lookin’ like I move bricks
My life is like a movie, every day a new script
And ain’t it funny how this money make a mood switch
Cuz they be talkin’ beef, I be up in Ruth’s Chris
Who is this at the door, I think it’s the devil don’t let him in
Just rap and take my niggas to places we never been
And when it comes to cake I get it like Entenmann's
With the heart of a lion, no lyin’ I never been
No folks for these fuckboys
On my second mil and I ain’t talkin’ lunch boy
Glock 30 ridin’ dirty and it's tucked boy
Cuz I could treat you like a priest get you touched boy
No homo
Before I had a deal I was poppin’, no promo
All of a sudden all these bad bitches want a photo
M’s in my account and M’s in the logo
So everytime I spend a hundred k I scream YOLO

[Hook]
Young kings, young kings
I be rollin’ with some young kings, young kings
And all we know is one thing, one thing
Get the money nigga fuck fame, and fuck fame
I be rollin’ with some young kings, young kings

And all we know is one thing, one thing
Get the money nigga fuck fame, and fuck fame

[Verse 2]
Crowns on my wrist and my head

It’s money on my mind, make me put it on your head
And have your own homies lookin’ at you like you’re bread
Tryna eat nigga, I’m from Philly so you know I play for keeps nigga
Six pallbearers, six feet deep nigga
No insurance you been sitting six weeks nigga
Big 40 knock you right up out your sneaks nigga
Young kings, all I know is one thing
Live life, one dream, started in the drug game
Where they never make it out unless you got a gun game
Walkin’ through my city but it’s lookin’ like I run things
Runnin’ shit, diarrhea
And ever since my dad died I ran out of fear
G5 through the sky boy we outta here
Sippin PJ fresh from out the PJ

[Hook]
Young kings, young kings
I be rollin’ with some young kings, young kings
And all we know is one thing, one thing
Get the money nigga fuck fame, and fuck fame

[Verse 3]
I still wake up go and get it, youngin on a mission
Cuz when niggas was eating they left me to do the dishes
But I’m different, I still put ‘em on just to show ‘em right
I used to be the dark child but now I glow at night
I keep a Omelly by my side because we both alike
Try and keep that nigga out the field cuz he be throwin’ white
Dishin’ d, tryna get rich as me
I’m worth a couple million man that shit was meant to be
20 gold chains on, shit I think I’m Mr. T
If I could live my life again I wouldn’t do it differently
Prolly bring my father back, just so he could witness me
Back up in my zone I swear my haters is history
Bitches say they missin’ me, I never fall for it
Cuz they just miss the money, they know I go hard for it
And if my niggas need it, I tell ‘em come for it
Cuz when it comes to me, they shootin’ like a small forward, swish

[Hook]
Young kings, young kings

[Intro: Omelly]
See real niggas come first cause we men of respect
And do what we want in these streets
And dope boys come second
Cause money make the motherfucking world go round
And fly niggas come third cause he might ain’t got no money
But he still can pull the baddest bitch in the building
We killing these streets nigga
Treat the motherfucking Ghost like a Grand Marquis
Walk up with at least 20 deep and we order a feast

[Verse 1]
I come straight from the ghetto, I'm ballin hard as I wanna
And I'm thankful as ever that we ain't all on the corner
Dodgin' death and the system, yeah the refs with the whistles
Cause these suckas is foul they disrespect us we hit em'
Niggas claiming they real, they wrist and neck ain't official
They got me out in the field, a nigga back on his gristle
Going hard with them hammers my niggas all in the slammer
Niggas want catch me slippin' but I don't walk on bananas
I'm out here strapped-er than velcro, and no I don't sell dough
But I spit that raw shit, it's like I sell coke
Put one in your head nigga like right where the shell go
Got one in the chamber, yea we on point like an elbow
Bulletproof Range when I pull it shoot thangs
Hit em close range, let him feel the blue flame
Every month I buy a new car, a new chain
And I don't never fuck no bummy hoes that count they loose change

[Hook]
Real nigga come first (first) and dope boy come second (second)
Fly nigga come third and I keep birds all in my words (in my words)
I keep birds all in my words (and them people tapping my line man that shit bad for my nerves)
Real bitches come first (first), bad bitches come second (second)
Freak bitches come third and I keep birds all in my words
I got Percs all in my system and apple juice in my syrup
And these suckers talkin this money shit, y’all niggas got some nerve

[Verse 2]
I try to keep my bitches all on lay away (lay away)
And if you fuck me good, you getting paid today (paid today)
This Aude on my wrist, it cost me 80k
And I ain’t got no ice in it, rollin out the light tinted
So these niggas see me (see me), sway em like graffiti (fiti)
I get what I wanna (wanna), like I own a genie (genie)
Niggas hating on me (on me)
Know they wanna be me, at the table with my niggas, eatin' lobster & linguine
And that pussy smell like Fiji
Boy, I’ll just go swimming
Everything foreign from the Porsches to the women
I’m early in the morning, with the coca, trying to flip it
Nigas say they want the money but they don’t wanna go and get it
That’s why real nigga come first (first), dope boy come second (second)
Fly nigga come third and I was out there on that curb
With mailbox so close with me, I’m picture word that I’m worth
Talkin late nights you don’t play right, that kitchen wearin that work
Go!

[Hook]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Aye, shorty I'mma tell you like this

But, uh

I can introduce you to a lifestyle you gon' love forever
It's Double-M-G

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?

Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?

Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
I wanna buy your...

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Riding through my city with a chick I used to lust
Bout to make a movie starring me, the two of us
Penthouse at the top floor, elevator shooters up
So I can eat that pussy for breakfast, dinner, and lunch
And uh, she been waiting all night for this hard pipe
I think she called twice
Before you knew it I pulled in she seen them fog lights
And I can see it in her face she had a hard night
Up and down that pole selling dreams, selling love
It was sort of like she serving fiends and selling drugs
Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like
She be on that pole, tryna chase her goals
Going up and down like that angel on that Rolls. Lord Knows!

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?
I wanna buy your love, everything is on me
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
I wanna buy your...

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, Shorty so pretty and that pussy so good
She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in an Aston, she heard the pipes they were growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' Lear in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder in Bal Harbour out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes
Hella Jewels, Money come in different revenues
Big Paper, your money smaller then that Kevin dude

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?
I wanna buy your love, everything is on me
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?

Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
I wanna buy your...

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm getting Madden money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate
They call me racked up shorty, she can smell the Aura
Had her out in Bora exploring like she was Dora
Million dollar sponsor, spoiled her like my daughter
And put her in the game, She ain't fucking with lames

[Hook: Louie V]
I wanna buy your love, tell me what it's gon' be?
I wanna buy your love, everything is on me
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
Lifestyle of the rich and the famous
Don't you wanna be rich and be famous?
I wanna buy your...
Yeah, yeah
I remember...

[Verse 1]
I remember nights I used to sell rock
Posted on the corner like a mailbox
First class ticket to a cell block
Just to get some Polo and some shell tops
Cold world and they say hell's hot
But it ain't hotter than that choppa when them shells drop
Man I seen niggas play that block and get they bell rocked
Cops cleared the scene and I was back by twelve o'clock
Tryna get it, Dickies on and my fitted
Gun in my draws, ducking the law, I'm all with it
Money, cars and clothes, I wanted 'em all nigga
I never was good at hoopin', I wanted to ball nigga
Cause the OG's sold keys and I had no cheese
Coppers lock me, beat me down like I was Cochise
Old fiends coppin' work through their old dreams
They got shattered, it ain't matter cause we thirst cream
Niggas serving niggas moms just to make a flip
Homies murder other homies just to make a brick
Most my niggas done got busted tryna take a hit
The feds were lurking, we was serving, they was taking flicks

[Chorus]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops

[Verse 2]
I done seen close neighbors lose hope
Fall victim to the streets and start to use dope
I used to load my gun before I went to school first
It's crazy niggas wanna kill me, we was cool first
And when it comes to friends you can't let 'em too close
That's why they call 'em close friends
You turn your back they move first
And I just bought a new Ghost
And a crib out on that new coast
And it all started from a dolla
Running from the law, scuffing up my Pradas
Crack all in my draws, tryna make a profit
All I wanted was some shells and some Polo for my closet, awhhh
Drug money, turn to blood money
I only roll with niggas that'll take a slug for me
No matter what it is, I'ma pay that bail money
To get my niggas right, my niggas for life!

[Chorus]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops

[Intro: Meek Mill]
One Night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Y'all was like my brothers
I considered y'all as folks
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts
Talking about the life, trying to get it slinging dope
Niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first
And fuck all this money nigga, we was fam first
Looking at me balling, know that Instagram hurt
Cuz you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn Ghost
I would have rolled for you even in the same hearse
Same cemetery, bury me in the same dirt
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work
"B.H we straight," that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow my nigga
I'm gone

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I can't believe you (not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do?
And when I came home I tried to feed you
And every song I was screeming free you (Free Dat Nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too
Now when I ride by I breeze through
I don't even stop, ain't a need to
And you the one that left nigga, I ain't leave you
Shit got realer, niggas got richer
I said the money train coming, niggas missed it
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They want more than my mother
More than Omelly, and that nigga like my brother
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate em, I still love em
I might have said things, I never said fuck em
But I'm a live my life, get the money, ball hard
Still sending earned money for his calling cards
Rick ain't complaining, he got life behind bars
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all
Cuz none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet
None of y'all niggas send him pics yet
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rains, niggas get wet
Gone

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I still love niggas
But its like we just grew apart
If you don't grind, you don't shine
Half my niggas still around, and we all shining hard
Gone

[Verse 1]
Paulie killed Tony right and Tony killed Ty so it was only right
Bring 'em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LOOORD)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now

[Verse 2]
Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on 'em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid 'em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on 'em
Said it's on now, try and kill 'em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now
Momma and little kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain it really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his Bimmer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done so he loadin' up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight he don't give a fuck if the law come

[Verse 3]
So he out here
Ridin' dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin 'em they tryna hit 'em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with 'em
Youngin' layin' low he know Paulie ain't playin' though
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin' go
But youngin' he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tag-toed
It was four in the morn', Paulie goin' home
Windshields wiping, middle of the rain storm
And Paulie he ain't slipping yeah he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block before he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear view it's like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezing, trying get him off him
Them shots ringing youngin' squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face, "you ain't learn from your brother nigga?"

[Intro Verse: Meek Mill]
Shorty bad as my son is, pretty face and no stomach
Was the city’s most wanted ‘til I said gimme yo number
Youngest nigga I’m stuntin’, no more Civics from Honda
Money come in abudance, that’s the reason she wanna

[Trey Songz]
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I keep a vest on my chest, to cover my heart
I’d rather fuck in the light, ‘fore I make love in the dark
Cuz she was fuckin’ me right, it felt like love from the start
Was gettin’ money on tour, so we was lovin’ for fall
But first we go together then break up, tears drip on her makeup
Fuck all night ‘til we wake up, and like George Gervin we lay up
Cuz all them lies I made up, it’s big checks no pay cut
Floor seats in Florida, Heat game vs Lakers
Shorty on my team now, it was us versus them haters
And everybody they talk bad, when they talk that she take up
She Hermes all flavors, young boy get paper
And all I know is go hard, and every time I touch that ball I go swish

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (don’t miss), I don’t miss (don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Sitting back with this paper falling in my lap
Feeling isolated, nothing but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you’re supposed to trust
Every night a different woman, fuck your money up
My bank account in shape, I could run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
Since I met her she can’t keep that pussy off me
On the pill, I’mma kill that pussy softly
Back to back, time to show you how a gangster move
Keys to the pad, talkin’ infinity pools
V12’s ain’t a thang, time to change your name
Paper stuffed in her purse can’t hear her phone ring

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (don’t miss), I don’t miss (don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

[Verse 3: Wale]
Homie, picture me rollin’, all them bitches be on me
They be fishing for compliments, I’m just fishing off Boca
Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals
So much over these hoes, should have been on a poster
Infatuated to say the least
He lay it weak, I lay you once you lay a week
Wale a freak, he know it doe, no go with hoes
When it come to showin’, I am working with totem pole
That’s head on head, she give me head, I give her glow
I’m in her body, I’m in her head like quote unquote
The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila
Au revoir to my rivals, double M genius shotta

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (don’t miss), I don’t miss (don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
From the night to the morn’, yeah she tryna lay
Got a freaky, freaky game and she tryna play
Couple more shots baby can you make it stay, stay up
Lay up, lay up
Might just slap the backboard, give you what you ask for
Lay up

[Verse 1]
Everybody sees this you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too

[Pre-Chorus]
So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes?
And where can love take us now?
We've been so far down

[Chorus]
We can still touch the sky if we crawl
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

[Verse 2]
Why did I change the pace?
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face (Your face)

[Pre-Chorus]
So where are you standing now?
Are you in the crowd of my faults? (My faults, oh)
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance

[Chorus]
We can still have it all so we'll crawl (If we crawl)
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

[Bridge]
Everybody sees this you
Well, I never wanna lose that view

[Chorus]
So we'll crawl (If we crawl) 'til we can walk again
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
So we'll crawl (If we crawl, oh) 'til we can walk again ('Til we can walk again)
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly (Yeah, yeah) until there is no wind
So let's crawl, let's crawl, let's crawl
Back to love
Like many Rastas, Bob Marley talks in a thick Jamaican Patois, which at times, is difficult to understand. He starts out talking about Reggae Music.

[Bob:]
Yeah, Jamaican people play it. It’s like… Musicians from Jamaica play that music, you know? Like Musicians from – you might find Black Musicians from America play the Funk or Blues, you know? People down here play Reggae Music.

[Interviewer:]
Can it be copied quite successfully outside of Jamaica?

Bob:
Well, you know, the way I feel about the music… It can be copied you know. But, it’s not copied direct... It’s the feel. You know? It carry a feel. If you ask plenty musicians… Them know it – but them can’t do it. So people still searching for this truth here, which this Reggae music you know, bring cross to them. And the only purpose it serve is to tell the people about Rastafari.

Interviewer:
Did you always intend being just a Reggae Musician or had you played Rock music and Soul music before?

[Bob Marley:]
In a sense. Me really used to listen to a lot of music, you know? I mean first time… Used to listen to music that play on the radio. We couldn’t afford to buy records so we listened to the Radio, and anything the radio play is that we hear. So I wasn’t really into them thing, I was really into like – they call it spiritual music. You know? ‘Cause it got me revolutionized. You know?

[Interviewer:]
How long have you been a Rasta?

[Bob Marley:]
Well I’ve been a Rasta from ever since. You know? But it’s not how long you’ve been a Rasta, it’s how long it take you to grow – because what you is – is what you is. From beginning to the end. You can never change, ‘cause if you even adopt things later – your own fate ah write out. So we ah just Rasta from creation, you know? It’s not an easy thing to explain. We’ve got educated standards and we still have people who can’t do it. But me ah common sense man, that mean when we explain things we explain it very, very simple way that me explain to a baby. The baby’ll understand too, you know? So we ah say now, like the Bible. The Bible say, God say he shall return as the King of King, the Lord of Lords, The Conqueror, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and him shall come in a new name. And his new name shall be dreadful among the heathen.

[Interviewer:]
How important are the Dreadlocks?

[Bob Marley:]
This? (pointing to the dreads) This is my identity man. Yeah this is my identity.

[Interviewer:]
Do you have to have dreadlocks if you are a Rasta?

[Bob Marley:]
Well if you Rasta then you wouldn’t say why you shouldn’t have it, because you know freedom is freedom and you don’t have to bow you do whatever you like. But it’s not a thing to say, “I wouldn’t like to be a Rasta because I wouldn’t like to have this” You dig? It can’t be a thing like that. That would be a foolish thing. You yourself know that it’s God create I and I don’t want no life no obligation. That means you’re your own man, that’s the first time you hold yourself. You do what you want to do. Anything people want to say about you - you don’t care because… you know what I mean? Even then we still have a comeback … (inaudible)

[Narrator:]
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Rastafarianism is the use of Marijuana as a central part of the philosophy. Officially named Ganja, it’s colloquially described by the Rastas as ‘herb,’ and Bob Marley is said to smoke a pound a week. It’s outlawed in Jamaica, and a convicted smoker can expect an 18 month jail sentence.

[Bob Marley:]
The more you accept herb is the more you accept Rastafari. You hear what me ah say? Me who accept herb… Herb is important, but herb is more important to the people who no accept it yet because that is the reality. I mean, we not selling them something that you crave but… It make sense and me say. Herb – Herb is a plant. I mean, Herb so good for everything. Why these people who want to do so much good for everyone, who call themselves government and this and that – why them say you must never use the herb? You see? And we take that and we can’t find... we just see them just say, ‘no you must not use it because it makes you rebel.’ Against what? Against men own crave, because them crave for the things like... say them have some material things and them want fi captivate your mind and tell you say, ‘well you have to work, and we’ll put you on pension,’ and them keep it all. So Herb make you look upon yourself and… Instead of you want to work for ‘Di Man’ you want fi be one of the Man too. Not in the sense of how him is, but in the sense that, ‘why should you have to bow to these things?’

[Interviewer:]
Do you have to smoke to be a Rasta?

[Bob Marley:]
No man. But – in this time, I mean like, how you stance… You reaching a sense where you strong enough, can take a little smoke (makes smoking animation) Sound of all them car a pass… although you live in a city you don’t hear it. Because you’re thinking. Your friend leave you just live so. You know, the whole world confuse you and you worried and you don’t have no time to think. Herb is a ting that give a little time to yourself so you can live. If you use it.

[Interviewer:]
What about Alcohol?

[Bob Marley:]
Alcohol make you drunk man. It don’t make you meditate it just make you drunk. When you drink alcohol you don’t meditate – you’re more giddy-headed. Herb is a consciousness.

[Interviewer:]
It must create problems for you though, when you go to different parts of the world, where perhaps it’s ‘outlawed’ as it were.

[Bob Marley:]
Well it’s just like what we are saying... It’s that I don’t care. You see the people who make it outlawed is but a few. Majority a people ‘pon the earth want it. It’s just a few, because guns and prisons and bad life treat you bad, so people kinda… But me want some people power… And the only people power is Rastafari.

[Narrator:]
Essentially, Marley’s a quiet man, a difficult man to reach because he’s got no interest in the hype vibe, which preoccupies so many rock stars. He upset many New Zealand interviewers by refusing interviews. Not because of a sudden whim, but because really, he isn’t interested in that type of thing.

[Bob Marley:]
Media. If I were in the Newspaper, I would do a lot of interviews, because what I want to say I would get it across. But when you talk to someone, you have to go to someone, and it must be healthy for their business. And if it too militant, them try fi spread a type of propaganda. You know the media (laughs) … Control.

[Interviewer:]
You were badly hurt once because of what seemed to be some political-type shooting in your home country, Jamaica. Do you see dabbling in Politics a good idea for someone in your position?

[Bob Marley:]
Well… You say dabble in Politics? I don’t know what that is. You say stand up and talk fi my rights? I know that that is. See? And I don’t care who the guy is… because my right is my right. Like my life. You know? All I have is my life. That means that I can say I don’t want that or I don’t want this. When I check it out, the biggest man was a baby one time, so I don’t know when 

[they] get all of these big ideas, want to be ruler, want people, and help enforce ‘devilism.’ Can’t dig it. Can’t take it. Me a rebel man. Me a revolutionist.

[Interviewer:]
Is that the way you see yourself?

[Bob Marley:]
Yeah me see myself as a revolutionary, who don’t have no help. And nah take no bribe from no one, meh fight it single-handed. The music. Rasta is the future. See? (laughs) Rasta is the future escape.

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch y' honey drip, can't keep away

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head

[Break]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Bridge]
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now

[Verse 3]
Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

[Break]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old yellow bricks, love's a risk
Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed when you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Verse 2]
She was enraged by the way
That the emperor were trapped in the cage
And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles
You're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Verse 3]
You're at a loss just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from
She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia"
I know I said, "Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?"
But Dorothy was right though

[Verse 1]
There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
And there are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say

[Chorus]
Like I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (To put)
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

[Bridge]
Valerie (Oh, Valerie)
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies)
Valerie (Oh, Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No, you just don’t know what I do, what I do, oh, Valerie)
Valerie
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I know)
Valerie (I know, Valerie)
You'd rather this than be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true
'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

[Outro]
And I love you
('Cause I love you baby)
And I need you
(When I need, need)
I only want you
And nobody gonna know...

[Verse 1]
I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I'll just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

[Pre-Hook]
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

[Hook]
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

[Verse 2]
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
I’ll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won’t stop until you ask me
Don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets

[Pre-Hook]
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
And know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

[Hook]
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

[Bridge]
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine

[Hook]
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

[Verse 1]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate (Oh no)

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 2]
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 3]
Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong

[Chorus]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Intro]
So this is the end of the story

[Verse]
Start selling weed for my brother, the age was eleven
Thirty off a hundred dollars he working the shipments
Seventh grade Christmas time, momma gave me a fifty
I spent that fifty with the dope man, he gave me two fifties
I owed a fifty but I trapped and I paid him so quickly
I had them dimes so big junkies callin' me biggie
I moved out, paying rent was such a good feeling
I hit a lick, thirty grand fell out of the ceiling
I’m in Savannah and my nigga like king of the city
In Alabama with them hammers they plotting to get me
These suckers tried to take my life on a couple occasions
Been grinding hard, thirty years, never took a vacation
And ever since seventeen, been stuck on probation
I chased a nigga, stabbed his ass now they calling me Jason
I fell out with my homeboy, I swear it was crazy
And we don't really know each other, but having a baby
I travelled all around the world been plenty of places
I'm Gucci, trashbag cash got plenty of faces
In Sun Valley, trapping hard like back in the Eighties
I leave with eighty, spend at least thirty grand in the station
I lost my nigga Dunk and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest
I lost my nigga Dunkin and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest

[Outro]
So this is the end of the story

[Intro]
Remember, remember, remember
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Remember my first day at school, my moms made it cool
She has me lookin' real fresh with the latest shoes
I had the Nike tie and the datin' suit
So you ain't gotta guess who it's dedicated to
Mama, you the one I need
Ain't another woman that's as beautiful as she
Said if it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song
To say hey, hope you know what I'm doin'
I hope that you can hear me from over the moon
And, I'm thinkin' back back, do you remember that that?
I said, "Hey, mom, they hating on my backpack"
So you went to Wal-Mart and copped me some new shit
The bag that all the kids would drool if I went to school in
I said if it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song, to say hey

[Chorus]
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama

[Verse 2]
Remember my first trainin' wheels, my moms paid the bill
Real happy all the time, how she made me feel
And we ain't never been rich but she paid the bill
And anythin' I ever wanted she could make it real
Mama kept it so real
It's us against the world ,then we tell them, "Oh well"
I be like, "Oh, hell nah, you talk about my Mom?
It's about to be on in the schoolyard"
I gotta thank my mom for all the things she did
Sittin', reminiscin' on the things you said
If it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song, to say hey

[Hook]
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama

[Bridge]
Aw, man, ma, I wish you could see me right now
I'm doin' such great things, I love you
Rest in piece, Luella Peterson
You'll always stay in my heart, Mom
This one's for my mom
I wish that I could see you once more
Just one more time
I miss you so, so much
So, so, so much
So, so, so
So, so

[Chorus]
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama

[Verse 1]
They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

[Verse 2]
They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

[Verse 3]
A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

[Verse 4]
He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

[Verse 5]
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

[Verse 6]
People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate

[Verse 1]
Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

[Verse 2]
Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

[Verse 3]
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

[Verse 4]
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way

[Verse 5]
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the sum-time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mi-mink boots in the winter time like Will.I.Am

[Hook]
Let me know if you feel it man
I just messed up on my rap, live TV like damn
But hey, hey here we again yeah
He-here we go again
People talking this but when this hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me
Now break it down

[Verse 2]
Yo, off the top of the dome, dome
Shout out to Chi-town where I call home
Coast to coast, LA to New York to London to Paris
Shout out to Barry
That's my security guard
Cause my rhymes is hard
Listen up I got to praise god
For the number one spot that I got cause I'm hot
And everything I am cause of everything I was not
Cause I never was shot
They said I'd never make raps to hit the block
Or never sold a crack rock
But now everybody on the jock
And I got the game lock
Everybody bring it back
With the rap I don't know how to act I go crazy
Backstage, Beyoncé and Jay-Z
And LeBron and I'm gone
I'm the don, number one
Keep going going on
Got to keep it going on
I keep goin' goin' goin' yeah
I keep flowin' flowin' flowin'
Yo, I meant to freestyle, I meant to mess up
Y'all meant to dress up
Ay yo, I'm fresh up
Who fresher than Mr. West uh
No-no-no-no-nobody I'm talking all y'all right now
The blogs, the blogs
Yo, they try to dis me
But they can not see I'm on Saturday Night getting busy
Y'all wish ya can be me, hey mama can you see me?
Hey daddy can you see me?
I'm rocking on your TV
Y'all thought they'd never let me back in NBC, see?
La La La Laaaa

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you ain't ruling shit
I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up
Sun down, or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mama
With no condom
That's good pussy, pussy
Tell it to your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms
Man look, your man look like sweet water
Cornbread that break under pressure when he's caught up
They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a young boss in the batcave
Back against the wall
I came back with them back pains

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell 'em put my name on a gym ball
Like I'm Derrick Rose
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
I'm spiking your game towel
And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas
I make your weight shape thin
Blank tapes in your deck
You can still break they necks
They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to spend
Club appearance go for twenty-five racks
When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin
So Lord forgive me yes I'm a sinner
But these hoes is with me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coached fools to protools to make my agenda
I'm tofu, Im nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker would
Get your whole career injured
Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Favorite rapper last record
I fucked your favorite actress on the matress
What a blessing
Make that pussy ante up
She call my dick antidepressant
I'm really not impressed with
None of you niggas stressing
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence
Picking popping
I'm popping big shit with label investments
Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session
Came up with shit, writer's block
Niggas up in this dressing like
"Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?"
Even when you Slumdog, you'll still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer
Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer
Church to you pussies
You push me, get pap smeered
Burst out your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks
And bitches rubbing on they tits
Until they fingers monkey wrenched
Monkey see what monkey do
You monkeys never make no sense
Jump up a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No hastle when breaking your picket fence
Know pterodactyls that still exist
And clap you if you resist
Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate
And you at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can taste it from planet Pluto
Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle
Rip out your culo, then kudos
Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more
Cause I 

[???]
Wipe it off on my shoe, ho
Before you 

[???] your Menthol
Meant to get smoked then sent off
To Jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means ain't no hood
Hopping California JACO
Watching Snoop's latest prince get down
Bitch, start popping fireworks
K. Dot

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I can't get no sleep I've got these money habits
Every time I see some money, you know I've gotta grab it
Dopeboy I do magic with saran wrapper
Done seen more bricks than a contractor
And you can't bring it back if you done bust a wrapper
My daughter 4 months, bricks in her pamper
I'm a road master, I love Tampa
You say you from the streets, then I gotta stamp ya
Grant, Jackson, Ben Franklin
If money through with you then you ain't gonna make it
The streets will give it to you and the streets will take it
Every nigga in the streets got no patience

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money, yeah, I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreaming seeing money, talking Ben Franklins
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking Ben Franklins

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I go loco 'bout that guapo, off El Chapo with the choppa
Like a rasta I will've shot ya, blocka blocka Waka Flocka!
I got young niggas in the hood that'll kill your ass for 50 dollars
Holla red rock if you scared, nigga I ain't never hollered
Don't be bothered I strapped the C4 right to you father
Pipe Bomb taped to a toddler
No I'm not an infant but I got a bunch of baby bottles
For instance, I back doored a nigga in The Ramada
The distance from Florida to Georgia is farther
My amigos is still sending bales across the border
Off the boat bitch I swear she look like she came out the water
It's BrickSquad 1017 and ain't no niggas harder!

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money, yeah, I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreaming seeing money, talking Ben Franklins
I got money habits, I got money habits
Every time I see some money yeah I gotta grab it
I got money habits, I got money habits
Daydreamer seeing money, talking Ben Franklins

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

Yous a Nicky Barnes ass nigga tryin to tell on Guy Fisher

Pots, forks: dope at a high cost
From coast to coast, I said numbers on the dope

Prices lower then Shawty Lo, when I drive
Got my seat leanin low bricks inside

[Verse 3: Trae the Truth]
What  the fuck was you thinking the bitch you must have been drinking

If I let it ride you’re bound to be stinkin
I’m an asshole I do what I’d like too
On shit thats made for you to fight to
I don’t give a fuck bitch I don’t like you
Got that fire bitch I might light you
Bitch I am the streets you just look tough
Call the bricks snow like I was on bluff
Call me the master like Sho'Nuff
Bad boy the forreal no puff
If a nigga pussy I don’t pimp mine
I just keep the distance don’t play with mine
Stay in your place fall out the line
Had the young niggas over here to pay a fine
You can find me in the hood what a hood don’t go
Heard that somebody the hood don’t know
If a nigga turn up tellem watch this show
Money never sit still so my net don’t blow
King of the streets just call me sire
All my throne they no one higher
T-R-U-T-H no liar
Real street nigga I won’t retire

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Yous a dead man, playing games with the bread
Yous a dead man, I put that pistol to your head man
Dead man you’re playing games with my bread
You in the red man, fuck around and be a dead man
Dead man, dead man, yous a dead man
Dead man, dead man, yous a dead man
Dead man, I put that pistol to your head man
Dead man, I put that pistol to your head man, dead man

[Verse 1]
Lights, camera, acción
If he likes me, takes me home
Lights, camera, acción
If he likes me, takes me home
Lights, camera, acción
If he likes me, takes me home

[Chorus]
Come on, you know you like little girls
Come on, you know you like little girls
You can be my daddy
You can be my daddy

[Verse 2]
Lights, camera, acción
He didn't know he'd have this much fun
Lights, camera, acción
He didn't know he'd have this much fun
Lights, camera, acción
He didn't know he'd have this much fun

[Chorus]
Come on, you know you like little girls
Come on, you know you like little girls
You can be my daddy

[Bridge]
"You're my little sparkle jump-rope queen
You're my little sparkle
You're my little sparkle jump-rope queen
You're my little sparkle"

[Verse 3]
Lights, camera, acción
You know I can't make it on my own

[Chorus]
Put me in a movie (Put me in a movie)
(Come on, you know you like little girls)
Put me in a movie
(Come on, you know you like)
You can be my daddy
You can be my daddy
Put me in a movie
You can be my daddy
George Carlin was one of the smartest men I've ever heard
Challenged you through his comedy and displayed the power of words
My brother Dave Chappelle is a genius through his show you saw the proof
Wittily exposed the lies and had us laughing at the truth
Foxworthy, Katt, Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory was the king
But from your shows it must be told I never learned a fucking thing
Eddie Griffin through his riffin' appeals to a higher sense of purpose
Takes our darkest deepest ignorances and pulls them to the surface
Turns them into food for thought, it's funny but you thinking
A comics power is they use the fun to overcome forgive me if I'm reaching
They always spoke the truth to power in a disguised and friendly bit
Only a comic can diss a president and even have him laughing at the shit
What happened to that? Strong social critiques thru thoughtful comedic jabs?
But you'd rather do "yo mama" jokes cause some heckler got you mad
I hate to break the news, but I love that it will be spoke
You didn't take your comedy seriously, so now YOU are the fucking joke!

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
One, two, one, two, one two
Mm
One, two, one, two, one two
One, two
Turn the headphones up, Ali
One, two
You mix with Dre, right?
Hehehehehe
Turn the headphones up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God: "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year been quite similar to a Lear
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered a G5
G's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere
The presence of being real"
As I lay in this four-corner room, staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act-right
Tryna smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
"It's Dark and Plus Hell is Hot"—that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
That's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision: Ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch
We eating off each other tray, the dollar-menu amount
Meanwhile, the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort
But I ain't need it
I never screamed out "The New West," I didn't believe it
They brung each other down, I was planning out my achievements, huh
I need to separate myself to stand out, huh
I need a better way to take your fans now, huh
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead (Doot doot doot)
Three hollow-tips aimed at your head (Doot doot doot)
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now (Doot doot doot doot)
And we never asked for no handout
In the midst of it, all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in the Hall of Fame
And I went to trial with a Bible and rifle
I play the game as I "blam-blaow!"
Holler back at me, nigga
And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that you make it or live your life in the Matrix
'Cause falling off is a sickness—I heard that it's quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out, huh
I need a better way to take your fans now, huh
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow-tips aimed at your head

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never ask for no handouts
I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now (Soul!)
In the midst of it all, was cooking, them pots and pans out
Looking forward as four of us forced to form a new clan now
Fast-forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor, with work in a Jansport

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play
And there goes my fate; now, I'm on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in hot pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even wreck it with Gaga, too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I 'posed to do? Rock!

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated when Warner had let me loose
I was honored—see, they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinking 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong and right that I prolong
The story, the short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that don't recover when babies killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question:
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?

[Intro]
Usher, Usher
Yeah, man
True story
Real G's with me on this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Wifey home, wedding band, I'm a lucky man
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night, I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie (oh)
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life
Man, I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

[Verse 2]
I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates
With weather in Atlanta, all outgoing flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way
We started talking business, she handed me a card
We exchanged information, I rented me a car
While I'm driving, she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts
Fine as hell, but I don't wanna break my baby's heart, no, no

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

[Verse 3]
They call me U-S, H-E-R, R-A, Y-M, O-N-D
And I just wanna do right by my lady
But lately, I been slipping up
Fantasies 'bout dimes on the side, dark tint on my ride
I got a 10 in my ride, I can hide, I can't lie, lie
But ever since I put that band on my hand
More and more chicks trying to get at me than I know what to do
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose
Break her heart, I do want to do
I don't want to be that fool, make that move
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules
Bend a bit but never break the rules

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

[Outro]
She got the door locked and the lock don't fit your key
Yeah, you punching up her numbers in the ADT
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me
Better not feed, feed, feed that appetite
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB
And some other brother been tossing up your PYT
Get caught slipping you gon' wish you would've listened to me
Brother, don't feed, feed, feed that appetite

[Outro]
Usher, Usher

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Meek Mill]
Gucci
Meek Milly
From ATL to Philly, nigga
Real recognize real
Yeah, we hood rich bitch
Trap God, turn us up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a money getting nigga
At least, that's just what I'm known for
You better call on my connect
And ask him what he put me on for
I heard y'all niggas ballin'
Then why the fuck you take a loan for?
Better get the fuck out East Atlanta
You niggas know you don't belong there
All my niggas smoking strong here
We don't talk reckless on the phone here
A lot of cliques don't get along here
Bricksquad my nig, we rock our own gear (Squad)
I'm on the grass, sitting on the lawn chair
I hope that you don't read me wrong
But if I go pull out that tone there
I bet that you don't make it home
I'm in the trap house with my long johns
And I been trapping all day long (Skrt!)
They call me Baking Soda Armstrong
Before it dry, that shit be gone

[Chorus: Gucci Mane and Meek Mill]
I'm a money getting nigga
(Money getting nigga)
At least, that's just what I'm known for

(You better stay up out of Philly, nigga
You know you pussies don't belong here)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Rose gold on my bottom six
Half a mill on foreign whips
I'm in the wheel with a foreign bitch
I'm on the bra strap, and she on this dick
Just bow down, you lame
Your diamonds look strange
I'm grinding like Wayne
When he on that skateboard, I'm saying
Nigga your new girl's my old bitch
My old bitch your new girl
Young lil rich Philly nigga
Them hoes tell me I'm too thorough
I don't even fuck one on one
Cause when I come, I need two girls
That's down to fuck like all night
Give them bitches that hard pipe
Riding with with a ho named Keisha
And we smoking on Keisha
Young nigga fresh like Easter
Blood dripping on my sneakers
Straight drop, I stick that
I sell a brick, I get back
That Molly look like a Tic Tac
And I tell that ho that I get it back like 'Whoa'

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Meek Mill]
I'm a money getting nigga
(Money getting nigga)
At least, that's just what I'm known for
(That's just what I'm known for)
You better call up my connect
(My connect)
And ask him what he put me on for
(What he put me on for)
I heard y'all niggas ballin'
(Ballin)
Then why the fuck you take a loan for?
(Loan for)
(You better stay up out of Philly, nigga
You know you pussies don't belong here)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I drop a bag on your head, nigga
And they'll locate your ass like OnStar
I ain't have to buy shit, nigga
My nigga Waka got his own car
You on my dick like you a bitch, nigga
Why don't you go and quote your own bars?
And I don't want to go back to jail, nigga
But you gon' make me catch one more charge
I could look and tell you're frail nigga
But you keep on tryin' to look hard
Your friends keep asking "What's the smell, nigga?"
That's your motherfucking homeboys

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Meek Mill]
I'm a money getting nigga
(Money getting nigga)
At least, that's just what I'm known for
(That's just what I'm known for)
You better call up my connect
(My connect)
And ask him what he put me on for
(What he put me on for)
I heard y'all niggas ballin'
(Ballin)
Then why the fuck you take a loan for?
(Loan for)
(You better stay up out of Philly, nigga
You know you pussies don't belong here)

[Verse 1]

Ok, now fresh pair of J's on my feet
That's how I do it
If you scuff my J's then we gon' have to get into it
Stuff you with my right
And then I'll deck you with my other hand
And you might get a little hit
But I'll bounce back just like a rubberband BOW
All up in your motherfucking face
I'll bust your bottom lip, come get a motherfucking taste
These BG's see me on tv
And better not mistake me for no sucker (sucker)
Cuz' the .44 make em hit the flo'
Flowin semiautomatic make 'em run for cover, cover, cover
Cover your eyes and cover your mouth
When a grown man talkin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
Matter fact that's how I'm walkin'
Walking it out
But on the other hand I'm walking it in
When it comes to the pa-pa-paper
Drink Conjure straight
That means no cha-cha-cha-cha-chaser
Thats right conjure-conjure-conjure
No I don't drink no more vodka
So find me gettin slizzard
At the bar with Waka Flocka
Managed by Zulu, Chaka
Can't touch me like Osama
Other rappers need to cover their face up like Lady Gaga

[Intro: Lil' Scrappy]
I was on the ave' cuttin slabs with my patna' dem
Then I left the block and hit the lab with my patna' dem
Flipped a couple bad little bitches with my patna' dem
Beat a fuck nigga, get some stitches for my patna' dem
Ciroc, this my fucka' I'm a sip it with my patna' dem
Roll a couple of swishers, hit the blunt with my patna' dem
Fresh up on the scene looking clean with my patna' dem
Got a bag of kush and some beans from my patna' dem
Got a bad bitch super cool with my patna' dem
Hit up south side, rich too with my patna' dem
Need a couple dollar, I'm a holla at my patna' dem
Nigga wanna problem, scrap them squabble with it patna' dem

[Hook: Rich Kids]
Boulevard (My patna' dem)
Herndon Holmes (My patna' dem)

You know Pittsburgh (My patna' dem--patna' dem with patna' dem)
You know I fuck with (patna' dem)

Adamsville (My patna' dem)
Bowen Homes (My patna' dem)

[Ludacris]
Ludacris (My patna' dem)
D-D-DTP (My patna' dem)

[Rich Kids]
Ayyyyyyyyyy
This is how I kicks it

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
College park my patna' dem
Benjamins, I got lots of them
Come and try to take my Benjamins and see big Glocks and me cocking them
Platinum hits, I'm dropping them
Louie kicks, I'm rocking them
So zip your lips it Ludacris and bitch it ain't no stopping them
Silly hoes, I'm socking them
Fifteens in the trunk, I'm knocking them
Why the 5 percent tint on this Bentley window always blocking them?
Cause Lil' Scrappy my patna' dem
Tity Boi, I'm on the block with him
Dolla Boy he be robbing them and Lil' Fate I ride in the drop with him
I-Dub, we be swapping them
Get a couple of bills and popping them
Ching-a-ling was DTP but we had to end up dropping him
Now B.X.C., my patna' dem
Willy and P what's popping Slim?
DTP still going strong and all these hoes be jocking them
Doing them and bopping them
Screwing them, chop-chopping them
Notorious like B.I.G. and he even got a little bit of Pac in him
Now new artists, we shopping them
Air ones, we stocking them
Hit the dealership, get a brand new whip and then we hop in them
Bad boy like Block and them
It's going down like Joc and them
Chaka Zulu and Jeff Dixon, I'm going all the way to the top with them
Business deals, we locking them
Forbes list, we topping them
And Conjure cognac is coming soon, no diss to Ciroc and them
Ohhhhh

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
Delia, oh, Delia
Delia all my life
If I hadn'ta shot poor Delia
I'da had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone

First time I shot her
Shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot, she died
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone

Well, the guilty get a sentence
But I ain't gonna tell you mine
'Cause I got a brother in Memphis
Doin' life or ninety-nine
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone

But jailer, oh, jailer
Jailer, I can't sleep
'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone
Now you give me my hammer
I'll drag the ball and chain
And every rock I bust
I seem to ring out Delia's name
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone
Delia's gone, one more round, Delia's gone

Oh, Delia
Delia's gone like a July snow
Delia's gone

[Verse 1]
Delia, oh Delia
Delia all my life
If I hadn't of shot poor Delia
I'd have had her for my wife

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Verse 2]
I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there
Found her in her parlor
And I tied her to her chair

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Verse 3]
She was low-down and trifling
She was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me
Want to grab my sub-machine

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Verse 4]
First time I shot her
Shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Verse 5]
But jailer, oh, jailer
Jailer, I can't sleep
Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Verse 6]
So if your woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Chorus]
Delia's gone
One more round
Delia's gone

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Verse 1]
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

[Verse 2]
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with "Goodbye"
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile

[Verse 1]
Arnold Layne
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine

[Verse 2]
On the wall
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it

[Chorus]
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne

[Verse 3]
Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang
He hates it

[Chorus]
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne, don't do it again

[Verse 1]
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the Top 100 list

[Chorus]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

[Post-Chorus]
She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means

[Verse 2]
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says that "We are defenders of any poser
Or professional pretender around"

[Chorus]
And when did your list replace the twist and turn
Like a fist replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

[Bridge]
Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker

[Outro]
Presuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?

[Verse 1]
Running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

[Verse 2]
Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait

[Chorus]
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Well, you'll be able to boast
Of the day of the most flawless heist of all time

[Outro]
You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather keep on the balaclava

[Verse 1]
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

[Verse 2]
There's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways

[Chorus]
And we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes
Forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes

[Bridge]
The more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important
(Give me obnoxious, give me obnoxious now)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

[Verse 3]
Wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the kiln
And we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

[Verse 4]
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck (We're forever unfulfilled)
We tend to see that as a perk, though (Can't think why)
Look what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend (Like a search for murder clues)
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 1]
Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore
See, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure

[Chorus]
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

[Verse 2]
Oh, a sudden disheartener
Somebody's partner's talking to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew, how could she not? She could have anyone she wants
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response
Like, "I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine"
I said, "Really, love, it's fine"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
She said, "It's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse

[Verse 1]
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

[Chorus]
And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own

[Verse 2]
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

[Chorus]
And even if somehow they could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know

[Verse 1]
He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert was seeking an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

[Chorus]
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

[Verse 2]
'D' is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
On the brink of an episode

[Bridge]
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel—I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

[Chorus]
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......

Oooh, don't talk to me
Please, just fuck with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
Ice cream, taste good if you eat it soon

Oooh, don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very, very, very frail
Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......

[Hook:]
Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

[Biggie]
I'm sticking ice picks on the tip of your dick
Give your testicles a swift kick ain't that some shit
Am I hard-hardcore harder than the Plymouth
It ain't no myth. It's a nigga with a spliff
And a chrome four-fifth pressed on yo back
So what you want nigga?
How you wanna act?
I'm uncivilized cause I love to see niggas die
Brains all leaking out on the street
And the pastor preaching: he was a good man
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singing sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis
You fuck with the high die you die
You're the same motherfucker
If you look up in the sky
I want some old nex shit
Suplex shit
Hardcore sex shit

[Hook:]
Grab the 9, 2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

[Biggie]
A repetitive loop all I need to display
Solo is the proof I put it to you boy
Hope you got the scoop
Biggie Smalls the rap genius
I keep the Glock by the penis
The cleanest cut fuck sluts
With the big humongous butts
I used to rub a butt
My style is Gucci like the hookers pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk
To push me into flamin 'em
Like that little nigga Damien
Glock 19 to my motherfucking cranium
Gang-thight gun toting motherfucker
Niggas in they brains thought biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em, I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggas dont want the friction
Told you before how I bring the drama
Slaying Larry Johnson and his grand mama!

[Hook:]
Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets,a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run,so I grab my gun!

[Biggie]
Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga when I get busy, throw ya hands in the sky nigga I got the illest of the ill mentality
Niggas be grabbing me, knowing that they rather be stabbing me
All up in my back, try'na  take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front throw a gat to the fool next one to move is getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release Master piece it's like indecent
Stuck to your ass like tissue when you're wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believin'
I'm marked with death hard to kill like Steven
With Jacob I'm leavin' the black man's motto: "You got a better chance playing lotto"

[Hook:]
Grab the 9,2 clips and run a muck!
So I grab my gun
A fist-full of bullets, a chest full of teflon
Nowhere to run, so I grab my gun!

[Verse 1]
All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

[Chorus 1]
Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

[Verse 2]
All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

[Chorus 2]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love]
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love]
If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love]
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love]
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet cause I'm so embarassed
Oh, yeah

[Outro: Brian Wilson]
I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table

[Intro]
Greeting boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P (My name is Petey P)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (That’s right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (And sing)
Your pop guns and fireworks (And sing)
And sing along (Along)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Sing along kids, sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

[Verse 1]
Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah

[Bridge]
And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)

[Verse 2]
Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
That's crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Round

Sugar and spice, everything nice

Say so, stay-o, I'll give you somethin' to pray for

Long hair, pinned up

Hope desire's in your thoughts
Thinking of you, dreaming of us

[Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!
Maybach Music

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo!

I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on, to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessey and for my niggas
OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job
Boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks
Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh
If I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I’m forever living

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre]
Women, weed, and weather
They come for women, weed, and weather
For the women, weed, and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed, and weather
Got that women, weed, and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got the recipe
Fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)
Everybody know I got that Yola
Ask Keisha she'll confess
I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on no makeup, uh
Medicated, please my nigga no telling where the high gonna take us, uh
Three w's, I'm at the W, She got double D's bout to bring trouble through
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet, I'm trying to dive in the swimming pool
Left stroke, right stroke, whats the best stroke
That stroke can smoke all down her throat
And we blows all kinds of dro
Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Playas always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table my nigga
Get you a table my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, Ok lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Verse 2: Ab Soul]
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soulo)
Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock

I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
So it's that groovy little nigga
Known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick
Bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh
Have that pussy throbbing
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that
Twisting off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose
Can I get a shot, swim in your juice
Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet
Bitch did you see your tab receipt?

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
(Sherane)
Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
More, more, bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One, then multiplies 'til you can taste the sun
And burned by the sky you try to take it from
But if it falls, there's no place to run
Crumbling down, it's so unreal
They're dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again, to places you've been
And bending your will 'til it breaks you, within
And still, they fill their eyes
With the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad with the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness, but I know that I've tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I've looked down the line
And what's there is not what ought to be
Held back by the battles they fought for me
Calling me to be part of their property
And now, I see that I get no chance
I get no break
Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And as the tightrope within slowly starts to thin
I can only hope that they close their eyes
To the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad to the way I feel
Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness, but I know that I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Verse 1]
I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realise I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

[Verse 2]
The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real, it feels

[Chorus]
It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

Show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I’m dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin’ good
Wanna show you how much, how much you’re understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you’re patient with me bay
Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you’re through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Loving you is really all that’s on my mind
And I can’t help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

[Hook: Beyonce]
Tonight I’m gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I’m gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I’m gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Swirlin’ on you babe swirlin’ swirlin on you babe
Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody cuz

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
You’ll never need 2, cuz I will be your number 1
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I’m the one
That’s why I’m all into you
Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That’s why I’m backin’ this thing back
Pop poppin’ this thing back
Drop drop drop dropping this thing back
This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won’t never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don’t thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it’s the pre game show
Daddy you know what’s up

[Bridge: Beyonce]

[Hook: Beyonce]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey Shawty show me that you love the way, that I do
Whatever, to show the world I’m crazy bout you
I tell them everything amazing bout you
The reason behind me saying I do
It’s hidden in the way you toot it in the air and drop it down
And give it to me dirty when nobody ain’t around
Your legs in the air and your clothes on the ground
And your head in the pillow, trying to hold in the sound
Now come here Shawty, let me grab and hold that
Remote control that, I love to rock when you you there for me
I want you to know that, when you undressing
It’s like I’m living out a fantasy
Cause you so soft, and I’m not that
You want this, well you got that
Magnum lifestyle, know I’m bout that
That Bentley, lay you on top that
Knock that ass from here to tomorrow
On the balcony, out in Cabo
Know a shopping spree will follow
I’m in love, watching you model
Couple candle lights, create the ambiance
And yo lingerie and yo Louis Vuitton
Pussy sick and slow music on
And I’m watching you like it’s a movie yo

[Verse 1]
Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving .44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

[Verse 2]
Laid in the hot joints, taking the pills
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
"Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more"

[Verse 3]
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff coming down the line
Hocked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, "Come on you dirty hack into that district court"

[Verse 4]
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little Judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read, "In the first degree..."
I hollered, "Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me"
The Judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down

[Outro]
Come all, you've got to listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey, and let that cocaine be

[Spoken Word]
"These men have receptions
Matlock A50632, and Batshelter 83979
They have receptions"
Yeah, I doubt that

[Trey Songz]

Beast and I rhyme part time on them
Pour champagne and wine on them

[Hook: Big Sean]
Oh God
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
She said she gon' have it
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
Aww shit there go our little secret

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
It was all good just a week ago
Worst problem that I had was that my speakers blown
In my whip, fuck it I got me a job
I feel rich I ain't gotta sell weed I'm legit
Shit I seen her pull up in a parking lot first
Thought I had was hotties, hoes didn't find where I work
Then her friend, "Hey go girl go tell 'em"
I knew she was mad as hell when that bitch said, "Tell em'"
All because I hit and stop textin'
But before I finish that thought she told me she pregnant (The fuck?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
She like I ain't try to argue with it, I know you got bitches
I just hit you back because I'm moving forward with this shit
Really my mom and my aunt was my father figures
I just figured with fathers it might make all the difference
I'm sayin', "Is it mine? Do we gotta get Maury involved with it?"
"How many niggas you think that I done had all in it? Stupid nigga"
I don't even know why I'm sayin shit
I hate to be on that all-nigga's-the-same shit
But shit I'm saying girl it is what it is
We talking kids with a kid and a crib with a crib
But I ain't tryin' to leave believe
I would be a good dad just like my dad was to me
And I can't tell you to kill that shit my mom had me
And I can't tell you to keep a shit we ain't ready
Now I gotta tell my family to pull up a seat
Cause I planted a seed and about to extend the family tree
And we so stressed out that I called a weed man
Cause I prolly gotta bout a whole family tree

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean (Common)]
Granny called my mom sayin' I have demons
I heard my parents talkin' in the next bed
(To raise Sean we damn near had to give a left leg
What the hell they teachin' these kids in sex ed?)
Everything that I forgot while getting the best head
I know couples who took classes cause they couldn't
I know ball players who pay strippers so they wouldn't
What really make me feel like I ain't shit
Is that I still gotta tell my main chick

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fuck, there go our little secret
She gon' have it
She gon' keep it
9 months later shit we gon' see it
Damn, aww shit

[Intro]
Uh! Ya too rude!
Uh! Eh! OH What a rat race!
Oh, what a rat race!
Oh, what a rat race!
Oh, what a rat race!
This is the rat race! Rat race! (Rat race!)

Some a lawful, some a bastard, some a jacket
Oh, what a rat race, yeah! Rat race!

[Verse 1]
Some a gorgon-a, some a hooligan-a, some a guine-gog-a
In this sphere rat race, yeah!
Rat race!
I'm singing that
When the cat's away
The mice will play
Political violence fill ya city, ye-ah!
Don't involve Rasta in your say say
Rasta don't work for no C.I.A
Rat race, rat race, rat race! Rat race, I'm saying
When you think is peace and safety
A sudden destruction
Collective security for surety, ye-ah!

[Verse 2]
Don't forget your history
Know your destiny
In the abundance of water
The fool is thirsty
Rat race, rat race, rat race!

[Verse 3]
Rat race!
Oh, it's a disgrace
To see the human-race
In a rat race, rat race!
You got the horse race
You got the dog race
You got the human-race
But this is a rat race, rat race!

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'd sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers
I try to do good, even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart
But my blood's filled with demons, I'm fighting myself, hah
Believe me, I'm far from lingering, far from ready
If you knew where I come from, knew what I've been through
You'd think there should have been another outcome
Just like most kids, a father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they'll X you like Malcolm
Then you wonder how come
I can move in a room full of wolves so swift, so smooth
Thank you, Mom, for making me a man
Let a motherfucker knock down my castle out of sand

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe (To believe) in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand
Reach for my hand

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
(Woo!)
I lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking for the keys, but they won't find 'em
I come from struggle, I'm a fighter, must she be reminded?
My mother's past has her trapped, has her blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future
Mom, I love you, I salute ya
And no matter what happens, just know you're the reason that I'm rappin'

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe (To believe) in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand
Reach for my hand

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
Look..
I'm from the home of the spinners, the winners, The Big Apple
Came down at South Beach to build a new castle
Every day I'm hustelin' and every day you hassle
Doin' what you can and I'm doin' what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and I'ma show you I'm a winna
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show em' the big picture
Pit, hit the switch, I promise I'll never switch up
This is for my brother, two, three who went to jail
I'm sending all the pictures of my shows through the mail
He hit me with a letter, said, "I knew you'd never fail"
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe (To believe) in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand
Reach for my hand

[Intro: Big Sean]
God, oh, God
Boi, boi
I've been workin' all god damn year, I just got my check
I'm 'bout to spend it all on me, I'm worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now (Yeah)
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Haan?)
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Yeah)
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now (Big Sean)
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, I need 50k large (Right now)

So I be goin' so hard (Right now)
Detroit is my yard (Right now)
I need a 17 car garage (Right now)
I need a 17 broad menage (Right now)
I need a jail house to free my dogs (Right now)
I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life
So I'ma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
"Control yo' hoes, you let her talk 'til you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!"
I'm on

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Oh God)
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now (Oh God, boi, boi, boi)
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I need 50k large (Right now)
My homie just beat the charge (Right now)
My brother need a new job (Right now)
So I be goin' so hard (Right now)
I need my face on a black card (Right now)
My iPhone need a charge (Right now)
My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (Right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now (D-Town)
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Outro]
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah
Right now, woah, woah
Four, three, two, one
This to all my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, won't stop right now
Four, three, two, one
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, won't stop right now
Hell nah, won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now
Four, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
You wanna make me sick, you wanna lick my wounds, don't you, baby?
You want the badge of honour when you save my hide
But you're the one in the way of the day of doom, baby
If you need my shame to reclaim your pride

[Chorus]
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry, get off now, baby
It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands

[Verse 2]
You feed the beast I have within me
You wave the red flag, baby, you make it run, run, run
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning
You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun

[Chorus]
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry, get off now, baby
It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands

[Chorus]
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists
I never did anything to you, man
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies
So call me crazy, hold me down
Make me cry, get off now, baby
It won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So back, I'm so bad, I'm so bad

[Verse 1]
Can I be honest with you, please?
It's really hard for me to speak right now
Girl, I been drinkin' all day
It's been a long week, can't you tell by my face?
I wanna lose myself between your legs
I wanna make your body shake
Girl, if you drink this fifth, no chase
I promise you'll have nothing to say, nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be

[Chorus]
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word
And I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to get you high without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
And I'm just trying to let you leave without a word

[Post-Chorus]
Please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, get what I want this time
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I forgot what it feels to regret my sins
I need that old thing back lately
You can help me out baby
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have
So I don't know what to expect from you tonight
But I'm not trying to waste nobody's time
I'm just trying to find material, some inspiration
We can put it in a song, if you want

[Pre-Chorus]
But the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word
And I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
And I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
And I'm just trying to get you high without a word
And I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
And I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
And I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to let you leave without a word
Without a word

[Post-Chorus]
Please, please, please
Ooh, let me, let me, let me
Let me, get what I want this time

[Verse 3]
I'll never fall for a girl like you
I'll never understand what you're going through
But your body wild and your head game too
You lookin' at my nigga, you can have him too
'Cause baby, I ain't cuffing, girl, I hope you knew
There ain't nothin' wrong, you can pick and choose
Just don't call tomorrow askin' "What did I do?"
Girl, you know what you did, all to blame is you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the least I deserve is no conversation
I been working all week
I'd rather be your enemy
Than any friend you think I would be

[Chorus]
I'm just tryin' take you home without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to kiss your neck without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to lay you down without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to get you high without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you numb without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you cum without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to let you leave without a word, without a word

[Verse 1]
Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 2]
The Judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind calls
She comes to my grave and she moans o'er my bones

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Outro]
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've given up, I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 1]
Emily tries but misunderstands (Ah, ooh)
She's often inclined to borrow somebody’s dreams 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let’s try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse 2]
Soon after dark, Emily cries (Ah, ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse 3]
Put on a gown that touches the ground (Ah, ooh)
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Goodbye, cruel world, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, all you people, there's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind, goodbye
(Intro)

[Verse 1]
From the ice age to the dole age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered:

[Chorus]
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

[Verse 2]
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale:
"Oh I say"

[Chorus]
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

[Outro]
Send me the pillow (pillow)
The one that you dream on
Send me the pillow (pillow)
The one that you dream on
And I'll send you mine

[Hook - cudder]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 1 – cudder]

It’s been a couple days since I started drinking
It’s been a couple days since I started thinking
Bout You Pal How is you in her arms
I want to do a Die in your arms song
Armstrong I’m strong, I’m a reach the moon
I tell tales of the world in my tunes
I’ll show them one day that this my sacrifice
I’ve got the skills to sing crackles crackling 5
I stand here still waiting for rain
Damn I know this life is so painful yet
Hateful but Graceful
I don’t care adjectives, meanings are fateful
My girl faithful before we broke up
She says we were not right her eyes soaked up
She left me there with my heart broken
No matter if she’s taken I’ve got the tokens

[Hook]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 2]
Look Here Baby It’s me and Don coda
Low on the border high on the soda
Chuck! Don coda really hot!
Me! I’ve got a kind of cold heart
Shawty still bowling
We ain't rolling
Roll some Change in my cart we ain't holding
We ain't folding we are sold in
We are out of the house
It’s too much cold inside
You see that thing bright
That our ring light
Scary looking down because us at much height
We going to fight because we are fighters
May see us running but we not hiders
We burn it to the ground we lighters
Doubles! Sorry Missed Me because it’s My Turn
They’ll maybe burn you again and again
Hey I think in this lane I’ve been playing Baby

[Hook]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 3]
Hey Girl Long Time No See
Everyone thought you was dead but me
Trust me, you love me
Everything’s going down like the fluffy music Dub-D Ah!
If haters could reach us we’d be flying
World crying! And Attention this is violence
Hey Man Don’t you see this band is dying
Sorry we couldn’t save it a tick of silence
Homie Lean on me
Trust is love you’ve shown me
Without you I’m feeling lonely
Nobody’s there you are the only
I rap about the winning map
Rap about the fastest lap
Lapping and I’m happy
And I’m happy because I’m rapping
Tapping phone calls
My knees have faced fall
I liked baseball
Now, Attention I hate halls

[Hook]
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn

[Verse 1]
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no"
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience short
Or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
You won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you
Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh

[Verse 2]
See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga, look into my eye

[Hook]
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh

[Verse 3]
And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like it don't carry a confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him
Hoping I don't take their bitch, but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government
These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
You can't 'school' a dean
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
All cause they all a facade, my God
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience
All because who I are, Lamar

[Hook]
But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go

[Outro]
But we can't go... backwards

[Intro]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

[Verse 2]
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

[Bridge]
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby
Ohhh

[Verse 3]
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

(Heal me my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

[Chorus]
When I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
Oh when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling
'Cause I'm all alone
Sexual healing, darling
'Till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate

[Verse 1]
Yeah, bring an amp up here
Let me plug my guitar in
I wanna play for you baby
Can you hear me?
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
I'm kind of nervous
And they yellin' my name out
Can you hear 'em?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (woah, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

[Chorus]
Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closin', doors are closin', doors are closin'
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

[Verse 2]
I really love my fans
So we gotta move quickly
And once I finish here
Don't shout out encore
You can sing along to my songs, and then
Then I'll applaud you, and then

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (woah, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

[Chorus]
Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closin', doors are closin', doors are closin'
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

[Bridge]
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better, live so much better

[Chorus]
Private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closin', doors are closin', doors are closin'
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

[Intro: DJ Scream]
Yea
If Trap Music ain't motherfuckin hip-hop
I can't tell my nigga
Cause y'all doin' what we does
It's Gucci, Shawty Red nigga
Let's go

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the tree

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a Success story, take a look at my journey
In a trap house full of niggas, tryna get them some money
Remix, fix fake bails, pills and dummies
RIP my uncle Sunny and my homeboy Lonny
I trick so many people, should go church on Sunday
But I would be a hypocrite because the work come Monday
I grew up so fucked up, that's I'm oh so cunning
And I can honestly tell you niggas that I'm so dishonest
Let's give a shout out to the ducks, in the world I punish
You think Gucci give a fuck, you got one thing coming
If you's a buster, me and you have nothing in common
Trap house, stash house, all I rap bout money
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The pill so strong, make you grit your teeth
The smoke so strong, higher than the tree

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Futuristic wrist watch if you rollie tic toc
Then it's not a rollie, hold your rollie it to the tip top
Six shot, big shot, top down but tits out
Rolls Royce, drop top, call Alfred Hitchcock
I miss Big, I miss Pac
She walked out, she bitched out
She suck the dick non-stop
I think I hit the jackpot
She act out, she ashed out
We ranned out, you're handout
Rappers say they stand out
But yet they got they hand out
If trap music ain't hip-hop
Then Gucci Mane ain't hip-hop
Humble county grow houses then we have a great crop
Hard in the paint trap but nigga I can blake out
They shorted me 300, But I served his ass a shake ounce

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
A bitch I can't catch is something I've never seen (I've never seen)
A bitch I can't catch I will never see (I'll never see)
She come around me, she won't wanna leave (won't wanna leave)
Her game so good, have her onto me
You niggas spilled the drops but drops I never see
My dope so clean, make your nose bleed
The feel so strong, make you breach a tear
The smoke so strong, higher down the tree

[Intro]
What's around me?
What's around me?
What's a—what's around me?

[Chorus 1]
Liquid washed down my throat like soap
I don't wanna think about the shit that's warped
I don't wanna be deep on this beat
But I can't fucking let go of what's around me

[Verse 1]
Cap locks are still on when I log off to sleep
My baby stays awake for every dream I try to keep
No matter what they say, I'll carry on thinking this way
I oversee my life and what's happened to me

[Chorus 1]
Li—li—li—liquid washed down my throat like soap, yeah
I don't wanna think about the shit that's warped
But—but I don't wanna be deep on this beat
And I can't fucking let go of what's around me
Liquid washed down my throat like soap
Yeah, I don't wanna think about the shit that's warped
But—but I don't wanna be deep on this beat
And I can't fucking let go of what's around me

[Bridge 1]
Yeah, my left side is my right side
If it's vice versa, I'm still the same side
If my left side is my right side
If it's vice versa, I'm still the same side

[Bridge 2]
Stay a little, gets better
I never trust a letter
They left or right, don't matter
I'll just get a new writer
Stay a little, gets better
I never trust a letter
They left or right, don't matter
I'll just get a new writer

[Bridge 1]
Yeah, my left side is my right side
If it's vice versa, I'm still the same side
If my left side is my right side
If it's vice versa, I'm still the same side

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I don't wanna get lost on your screen
Except when it's hit by a big sunbeam
I want you to know my thought stream
That's why I'm always trying to stay in my dream
I don't wanna get lost on your screen
Except when it's hit by a big sunbeam
I want you to know my thought dream
That's why I'm always trying to stay in my dream
Cap locks are still on when I log

[Bridge 2]
Stay a little, gets better
I never trust a letter
They left or right, don't matter
I'll just get a new writer
Stay a little, gets better
I never trust a letter
They left or right, don't matter
I'll just get a new writer
Stay a little, gets better
I never trust a letter
They left or right, don't matter
I'll just get a new writer
Stay a little, gets better
I never trust a letter
They left or right, don't matter
I'll just get a new writer

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
It's the world's greatest (Ruff Ryders)
Make you throw your bike's up
Make you rep your hood, now scream
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Murda Mook]
I think I'm getting why these motherfuckers hate me
Cause I've been putting pressure on everything lately
And I'm here pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that being said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of y'all it's no courtesy
I'm not a nest so won't none of y'all burden me
Next generation of the double R lights up
I'm the next nigga that's gon' make 'em throw they bikes up
I literally had millions watching me
On stage turning dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cash
These niggas is chickens in beef
Steady talking bout they go ham
You confused, you meat lover
I got Swizz feeling like Dre when he made Deep Cover
I'm the next Double R meal ticket
Made like a deck of cards nigga, deal with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drag On]
My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull on the Phantom when you see a don in it
Glove box you might see the Quran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong with it?
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relay my bars and remastered every one
Nigga's wondering where the fuck Drag at
I'm on Twitter hitting everybody back
Drag to the dash, I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came with
If I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change shit
Now I'ma shine when the rain get thick nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
All the pretty girls go round the outside
Porsche or the Range Rover, meet me in the ride
Windows all jet black you ain't gotta hide
Donnie, Razor Ramone, Bobby Backlund
This my throne cranberry silver patron, they love me
Hat back like I'm 15 face clean
Nice blue jeans sitting on the Louie
I used to run base and I don't mean ???
A long way from Dr Jays and Conways
I still like hoodrats, some Beyonces
Pop off you ain't ever seen AK's
Top down, Eddie Levert and the O'Jays
Donnie killing that UFO
It took a little while but Donnie gon' blow
Hater's seen Sheek nope, Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Ayo, personally I think I'm underrated if nothing else
Ask around, they'll tell you Jada is something else
Motherfuck who they know
It's the kid with the diesel bars and 

[…] flow
It's a couple dudes I ain't got rid of yet
But it ain't no rush, niggas is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it's time for the blood to get spilled
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed
Hustler, artist, CEO
On the low blowing strawberry Kiwi dro
Sling cane til they cut off my hands, other than that
I'ma spit pain til they cut off my glands
Got work all over the stove, getting money all over the globe
In the Range all over the road
Cribs and the whips is lavish
Double R mob life, Kiss a savage

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Styles P]
You know me, playing 'Kiss and Ne-Yo with your bitch
Or she can call time, run a trio on your bitch
Shoot 'em in the mouth, bet you he ain't gonna snitch
Fucking with 3 bad niggas
Telling your girlfriend to tea bag niggas
She's wavy, we crazy
ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money, mansion, Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, OG's, crack babies
Loading up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine avocado, salad with the lamb and
Cilantro head honcho, rocking a poncho
Way out in Mexico
10 for the bird let you place the decimal
Turn your ass vegetable

[Hook]

[Verse 6: DMX]
You the next nigga, well, I'm the X nigga
Name still ringing bells so fuck the rest nigga
I do this shit for real, y'all niggas is acting
I'm old school like Andre the giant and Bob Backlund
Cats ain't never been able to ever
Fuck with the dog, whatever the weather
I come through, niggas bow down like Muslims praying
I'm just trying to understand what these fools are saying
Don't make me, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it came down to, fuck outta here
Cats gotta fear a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to AZ
Bitch you fucking crazy, thinking Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it, as soon as soon as dog spot it
I'ma scratch to the death, till there's half of 'em left
I'm the last of 'em left, till the last of my breath

[Hook]
Go head and blame it on me, We ain't going to blame it on you
We ain't going to blame it on late night ringing on you
We ain't going to blame it on that, we ain't going to aim on you
Said you would never cheat what a shame on you.Times you thinking I'm sleep, shit you thinking I'm sweet
Got your phone on silent all vibrating the sheets.When they took me to jail, thought you was waiting on me
Messing with the same old lames that was all hating on me.All that shit you said all them lies you told
All that shit you did, those fake dreams you sold.It don't take rocket scientist to figure why I'm so cold
Got a ice box in my chest , girl my heart on froze

[Verse 1]
True love is hard to find, so I thought I'd start this rhyme
With a couple bars and lines of leavin' it all behind
I've had all the dimes and all are fine
But now I need the one to call her mine
You know that girl that everybody wants?
But can't have fat ass, nice eyes, high class
I get the last laugh now 'cause she under my arm
Lay down, hittin' Ls, lookin' up at the stars
I tell her, "Listen, I ain't gon' do you wrong
Forget what you hear in all my songs
My old ways is gone, I'ma be real wit'cha
Recently I been lookin' at the big picture
Perfectly framed, see the way I'm workin' the game
Take my name, I'ma share all of my fortune and fame
Beauty or brains, girl, you all the above
True player for real, but now I'm fallin' love

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady

[Verse 2]
You used to the bullshit, the dudes put you through it
Cupid, never shot up nuisance
See with me my love is with the music
But, baby, you can be the next to it (Yup)
My boys say I'm stupid, I need to move along
And when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right
My moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her
And the fellas say I could deal without her
See, baby, I ain't playin' around
I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground
'Cause that's real, real
Just had to tell you how I feel
And the party tonights goin' crazy
But I'm just here with my baby
I love the way that she makes me
I'ma just kick wit' her and break trees, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady
My lady, my lady
I'm 'bout to get high with my lady

[Hook]
Just smokin' weed for hours
Drinking Hennessy for hours

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
That's when I started flipping shit, mixing at the EVE
In '83 World Class beats for free
I hooked up with this fool slinging cookies and shit, just rookies and shit
Stomping out the CPT
It was five niggas showin' muthafuckas the streets
Picked up this cat from Dallas then we went back east
Shit was wild when we broke them muthafuckas a piece
They said 'as long as you don't sing that shit about the police'
Now back on the coast, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly with the business 'til that shit gets done
Makin' money muthafucka, supposed to be havin' fun
But my faculty got fucked cause we fucked off one
They got me drunker than a skunk gettin' paid and shit
Never really considered what was made and shit
Like a Renegade and shit, thanks to shit
Niggas couldn't fade muthafuckin gansta shit
Ice Cube was performin', yeah he ain't no joke
Him and a bunch of Brooklyn niggas servin' nothin' but dope
And we all stayed down, we all kept winnin'
Studios and hoes was just the beginnin'

[Chorus]
In sunshine
(Yeah, I'm just tryin' to live)
My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine
(Yeah, I gotta live)
My life, my life, my life

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They said them niggas was real look how they ballin' and shit
When the business get up in it, it's all new shit
Make sure it's straight cause you gon' hate when yo' shit fake
Be like I can't fuck with that, back to servin' them cakes
I went to the liquor store so I could get me a drank
Then I ounce and just bounce get some pussy and thank
I see my nigga D.O.C. him and the security ballin'
In one of his foe's that muthafucka was crawlin'
He holla'd and shit but I can't hear that nigga jawin'
So I said hold up nigga, got my shit, we all in, he said

[The D.O.C.]
These papers fucked up my nigga you can check it out
If yo' shit fucked too let's put our own fuckin' records out

I got his information and went on my way
Went home and realized, shit I'm givin' paper away
Then there's a knock at the door, my brother Warren G
With some niggas out of Long Beach called 213
We started workin' on Deep Cover, said fuck it, we made it
They played it and they played it, got faded and replayed it
They said it's the shit, G funk shit be knockin'
The Row was bouta' drop and it was on and poppin'

[Chorus]
In sunshine
(Yeah, I'm just tryin' to live)
My life, my life, my life, in the sunshine
(Yeah, I gotta live)
My life, my life, my life
Just smoking' weed for hours
Drinkin' Hennessy for hours

[Verse 1]
Donald Trump said buy an apartment with her (uh)
Buying an apartment with ya
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like jumping over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all

[Pre-Chorus]
They said you love that girl
You need that girl
But don’t you let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who going solo baby?
I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know them lights will never turn off
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

[Verse 2]
Your father really likes me
He calls me son
Your brother, I think he hates me
But you say thats how you know it's right
Your mother invites me to dinner
All of the time
Only thing she’s been grilling is me

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep telling her I love that girl
I need that girl
I won’t let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin' solo baby?
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark

Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Bridge]
It’s strobing, baby, and they burning baby
But don’t worry baby, just stay close to me

This love will keep us about 55 degrees
Don’t mind the lights
Don’t mind the lights
The love is gonna keep us cool
The love is gonna keep us cool

[Chorus]
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark

Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off

[Outro]
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
Rotating bodies, confusion of sound
Negative imagery, holding us down
Social delusion, clearly constructed
Human condition, morals corrupted
Trapped in reaction, lawlessness, war
Dissatisfaction from bowels to core
Devil's technology, strategy for
Human mythologies, urban folklore
Sick of psychology, counterfeit cure
Wicked theology, robbing the poor
Scheme demonology mislead the pure
Strictly strategically studying war
Light shown in darkness, image exposed
Few can see through the new emperor's clothes
Lustful this hustle turn humans to hoes
When the blind lead the blind, just more trouble and woes
It's the mind that they chose
Its designed to stay closed
Standard of jokers, court jester logic
Sick looking cosmics, from schoolyards to college
Primitive man with civilized knowledge
System collapse and he still won't acknowledge
God is the saviour, studies behavior
Trying to fix the mix mind that he gave ya
Stiff-necked scholars on prescription meds
Wishing their problems were all in their heads
Moral dilemma, pride is the root
Misguided from youth, heart divided from truth
Egyptians and Grecians, spiritually dead
Imperially led, by the gods in their heads
Motives and thoughts
Industrial wealth
Global economy, in it for self
Heart full of madness, covered with kind
Pleasure designed to take over your mind
Furnished in godliness, painted in good
This tainted priesthood got real saints misunderstood
While classes in government, set up the veil
And cultivate minds for more mythical tales
Typical Hollywood follies good girl
While vice and corruption take over the world
Motives and thoughts
Check your motives and thoughts
Blind with the wickedness, deep in your heart
Modern day wickedness is all you've been taught
Lied to your neighbors, so you get ahead
Modern day trickery is all you've been fed
Motives and thoughts
Check your motives and thoughts

[Hook: x2]
My sneakers more cleaner than yours more meaner more cleaner
Than yours I got it mastered and my car go faster 85 an hour I'm
About to take them backwards

[Verse 1:]
Yea now that's back to the esscence the freshest
Prince that's in your presence the uniform on backwards
The f and f eleven it's a laster went from a thrower to a crasher
(ooh) now while that's flowing right past ya let me take a second
To add up all the factors a-trak on the track and lupe is the rapper
Man about town crown member or swagger supreme world attention
Getting glistened and forever resistance to anything non pimping
Or wacker I'm much flyer united I'm N.A.S.A, I'm much higher not a puffer
I'm a passer not a rusher or a tackler I ain't gotta cuff her or
Tag her like I'm a graffer or harraser I grind should be on the cover of Thrasher
Chilling with the cover of king, Nah'mean?

[Hook 1: x2]
My sneakers more cleaner than yours more meaner more cleaner
Than yours I got it mastered and my car go faster 85 an hour I'm
About to take them backwards

[Hook 2: x2]
But take a second you need to breathe
Gimme a minute I need to breathe
Excuse me man I can't see cause you in my way

[Verse 2:]
So I'm on it like I own it, it sounds like it don it
I do and do to the fact that I'm that I'm the one to they oppenent
But they don't want it turn this flyness into bird flue and serve you
A nice pot of bird stew I'm breaking down my bread like I'm making bird
Food and I be in the stu like I'm a bird to but I just fly like a bird do I doo doo
On the birds man I'm high enough to do though I'm sitting on the wires admiring
The view I can still relate to the tires and the shoes dropping shows for they soul
Passions for they inner tools and I run flat while your running your trap I come
Through take your chedder take your fedder and the blue then leave behind a
Letter I'm adressing it to you, you need to build it better for the veterans salute cause

[Hook 1: x2]

[Intro]
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh...

[Verse 1]
Padded by locks, the door knob singed
A rusty close to a door knob hinge
Remembering the sounds
We used to know

But when those sounds sang from our halls
The backstop pressed against bleached walls
Do you remember the sound
Of snow?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And these flames
Boil in reclaim, on the way down

[Chorus]
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh
On the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh

[Post-Chorus 1]
Behind the road
You wait for
Love...

[Verse 2]
So I said follow me down this time
I wrote the rules, but you've got the time
So can you help me?
I've got to break free

[Pre-Chorus 2]
From these chains
Oh, from these chains on the way down

[Chorus]
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh
On the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh

[Post-Chorus 2]
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh...

[Bridge]
Your eyes are closed before us
Your sighs are all around
Inside, the walls have fallen
And now you're all alone

[Chorus]
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh

On the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh

[Post-Chorus 1]
Behind the road
You wait for
Love...

[Post-Chorus 2]
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh...

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
These hoes are trifling

But she out here creeping

Just cause she's fine with ass, man she just want a nigga with cash
She trifling

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shawty got a man but she creeping oooh
I guess she want a young nigga eating her
But I was never known to keep a ho
Met her in Mia, was with my nigga Tre a week ago
In fact, he told that he ate two weeks before
She said she ain't fuck in months, I'm like you sneaky ho
But I switch them bitches like my sneakers though
Fucking all my homies she was trynna keep a secret though
Loving the crew, love the place for the team
She sucking my dick, guess she's chasing that dream
I made her go ham, he made her a queen
I ain't chasing these hoes, nigga I'm chasing this cream

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
These hoes are trifling
That's why we ain't gon' wait for 'em
These young niggas better smart up

[x3] (noooooo)
Just cause she's fine with ass, man she just want a nigga with cash

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
She look good but to me she's just a bummy bitch
Tryna fall in love cause she know I'm bumpy rich
Hear my name ringing, she know I'm on my tip
She can't walk out her house without hearin'em play my shit
2008 came in this game and I have made a grip
I’m sucker-duckin, fuckin' with the ones I made it with
One thing they knew about the hustle, I don't save a bitch
She be content with saying she done fucked a famous crip
Basic bitch that we flippin' you be laying with
Her pussy played out, they call it Avirex
O-B-G-Y-N she got you in labor with
Your maybe baby cause you're weak and be chasin' your dick nigga

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
These hoes are trifling
That's why we ain't gon' wait for 'em

Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of hip-hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs
Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain't have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
This is my life and I look at it like its my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dump'n out the roof

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Let the kid's sing

[Chorus: Children's Choir]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Uh, huh
Thinkin' back when things were so easy
Got me laughin' out loud, for no reason
I use to take them cans back and collect them nickels
Trading Garbage Pail Kid cards for sweet pickles
The whole block used to have G.I. Joe battles
Yeah, your boy had the original Storm Shadow
And as of lately, things have been slow
So I reminisce on when we use to break them windows
Yeah, 'til I got snatched by the cops
With a Wiffle Ball bat and a hand full of rocks
Consider this song a throw back
'Cause all I wanna do is go back
Ya'll sing it with me

[Chorus: Children's Choir]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Tell 'em
And this was way before PlayStation
Rushing home to watch Video vibrations
Man, I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business
And I can't forget Rachel from Caribbean Rhythms
This was back when Rap City used to play the jams
This is how I first heard about the Wu-Tang Clan
Banged 36 chambers all summer long
And to this day, Canopy's my favorite summer song
And I can drop names for days
Of all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way
But we probably need a lot more than just four minutes
So this is how I'm gonna end it, everybody sing

[Chorus: Children's Choir]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I'm on the bus in the back lounge
Sweaty, cold, confused in another unfamiliar town
Another sold out show
Spillin' my soul to a ton of people I don't know
And I can feel my skin wearin' thinner
Fourth night, no appetite for dinner
Shit, goddamn, well, ain't life grand?
Gettin' paid to stand on stage with your heart in your hand
Sometimes I squeeze it 'til they get worried
If this is Groundhogs Day, I guess I'm Bill Murray
And I swear I'm not complainin' at all
I love each and every one of ya'll
All I'm really sayin' is...

[Chorus: Children's Choir]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Hook]
And they think they know you
Till one day they show you
So no matter what they say I go hard
And they think it’s over, but it’s never over
’cause soon as you think I’m down I go hard

[Wiz Khalifa]
Get up it’s that bitch card, been here before
But don’t ever let them see you on the ground
Dues, what you gotta pay, and people see you gotta say
So don’t ever let them see you on the ground

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah ya’ll, hey ya’ll
Dangerous thoughts mind of a militia
Bottles of the one fifty poured over twisters
Broken bones the pillars, Staten Island’s the illest
The biggest land fillers we creep like caterpillars
Love razors, dirty guns with a few bodies
Teach niggas how to walk again from the fucking shotty
Sixth sense, six pack, six degrees of separation
My evil third eye blinks with no hesitation
Dust bags, spoonfuls of sugar help the medi
Go down smooth and steady blowin' the green deadly
And weed pops isolator of hash bricks
Needle left stuck in his arm, died of a bad fix
We still rock, still dry drawers on the stove
Got bread from back in the days that’s growing some more
2Pac’s back, my Glock’s fat
After the guns smoke you’re screaming ‘where my block at?’

[Hook]

[Boy Jones]
I go hard like Listerine on bacteria
Hulk so hard he got the power to avenger her
I go hard, herbal tea, kidney cleanser
I go hard LA Dwight Howard
Lungs pounding hard too much smoke in the chimney
Fire plus iron evaporates the enemy
Jason Statham mechanic all mechanically
Right about now I can really use some Hennessy
I go hard like you never thought I could
One swing with the hammer the nails in the wood
My iron fist is so ridiculous
Forever, continuous, venomous and dangerous

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east

[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury

[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

[Verse 4]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?

I'm wild as can be and I want, want you boy
I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

[Outro: Lana Del Rey and Unknown Rapper]
I'm delicious
You can't touch this
I'm that bitch that
You can't fuck with
She's delicious
Ima cuff it
She that bitch that
I wanna fuck with

[Verse 1]
Wish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too?

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

[Post-Chorus]
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

[Verse 2]
My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light, I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires?"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush (rush, rush)

[Post-Chorus]
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of it all
Love you just a little too much, much
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

[Bridge]
Just have fun
(Wanna play you like a Gameboy)
I don't want one
(What's the thrill of the same toy?)
La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Just have fun
(Wanna play you like a Gameboy)
I don't want one
(What's the thrill of the same toy?)
La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Oh!

Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush

[Intro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

[Verse 1]
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Golden metal flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind livin' on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gon' take money to go

[Chorus]
Oh, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
Said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

[Chorus]
Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no

[Bridge]
I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

[Outro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

[Verse 1]
Oh say, can you see my stars?
The nighttime is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours

[Verse 2]
The headlights from passin' cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"
And I will
The nighttime is almost ours

[Verse 3]
The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing 'til you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost ours

[Verse 1]
Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going to leave you?

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand, mmm
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, mmm

[Verse 2]
Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray has gone to meet you?
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand, mmm
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, mmm

[Bridge]
One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone
One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, mmm
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, mmm

[Outro]
One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone
One, two, make it fun
Make it fun, make it fun

[Verse 1]
Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Vicious in flames
Roland is dyin'
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

[Verse 2]
This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are livin' proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

[Bridge]
If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

[Chorus - Variation]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

[Outro]
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Cut

[Verse 1]
You're like a fake diamond
Sparklin' when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

[Chorus]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

[Verse 2]
You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissin' me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

[Chorus]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

[Bridge]
Baby I can hold you tight
Let me love you right
In the middle of the night
I don't wanna fight
Give it to me
Sing it to me
Show me the light
(You say it's not true, but I know how you do, boy)

[Chorus]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
Real rap, I knock rhymes right off of your skull cap
You can't see me when I step into the booth
Your wish list, K.Dot, yeah I'm the truth
Stuntin, you'd better get your broom
Cause I'm flying with witches and we're going to the moon
With this album, debut at that
I'm so fly I might float with the bats
Y'all know the most
Biggie and Pac, they behind me as my ghosts
Cause you think they write for me when I step into the drop
My shit is so sweet, candy flavored, no you're not
Skeletons in my closet
And no, you can't get up off it
This the freestyle, trick or treat
Halloween, better come with me, I'm sweet
Pumpkins, smacking them across they head
And I'm pokin' eyeballs out on the web instead
He gonna gonna keep going
Baby, sex tape killed me
Ye, ye, I'm so fly, right now I'm so high
Matter of fact oh we talking about the hurricane
I'm talking about New York, I pray for y'all, know what I mean
I don't want that to happen, cuz if so I might just start rapping
Kim Kardashian, Wiz did that ass in

[Laughter]
Coming straight from Compton, I thought y'all know
I ain't gonna look at the cards yet, cause I'm 'bout to flow
Matter fact, this the perfect part to talk about them Lakers
Everybody that's disrespecting, y'all the fakers
We gonna keep going, off the top of the dome
Mavs, y'all gonna go home
Teach y'all to come back to my city
Shrink you, G
Five times, four times, that's the repeat
Obama, we ain't gonna talk about Ritt Momney
Because he's whack, fugazi, fugazi
I don't need to talk about the flow that I'm in
If you gonna vote, vote for Obama
He's gonna win, fo sho
And we gonna keep on going
Off the top, we just gonna keep on flowing
We gonna get back to this little punk, he's crap
Mitt Romney, show 'em how to rap
Matter fact, this freestyle is just dedicated to him
You're homeboys right now with Slim
Your chances, you're not gonna win
You need to go back to where you came from, boy
It's the ruler of the game
Obama, vote now homeboy, he's got change
What's up

[Verse 1]
Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star
I've ever seen, and I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, "back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry bomb
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "let's go, let's go"

[Chorus]
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Verse 2]
If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, "shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "let's go, let's go"

[Chorus]
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Bridge]
I know that they say that all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Chorus]
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Intro: Usher]
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules

[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

[Break: Usher]
Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey
For the rest of my life

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
If I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?
Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"

[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

[Break: Usher]
Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey

[Interlude: Usher]
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup (fill up your cup)
Lift your lighters, a toast to life

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...

[Outro: Usher]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Hey girl I'm tearin it up and they knowin that
I had sex so much that I ain't goin back
I blow stack after stack after stack after stack
At the rack everyday and they knowin that
Well I'm blowin that and I'm doin this
And my red flag got the haters pissed
Don't reckless, this not a diss
This not a threat, this real shit
And don't play me, cause ain't no stoppin me
Ain't no toppin me, and ain't no robbin me
Cut the robbers outs, I brought the goons out
We reckless, we O.G
On Acuras and they textin us
But who gives a fuck and who gives a damn?
I'm blood in and blood out on Flat Shoals with big sand
And Waka Flocka, thanks Flocka Waka
Two times, cause we two crimes
Two bloods and two rides with fo' nines and gang signs
So what's up? The pricety, I'm icey and Icey
I'm the king of diamonds and the princess shinin
And all mine behind me

[Hook: repeat 8X]
Let's get reckless, let's get reckless

[Cap]
Oh yeah! Cap, I'm in beast mode
Hell yeah I'm on reckless
If you don't like it pussy nigga come check this
Respect this or meet your death wish
There's 17 bird on my necklace
I fuck with dem and they fuck with me
Don't fuck with us, get the fuck from 'round
Cause I like to pop and we sucker free
Reckless, reckless, e'rybody goin HAM
Don't test this, cause if you do
That Smith & Wesson go blam, damn
Look what the fuck done happened
Just cause you heard that a nigga start rappin
That I'm worryin about the {?} pulled out
No toppin, no clappin, clear the whole scene I'm smashin
Bye, gone - boy you better catch up nigga
Get hit from your neck up nigga
Nobody wan' fess up, get your block up
Leave the whole scene full of ketchup nigga
They are wildin, on wildin, on ballin, they violent
I got the little man sydrome, get me in the end zone
Signin autographs who's stylin?

[Hook]

[Chill Will]
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Vacation in Miami, they say I'm swag surfin
Your girl with ya she ain't lookin but her ass flirtin
See I'm a classy nigga, a thousand dollar curtains
And I just made yo' nigga mad cause his pocket hurtin
And I don't mean I'm jackin off when I say I'm chokin chickens
I mean, when we rap on mo' we call that chokin chickens
I got a talkin code, for all he knows it folds
Too buck to be on probation, too rich to be on parole
My dawgs love me on I'm on the mic talkin reckless
Stuntin, ballin, million dollar flexin
My dawgs love me on I'm on the mic talkin reckless
Stuntin, ballin, millionaire flexin

[Chorus]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Interlude]
Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

[Verse 1]
It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly, I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it, I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze, cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

[Chorus]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Interlude]
Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

[Verse 2]
Uh… time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse, crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, "I like attention"
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, "Thanks so much," you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

[Chorus]
Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Outro]
Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

[Chorus]
This AR, I have no license for
So I don't give a damn, we can still go to war
This AK, I have no license for
Well, I don't give a damn, you just started a war
Let's go to war, nigga. Yeah, mm mm
Let's go to war, nigga. Yeah mm mm
Let's go to war, oooh. Let's go to war

[Verse 1]
Maybe cause I sell X pills, my nig
I don't have to worry about bills and shit
It's been 28 years, never missed no meals
Cause everybody knows I'll steal some shit
East Atlanta niggas like to start that shit
Dem Boulder crest road niggas kill ya quick
See I ain't have to pull my K out this year
But don't think I won't unload the clip
I been lettin' shit rock for a month or mo'
But now I'm finna show you who control the show
Glock .45 with extended clip
Comin' off the hip, I ain't ready to rip
Rapid blood loss so he startin' to drift
Light shining bright & he ready to dip
No ambulance, just cancel the trip
Cause his hoes ain't got no money at the funeral here

[Chorus]
This AR, I have no license for
Well I don't give a damn, we can still go to war
This AK, I have no license for
Well, I don't give a damn, you just started a warLet's go to war, nigga. Yeah, mm mm
Let's go to war, nigga. Yeah mm mm
Let's go to war, oooh. Let's go to war

[Verse 2]
I bought a sawed off shottie then I got me some bullets
Leave a hole in any nigga think he a bully, PUSSY
I wouldn't run from a dog
Glock .40 leave a dog ass stuck to the wall
Beat you wit a pistol tryna tear off yo arm
Chest shot close make you cough up a lung
Rum ba bum bum bad men come come
Bad man run cause I carry a gun
Which one of you muthafuckas be-a there? NONE
Off witcha head and you heard what I said
Infrared dot long trey 57s, tech 9s, 22s and mac 11's
My goons got guns, nigga, we got weapons
And we got shots & we sho ain't selfish
My money straight, we can start armageddon
I got a machine gun so don't bring a machette
GUCCI!

[Chorus]
This AR, I have no license for
But I don't give a damn, we can still go to war
This AK, I have no license for
But, I don't give a damn, you just started a war
Let's go to war, nigga. Yeah, mm mm
Let's go to war, nigga. Yeah mm mm
Let's go to war, oooh

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Some of us get a little, and some a lot
We've got to make do with whatever we got
We get it hot, we cool it down, and then we pass it around
Oh, you can dance for the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid of whatever's in your way
Next stop, big hop, it's turning night into day
(Uh-uh) Sometimes, when I'm lying there all alone
(Uh-uh) I think of every little nothing that we could own
(Uh-uh) To overthrow all of you who have overgrown

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
All my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go, all we know, heavy load start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(Uh— Wow!)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
I've come to learn whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into whatever light we bend
Out on the street, I get a beat and then I turn it to ten
(Uh-uh) Lace boots and the ladies of Kazakhstan
(Uh-uh) Kick them high to the sky, all of this just because we can
(Uh-uh) I turn to Cuba, then Aruba, then the Dominican

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
All my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go, all we know (Two things I wanna say now)
Heavy load start to float (You make it all okay now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
We've got to move it, if we want to do our best
We've got to shake it, if we want to keep it fresh
(Hah)

[Verse 3: Anthony, John Frusciante]
I'm turning down all the heavy psychology
To cut a rug and I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key and then I turn it for free
(Uh-uh) We've got to move it just a little to hit the spot
(Uh-uh) A whirling dervish in a flurry, a fox to trot
(Uh-uh) Come clown around, a robot (Uh-uh) doing the astronaut

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
All my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go, all we know (Two things I wanna say now)
Heavy load start to float (You make it all okay now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Instrumental Outro]
Faces filled with joy and cheer
What a magical time of year
Howdy Ho! It's Weasel Stomping Day
Put your Viking helmet on
Spread that mayonnaise on the lawn
Don't you know it's Weasel Stomping Day?
All the little girls and boys
Love that wonderful crunching noise
You'll know what this day's about
When you stomp a weasel's guts right out
So, come along and have a laugh
Snap their weasely spines in half
Grab your boots and stomp your cares away
Hip hip hooray, it's Weasel Stomping Day

(Sounds of weasels getting stomped on, with bone-crunching and rodent-screeching effects)

People up and down the street
Crushing weasels beneath their feet
Why we do it, who can say?
But it's such a festive holiday
So let the stomping fun begin
Bash their weasely skulls right in
It's tradition, that makes it okay
Hey everyone, it's Weasel Stomping
We'll have some fun on Weasel Stomping
Put down your gun, it's Weasel Stomping Day
Hip Hip Hooray, it's Weasel Stomping Day
Weasel Stomping Day
Hey!

[Hook]
Whatever might go down, we gon' survive that
Food, clothes and shelter, we gon' find that
When you hear this sound, you know that I’m back
Hey, it’s where I put your mind at

[Main Verse]
When that disaster hit, don’t you get trapped in it
You must always stay prepared with your disaster kit
In the club you might be drunk and you may laugh a bit
But when you sober up you know it hits what you have to get
Stay prepared, never be fear for no evil scared
These natural disaster, cannot be compared
So rise and realize you will survive
In the mean time prepare yourself with these supplies
Get coils of rope and coils of wire, in a water proof container
Put all your fire, like matches and candles, and don’t wear sandals
Get some hard boots and work gloves to handle
The situation, cause when disaster hits the nation
You and your family gonn need your medication
Antibiotics, aspirins, don chronic
Even health foods like vitamins and garlic
Pain relievers, inhalers and breathes
And make sure you got something that can take down a fever
A spray bottle of water, with 10% bleach
So you can disinfect the objects you reach
And speaking of bleach, here’s what I teach
Don’t think that you can drink the water from the beach
You gonn have to drink that water from your hood
And purify the water to make sure it’s all good
Put things in order
Put 8 drops of pure unscented liquid bleach
Into the water, use only 8 drops for every 1 gallon you working
You’ll need about 5 gallons a person
With no water, things could get lethal
It’s dehydration, not starvation that kills people
So look for the water first, don’t be robbing and looting and stealing and killing
That will only make things worse
Be smart, plan ahead, save some cash, a radio, some gas
And some blow up beds
Keep your disaster kits high on the shelf
With your weapons, you might have to defend yourself
Get a flash light, chemical light sticks and whole that
A compass, some dry food, maybe a road map
Don’t forget things like peroxide, listerine, bandages and antihistamines like Bendadryl
So when things get ill, you will survive
Cause you really got skill
You opened your eyes
After you got through your list of supplies
Check your attitude, know that you gonna survive

[Hook]

[Skit 1: DeRay Davis]
Now beat that!
And your mother's saying "Go to college"
So you finish college and it's wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and craziness
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey!
Now you'll get that 25-thousand dollar job a year
And you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine
But, it'll be YOUR money
No more borrowing from mom for my high!
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back
You're so excited about it
If you continue to work at the Gap, after several interviews, oh my God
You'll come in at a entry-level position
And when you do that
If you kiss enough ass
You'll move up to the next level
Which is being the secretary's secretary
And boy is that great
You get to take messages for the secretary
Who NEVER went to college
She's actually the boss's niece!
So now you're part of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart, man
All you kids wanted to talk in the back of the class
Not me, I listened
Okay?
I was a hall monitor
This was meant to be
You know how many classes I took?
Extra classes, extra classes
No, I've never had sex
But you know what?
My degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks up to me and says
"Hey, you know what's sexy?"
No, I don't know what it is
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse
Very fast

[Hook]
That mac-10 will get them off me
Head shots, he still talking

[Verse 1]
You try to run up on Lil Wayne, I let you hold the slug
The can opener, will make your jug open up
I'm probly in the crib--baking Up, rolling up
Cause I'm a nut wit the coke, call me coconut
Bet I smack em wit the tooly, tell em straighten up
I'm from the murder capital, you niggas baby butt
You baby mutts get the fuck, I ain't a dog
I'm a Boss Hogg, shout out to Slim Thugga'
Pussy's spraying, that's a shot to ya brim youngin'
I'm so Cash Money, right out the rim brotha
Not out to get nothing but bread, I said I am
Not out to get nothing but bread, I said I
Slide out the whip, looking like a million bucks
Don't touch bet this fucking full clip fill ya up
Hollygrove in this bitch blocka block
Make the chef pull the stove off the hip, cook em up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
If I was to let the barrel spin
None of you niggas be standing
I pull this burner out my drawers
You gonna piss in ya panties
On the block as a younging
I was working that jelly
Knew fat niggas kept bundles under their belly
I’m a motherfucking Young Money
A motherfucking Cash Money
Millionaire, Cash money Machiavelli
They say dress to kill, but I look better at it
Ready for anything, its covered like spaghetti
I’m a nice young d-boy baby
I digest your man like a t-bone baby
Keep on I got the heat on 80
At 90 I’m shooting, at 100 I’m blazin
Concrete jungle the wild-life pavement
That’s my life, my life, my life baby
Don’t get caught up in the twilight craze
Or you'll be just another highlight baby

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Before I had my aim
I still had a pistol
Missing ya whole chest
Hitting ya whole temple
Like 95, 96 getting it in the rental
So short I had to sit on a pillow
Let the whole quaker sit on the griddle
Cook em up and shoot em out like missiles
Boot em up and call em out like bitches
They ain't nothing but bitches
They ain't fucking with this shit
They swinging and missing
My angle is different, they ain’t seeing me
Look into my music, that’s the window to my soul
See the g in me, long hair all black like Easy-E
Little nigga got smack like the DvD
Click-clack sound sweet to me
Pap-pap you look asleep to me (what you saying)
Click-clack sound sweet to me
Pap-pap you look sleep to me
Good night

[Hook]

[Verse 1]

Who?
Weezy baby, baby im crazy yeah
Makin a statement, feel these phrases, bitch
Hear these shots, get the fuck out of here
Low sea level nigga, get your diving gear, yeah
Okay we rocking like a mother fucking quarter in a crackhouse
Kitchen, when its finished I'mma pitch it
I'm a motherfucking chemist I'm a motherfucking menace
I'm a motherfucking dentist, knock your teeth out, fuck nigga
Quarterback, run and shoot, hood nigga shush nigga
The hamburger is tough nigga
You lunch nigga
You get the double deluxe nigga
Thank you very much
Turn a nigga head to mush
That uzi turn your body to a smoothie, slush
Them pussies ain't fucking with us
Them niggas just fucking it up
But I'm laid back, back of the club
Tuss in the cup, tuss in the blunt
Gun in the gut, stunt if you want
Play if you may, try if you like to fly
I put wings on you, and shoot you out the sky
Niggas scared of money, see the chrome outside
Do the homicide, we got the chromers out
Known to ride bonafide on the rise
That corner mine, Eagle street all the time
And bitch niggas don't apply
Naw player call yourself a tiremark
Make a nigga drive way up the sidewalk
Your people paint the concrete red
Blood bath, turn the grass to a water bed(Splash!)
Harder head make a soft-ass, my father said
Short life, faster money sound like honey(Sweet!)
I made it past twenty, I'm an old man
A dead man walking, kill me if you can
Damn, but you the president man
Well I guess I'm a dead president man
Yeah I'm just money, baby trust me
Bet on me, go with me
Man the chance is looking chubby
And we dancing on your grave when you dead boy
2-step, juke juke, I'm a made boy
I'm a made boy, no I'm a made man
I give 'em heead nods, I don't shake hands
Don't take it personal, its part of my position
I feel all police is pussies, baby send me my petition
Fuck 'em! (What you think?)
Yeah that's what I said, an double fuck the FED's
Now what's trouble to a troubled child?
Nothing. what's murder to a murderer?
A thing. get it? it ain't nothing but a thing
Everybody got to lose this, ain't nothing but the game
Yeah an this ain't nothing but them real verses
And if you listening to this, then you a a real person
I got kicked but I'm still lurking, still searching
Got a fetish for desert, squirt like the middle of a jelly doughnut
Off my back wit my pump make his belly gross up
I'm right handed, his right side swoll up
No homo, but my dick couldn't fill his hole up
Niggas hold up, tell them niggas wait
Man get off my dick, nigga just ask your bitch
Niggas hold up tell them bitches wait
The best rapper alive, yeah now what you say?

[Verse 1]
They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I'll remain a staple
My career has been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em, "Think pink"
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh, shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophesy everything I'd do?
But, before I continue, lemme thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I coulda went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"
Lemme get up and go
Seven hundred to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm startin' the show
Man, I'm birthin' these artists and I'm startin' to show

[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

[Verse 2]
Who I wanna work with? Nobody
Ninety-nine percent of them is nobody
Bitches actin' like they killin' shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas goin' broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them ramen noodles
B-B-B-Bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday at Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? 'Cause I must've missed it)
Twelve milli to kick my feet up
Get ready, this is the Re-Up

[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding, baby
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your all for you?
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your all for you?

[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom (Freedom)
Why they mad? (Why they mad?) You should see them
Burn a L (Burn a L) 'cause it's crazy in here (Crazy)
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, (Feel freedom) I feel freedom
Why they mad? (Why they mad?) You should see them (Hey)
Burn a L ('Cause it's crazy) 'cause it's crazy in here ('Cause it's crazy)
Crazy in here (In here), crazy in here
It's crazy in here

[Intro]
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever (Clutch)
Forever

[Verse 1]
You could stop the clock, that wouldn't be time enough
You could let the night turn to morning
I still would be wanting more of your love
There just ain't enough days in a week (Week)
Weeks in a month (Month), months in a year
How can I make it clear?

[Pre-Chorus]
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you) And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless) I'm floating in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient) I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever

[Verse 2]
Give me all your life, and I'd ask you for even more
You can't offer me a part of your body
'Cause honestly (Honestly), it's just not enough anymore
Let's get lost in the moment
You know you want it, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus]
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you) And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless) I'm floating in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient) I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever

[Bridge]
Can you tell me what it is you're waiting for?
Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause I don't know
(Let's go) Come on, baby, just take my hand
(Let's go) Why you looking like you don't understand?
(Let's go) That's it, I'ma make this easy
(Let's go) And that ain't me, believe me, but just

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever

[Outro]
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Both sides
In softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger, flicks you on your socks

[Verse 2]
I go high-pitched
He'll talk and make your voice sound high-pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone
It's the same stone
His heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw
It's impossible not to feel inferior

[Chorus 1]
And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph
Is as hollow as the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying bye

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
And you will queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl blub
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessantly pestering him to let him join the club
He knows how to put a cork in the fuss
And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

[Bridge]
There's a dust track waiting for betrayal
Where he'll teach you all the bits they missed

[Outro]
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
You cannot turn away

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I-I-I could pay for everything that's on you (Yeah)
So everything is on me (Woo)
Got them girls going Cindy Lauper
GaGa and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy? You're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass
Just bottles, and I'm buying everybody one each

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothin'
Just keep the bottles coming all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle

[Bridge]
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
The next top, next top

[Chorus]
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle

[Verse 1]
We've been through the storm
We've been through it all
We had some close calls
But never would fall
We climbed all the mountains
Walked through all the valleys
And you never left me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way through the clouds
No more runnin' scared and closing my eyes, oh
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

[Chorus]
Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

[Verse 2]
They said we wouldn't make it
But guess what, we made it
And we got them wondering how
You were always for me
Never been the one to hurt me
You gave me peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way through the clouds
No more runnin' scared and closing my eyes, oh
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

[Chorus]
Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

[Bridge]
Sometimes I can't believe
That you are with me
There's nobody lucky as me
So I get on my knees
To make sure that He
Knows that I'm grateful
For what He gave me

[Chorus]
Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

[Verse 1]
If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

[Chorus]
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

[Verse 2]
It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

[Chorus]
Coax me out my low
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

[Outro]
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller

[Intro]
Listen up, Princess

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning
Take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, cuz it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son
Baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear-view
And I put that ring on your finger
I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn

[Bridge]
And now I'm by myself, but (I like it)
Damn, she left me all by myself, but (I like it)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I love my niggas; no homo
I swear I hope all get cheese like Digiorno
It's something 'bout the Hot Boyz that you don't know
I gotta love for em that I don't show
And B.G. been my nigga since the front door
I hope Chopper City Records blow
Fa sho'
And me and Juve never really got along
But you still would let yo nigga come get on yo hottest song
Damn, I fuck wit ya for that
I fuck with ya Lil Wack
And me and Skip go back (Skip, whattup!)
When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that
I had my own lawyer working on Turk's case
After I heard him dissin me on the mixtape
Cause he's locked up, and I'm free
He got a lot more to worry about than me
I ain't trippin

[Outro]
Y'all niggas left me by myself, but I can't front (I like it)
And so, now
I've become the President of the spot y'all left me at
A lot has changed, but, I can't font (I like it)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram
I'm in a rich folk's home like a ottoman
I got green in my hand like a Heineken
I'm throwback like a Flinstone's Vitamin
I'm fire! All I need is the brimstone
I make noise in the streets like a ringtone
My top's hot, so I'm gettin my fade low
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo
I'm living so shiny, ya boy on top
My life on track, a nigga can't stop
I'm Weird like Al, I'm strange like love
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater
My hoodie lightsaber, like Darth Vader
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick
Need an Entourage quick so you can hug it out bitch

[Hook]
(I'm so fresh)
Oh yeah oh ye oh oh y, oh yeah oh ye, oh oh oh yeah oh ye, oh-oh oh
Oh yeah oh ye oh oh y, oh yeah oh ye, oh oh oh yeah oh y, oh oh y
Oh yeah oh yeah oh oh oh yeah oh y-bring the beat back

[Verse 2]
I'm so fresh like a Sick Boi oughta be
I'm not tryin that shit, just a part of me
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggas just Snoopy!
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney
I guess you can call me the perfect storm
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born
A nigga so torn call me Natalie
Cause I love making music but they mad at me
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate
I'mma be who I gotta be, that's the epithet

[Hook]

[Hook]
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ain’t another nigga like me
I know these hoes don’t like me
RPTs for your whole family
'Cause your best friend tried to trap me
The world game is so slimy
But all my niggas are grimy
I cut real strutted violin
Beefin over, so icy
Blood all over my Nikes
Man, I’m fucking your wifey
Gucci Mane, I’m not Hify
So don’t jump around me
King of the streets, gon' crown me
Like Cliff Loutter woulda doubt me
Got a white girl like Ice T
Figure white bricks in the SUV
Drug dealers will consign me
Brick Squad, yea we violent
Catch catchers turn silent
Twitter bad bitches are the problem, ported
Came by the jail and I started back ballin'
Phone gotta charge 'cause the hoes keep callin'
Read about you’s, cutting beef and broccoli
And I’m the first nigga to say trapaholic

[Hook]
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
'Cause ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Facing double life, my nigga went to trial
Think he getting out, my nigga in denial
Gave his bitch the Benz just to get around
Quarter milli on his lawyer, money bagging down
Top off of dome, squares off of my trone
Fuck talking on phones already know what my dog want
I push a button and them killers coming
Disrespect me? Niggas get nothing
Seeing 50 keys, started from a crumb
Mad brag, G wagging, riding through the slums
I could take a penny, flip it to a dollar
You will never disrespect me on my red Impala

[Hook]
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
Ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me
Nigga gon' respect me, Nigga best respect me
'Cause ain’t no way in hell I’ma let you disrespect me

[Verse 1]
I spend all my money
Bought a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Verse 2]
I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh, I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much, I know, yes, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

[Bridge]
You, you, you, you
Yeah, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

[Chorus]
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fucked your sister and your girl at the same damn time
All these diamonds that I rock could make a bitch go blind
Yella ice, white ice at the same damn time
Walkin’ straight through the club, I don’t stand in no line
And my glasses Jimmy Jewels but I got them Gucci shoes
With a Louis belt and Prada bag, I swear I’m so confused
I shop at Vista Lenox Mall in the same damn day
Spendin’ 10k in future, feel the same damn way
Serve my baby momma brother, got the same ole grind
Sellin’ bricks, sellin’ bales at the same damn time
I get better every year so my flow is like wine
I’m a rapper and a trapper at the same damn time

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Whipping white and baking soda, at the same damn time
Puffy got a mansion, bitch I got the same damn kind
Went and bought two sixty twos, at the same damn time
Rock an AP and a Rolly, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
Still selling boy and girl, at the same damn time
Selling cane, getting brain, at the same damn time
All the women say my name, at the same damn time
Letting off two different choppers at the same damn time
Putting down in different projects at the same damn time
Dope money still a object, it's the same damn grind
But I got two platinum artists, at the same damn time
Went and got two Maseratis at the same damn time
Liberace, John Gotti, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, it's the same damn grind
Captain boy, cooking crack, at the same damn time
On my Twitter writing raps, at the same damn time
Getting head counting bread, at the same down time

[Verse 3: Wale]
She on Molly, she with Mary, at the same damn time
We the squad, Young Folarin, out that Maybach Mob
Fuck a tape, fuck your broad
Middle finger up, to the mother fucking law
No days off, Gunplay ball, sick with the cross like DeRon going off
At the same damn time
Shape like a eight, face like a nine
Heard she dancin' at Kamal's, and she make too much to stop
And she stripping, go to college
And they trickin' her deposit
While them bitches always gossip, she busy going shopping
At the same, at the same time
And your girl don't show her face when I be FaceTimin'
SB Nike's, with the grey box
You in the past me and Future on the same watch

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time

I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time

[Verse 4: Gunplay]
All black, khaki jumper, actin' a donkey
At the same damn time, got these bitches poppin' monkey
Metro Zoo in here, with my crew in here
With all these hogs in the game no room for you in here
Limo tints on my shades, skinnies on my blades
Crocodile kicks like my hood the Everglades
Rich forever paid
Do it with no effort, now let's effin' celebrate
Toast and spill the grapes, hoes catchin' vapes
Toe touchin' freaks
She jumped on my pole and did a pole trick for me
Slippin' on ya pimpin' that means more grip for me
Chrome lips on the Forgi's damn near swallowing the street
You owe me, homie have that now
I'm a pull that Gat out now
Must be out your rabbit mind, I'm thuggin', rappin', same damn time

[Verse 5: Meek Mill]
I rock Gucci, I rock Louie, at the same damn time
I shoot you and kill ya homie, with the same damn nine
In kitchen, whippin' blow, it got the same damn crumbs
I need a ho that's like my pro without the same damn mind
At the same damn time, gettin' hit on by a couple hoes
Two big faces on my wrist, boy I got a couple those
I told her I love that pussy, she think we a couple though
And she got a boyfriend but she say he a sucka though
At the same time, pull up like James Bond
In that Aston Martin on these niggas, game time
Fresh ass Mike's, my Rollie on ice
Got bitches on Mollies, they rollin' all night
I be way out in Cali, got hoes of all types
With 80 racks in my pocket, nigga I go in all night

[Hook: Everybody]
I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time

[Verse 6: Ludacris]
Yeaah Luda is unstoppable, his money is astronomical
Sell as many records as a nigga like me that shit is just impossible
Rappers is dillusional and now they talking more shit
Anything is lie when it coming out the mouth of a desperate starving broke Bitch
Choke Bitch, you used to be good but now you’re garbage
Any nigga that wanna step up to the plate and battle will get demolished
My flows is rubbing off just like their fingernail polish
You rappers ain’t got no swag, you need to kill your Fucking stylist
They biting like piranhas then crying to their momma
These Niggas best to call their troops back like Obama
That trash that you’re spitting didn’t faze me, matter of fact your record label still pays me
See Luda never starting shit, I’m always on my grind, but I’ll respond to three rappers at the same damn time

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars, at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles, at the same damn time

[Chorus]
Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

[Verse 1]
She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration to be attended on a Wednesday night
It's better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along

[Verse 2]
Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
I'm unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
Even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

[Chorus]
As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

[Outro]
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along
I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse
I got blood on my dick cuz I fucked a corpse
I'm a nasty nigga when u pass me nigga look me in my eyes
And tell me to my fuckin face that u ready to die
U be a dead mutha fucka red mutha fucka
Don't be stupid you heard what I said mutha fucka
Who shot u ohhh nigga like u don't know
Stickin you for your doe while I'm fuckin your broke ho
Yo don't u get the picture niggas can't touch me
Cuz I don't give a fuck G I'll get u touched B
I got choice ripple my slug'll take apart a door
And enuf crazy niggas behind me to start a war
So what u want nigga help me is about your best
When I'm finished Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothin but make u look a little thicker
Cuz in the dark u ain't nothin but a lil nigga
But if you've been thinkin about that shit u did
You wouldn't have brought the joint wit u kid
Now I might have to get u kid and split your wig wit a machedi
I bring beef to niggas and string them out like spaghetti
U ain't ready lord can u stand how I'm bringin it
I'm givin it is how I'm livin it so I'm swingin it
Red dot on your head cuz you's in mid range
Red dot on your chest opens up your rib cage
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!! Uhhh!
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so I gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!

[Verse 1]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

[Chorus]
I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over...

[Verse 2]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

[Chorus]
And I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over
Over and over...
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said:

[Verse 3]
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms..."

[Chorus 2]
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

[Outro]
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

[Chorus]

We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises

Awake from your sleep and slumber
Today could bring your lucky number

[Outro]
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
Sun is shining

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Breakdown]
And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
