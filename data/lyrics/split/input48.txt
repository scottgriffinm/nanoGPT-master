[BEAT RIDES OUT]
Love locked out in all the cold and rain
Love locked out may never come again
Love locked out and weeping bitter tears
But no one ever hears love calling
Though we need the precious gift it brings
We don't heed the song of love it sings
On the door love beats its tiny wings
Just love locked out
A world without love is a world without life
A sad world full of gloom
So please make a place there for love in your heart
It does not need much room
Love is well worth the waiting for
When it comes knocking at your door
Fling it wide, for love locked out will come
No more, no more
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have happiness, and I guess
I never will ever again
When you walked out on me, in walked ol' misery
And he's been here since then

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you...you...you...you…

[Verse 1]
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong

[Chorus]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we are gonna get out

Ooo, ooooo

[Verse 2]
Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohh ohh...
Dreaming of when the morning comes

[Chorus]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out
I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was looking for you
Saxophones started blowing me down
I was buried in sound, taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs I bought downtown
They were translated poorly, I felt like a clown
I looked like someone I used to know
I felt alright and if I ever was myself
I wasn't that night
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only, way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what you want me to be
Oh, I was chewing gum for something to do
The blinds were being pulled down on the dew
Inside, out of love, what a laugh
I was looking for you
Saxophones started blowin' me down
I was buried in sound the taxicabs were driving me around
To the handshake drugs, I bought downtown
To the handshake drugs, I bought downtown
Oh, it's okay for you to say what you want from me
I believe that's the only way for me to be
Exactly what do you want me to be?
Exactly what do you want me to be?

[Chorus:]

[Fading] Finest body that i ever seen before
I may run and hide when you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now there are prices to fame, alright
All of our time's spent in flashes of light

[Chorus]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life, alright

Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

[Chorus]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life, larger than life

That's right, all of your time spent keeps us alive
Every time we're down, you can make it right

[Chorus]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, that's what makes you larger than life, yeah

[Chorus]
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger, that makes you larger

That makes you larger than life
So you lost you trust
And you never should have, no you never should have
But don't break your back, if you ever see this
But don't answer that
Chorus--
In a bullet-proof vest, with the windows all closed
I'll been doing my best, i'll see you soon
In a telescope lens, and when all you want's friends
I'll see you soon
So it came for you it came snapping at your heels
It came snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer that
Chorus
I'll see you soon
And oh, you lost your trust
And oh, you lost your trust
No, don't lose your trust
No, you lost your trust
Learn to earn how, learn how things are

I salute the people who perceive
What's around, they digest, so it clears

Learn to learn love, learn how things are

All the worlds of the world will deceive
The idea before it is conceived

Learn to dream, ah, mystical, al

Express through the body what is meant unconsciously
Well, since she put me down
I've been out doin' in my head
Come in late at night
And in the mornin' I just lay in bed
Well, Rhonda you look so fine
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, yeah
Get her out of my heart
She was gonna be my wife
And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it sure ruined our plan
Well, Rhonda you caught my eye
And I can give you lotsa reasons why
You gotta help me Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, yeah
Get her out of my heart
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
Help me Rhonda, yeah
Get her out of my heart
Help yourself to my heart
It's there if you care to start with it
It's there and I'm willing to part with it
If you'll handle it with care
Help yourself to my love
It's yours if you put your claim on it
The kiss I reserve has your name on it
And it's begging to be shared
I could love you madly
That's just the way I feel
I need your love so badly
But I must know it's real
So help yourself to my heart
Go on, have fun and be gay with it
But once you begin, you must stay with it
Never never to part
Help yourself to my heart
Like a breath of spring you came
And as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumblin'
Honey, you don't owe me anything
'Cause what you gave me, girl
Is more than enough to last, oh yes it is
And what you gave me, girl
Is more than enough to last, oh yes it is
You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my mind, there's a picture of you and I
That nobody has the price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time
'Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last, oh yeah
And what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Givin' me a song to sing, oh yeah, oh yeah
And though I know you're leavin'
I won't be grievin' 'cause I know
Time has a way of showin' us
The things we really need
And no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home, oh baby
Though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
'Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last, oh, yeah, yeah
And what you gave me, hey
Is more than enough to last
I believe that what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
I love you, I love you
Hey, now and what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
Is more than enough, hey now
And what you gave me baby
Is more than enough to last

[Intro]
I know I may be young, but, I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

[Verse 1]
All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, "Little girl, don’t step into the club"
Well, I’m just tryna find out why 'cause dancing’s what I love

[Hook 1]
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it (Do you like it?)
Get it get it, get it get it

[Verse 2]
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical is logical, what the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

[Hook 2]
Baby, don’t you wanna, dance up on me
To another time and place?
Baby, don’t you wanna, dance up on me?
Leaving behind my name and age
(Let's go)
(Like that)
(You like it?)
(Yeah)
(Now watch me)

[Hook 1]
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it (Do you like it?)
Get it get it, get it get it
(This feels good)

[Bridge]
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(I just can’t help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(Wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(Uh, uh, uh)

[Hook 2]
Baby, don’t you wanna, dance up on me
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place?
Baby, don’t you wanna, dance up on me
(Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

[Hook 1]
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

[Break]
Like that
I’m a slave
I’m a slave
I’m a slave
I’m a slave
I’m a, I’m a, I’m a

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it

[Hook 1]
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it

[Chorus]
I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you

Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously
'Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
'Cause nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossess my 4x4
'Cause nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
"Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky"

Did-did-did-did-you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did-you hear the falling bombs?
Did-did-did-did-you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did-did-did-did-you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did-you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on

Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye

[Spoken Intro: Kurt Loder]
Here is someone that's obviously playing rock and roll who is also a Funk artist, who covered a lot of categories that which artists have been separating for so long and brought them together purposely...

Props and pounds
Props and pounds
Love for one another is the only sound today
Positivity is the only way

Chorus:
Props and pounds
Props and pounds
Love 4 one another is the only sound 2day
Negative people don't get to play
Props and pounds
Props and pounds
Why you wanna holler when you know what the bible say
Positivity is the only way

Once again when the coin is tossed
And lands upon the sea
Unsuspecting lives are lost
They didn't have to be
When the book is opened
And The Son condemns them all
Pagan holidays,crucifixes
$100 tears will fall
Chorus :
(hey)
(no play)
(you know it)

All the ones still in the game
Never give me pounds
Egotists to proud to say the opposite of found
Worrying about the validity of the rulers crown
When everyone ought 2 be in line giving props n pounds

Chorus:
(hey hey hey)
(ooow)
Props n pounds
Props n pounds
Props n pounds

Once again when the money get tossed
Never gonna see npg floss
Keeping you happy is the only cost
Love God and everyone or your life will be lost
Listen to the words that will save every one
Safe sex campaign talking about a gun
With CON as the prefix, suffix be the DOM
(dumb)
Look at them both and tell me something
What's in the Trojan Horse? Lubrication
Nothing goes in my woman except The Son

I asked the wiseman one sunny day
Can you help me find my way
You're so much older and wiser too
Would you help me mr wiseman
I'm feelin' blue
Oh I'm not satisfied

He said you're not doin too bad, not bad at all
You're just trying to walk son before you can crawl
You got stacks of money to sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love

He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' to the Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love
Oh mr wiseman I need to find my love

You can have anything in this god's world
But you won't be happy son 'til you find a girl
Now you can be happy boy if you try
Find a woman boy, you'll be satisfied
He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' , I said Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love

He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' , I said Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love

[Verse 1]
And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
"Good god!" or "My!" I cry and die and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God, I couldn't cope
Or had hope eloped, a dope, she roped
This salty lie

[Chorus]
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who, no matter when
No matter where, no better than
The faulty line

[Chorus]
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
I heard the voice and saw the face
And I know he was there
The robe it floated around my bed
And I felt no pain

You can talk about the help you need
He's a friend indeed
Just open your heart and live again
And he'll set you free

Well, he took them away
All the troubles and the pain
Whoa, you can call me a fool
But I know he was there
Yes, I know he was there

The night I had, has long since gone
But the memories stay
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way
I'm not too proud to pray
Yes, he took them away
All the troubles and the pain
Whoa, you can call me a fool
But I know he was there
Yes, I know he was there

Well, he took them away
All the troubles and the pain
Whoa, you can call me a fool
But I know he was there
Yes, I know he was there

The night I had, has long since gone
But the memories stay
And now Mr. Trouble when you come my way
I'm not too proud to pray
Well, have you seen my darkhaired girl?
She was set on her love to a hungry world
They got her clothes anA the money she took
And they wrote her name in the prison books

Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl?
She's tired and cold and you got the gold
She took from a hungry world
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl?

Well have seen my green eyed son?
He shot a man down with a sawed off gun
And they fond him down by the Pontchartrain
Where they cuffed his arms with a big iron chain

Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?
I heard him say as you let him away
Sorry for what he's done
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?

Well have you missed my brother man?
He took a little money with a gun in his hand
Know the kids are hungry and the wife ain't well
And the daddy's locked up in a prison cell
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
I know it's sad but he ain't bad
He's doing the best he can
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

*cell phone rings*

Khalis: Hello, CNN news, how may i help you?
Wyclef: Yo, hello, it's Wyclef, i'm here with Pras
Pras: Yeah, man
Wyclef: We calling you to stop your fucking news
Pras: Yeah
Wyclef: It's suck
Khalis: Man, let me talk to you...
Wyclef: No, it's suck
Pras: Yeah, it's suck
Khalis: OK then

*Khalis hangs up*
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outa you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she steals your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get lucky
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost

I started out on burgundy
But soon I hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to call my bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough
Said I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

[Verse 1]
I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

[Verse 2]
In Dixie Land where i was born
Early on one frosty morn
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

[Verse 3]
I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

[Verse 4]
I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

[Verse 1]
Always on time
You're in white light— but you're wrong, dear
You won't be telling all the lies when I'm gone
And you know it's for show

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Everybody holds onto something
And you can't hide me...

[Chorus 1]
Tell me I'm in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me I'm involved
And we will be fine

I, I, I'm still here
You-ou, ou-ou, ou're in the right
Everybody knows you tried
And I tried...

[Verse 2]
Always on time
You're on my mind— but you're wrong, dear
I won't be telling all the lies when you're gone
The front door opens slow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everybody moves on someday
And I can't find you

[Chorus 2]
Tell me you're in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me you're involved
And we will be fine

I, I, I'm still here
You-ou, ou-ou, ou're in the right
Everybody knows I tried
You tried...

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Your eyes open up
Inside, you're fine

[Chorus 3]
Tell me you're in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me you're involved
And we will be fine
I, I, I'm still here
You-ou, ou-ou, ou're in the right
Everybody knows I tried
And you tried...
I saw a way worn traveler in tattered garments clad
And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad
His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone
But he shouted as he journeyed, "Deliverance will come"

Then palms of victory, crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall wear
Yes, palms of victory, crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall wear

The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow
His garments torn and dusty, his step seemed very slow
But he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home
Still shouting as he journeyed, "Deliverance will come"

Then palms of victory, crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall wear
Yes, palms of victory, crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall wear

[Verse 1]
Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

[Chorus]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions that I recall
I really don't know love
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at all
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

Do you, don't you want me to love you
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter

Will you, won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter

Look out, cause here she comes
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again

Well do you, don't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Look out helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter
Look out helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes she is
Yes she is
Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much

Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown

I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car

Drive my girl in the park

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance

You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all
Song sung blue, everybody knows one
Song sung blue, every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again

Song sung blue, weepin' like a willow
Song sung blue, sleepin' on my pillow
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it starts to feelin' good, you simply got no choice

Song sung blue, everybody knows one
Song sung blue, every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song ya sing 'em out again

Song sung blue, weepin' like a willow
Song sung blue, sleepin' on my pillow
Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it starts to feelin' good, you simply got no choice

Blue
Song sung blue
Blue
You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells
You're clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words, the mud of cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
And you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hard and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates
That tumbled by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me
So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hard and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

I know you are no stranger now
A crooked rainbow trail
From dancing cliffheads shattered sills
To slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below
Its walls are being scaled
Yes, all of this, and more my friend
Your song shall not be failed
My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling)
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you’d turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I’d gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy, sweet
Sequestered days

Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
And truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life forsooth was mine

Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays

Then gay youth was mine
The truth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
Because today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays
People say you love but one at time
For every woman there's a man
My baby say she wasn't put here forever
So she's gonna get as many as she can
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, some people may be wrong sometimes
But they can't be wrong all the time
Like they say a cat has nine lives
Nine loves has the woman of mine
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do

Well, the women are funny these days
They do wrong in so many ways
They'll have a man twiddling his fingers
Or either drinking his life away
What can I do
Yes, I just sing the blues
Well, I just sing the blues
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do
Two heads together are better than one in rainy or sunny weather
The outlook can't be a glum one when there's someone who cares
Just when you're sinking without a straw in sight
Someone starts thinking and everything's all right
Birds of a feather can never be shown that livin' alone is fun
When two hearts are better than one

Two heads together are better than one in rainy or sunny weather
The outlook can't be a glum one when there's someone who cares
Rain in the doorway can have its sunny side
When someone goes your way and her umbrella's wide
Birds of a feather can never be shown that livin' alone is fun
When two hearts are better than one
All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
It's me against the music, it's just me
Britney, are you ready? Yeah

And no one cares, it's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
To hell with stares, this sweat is drippin' all over my face
And no one's there, I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Tonight, I'm here feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep it that bass

I'm up against the speaker
Tryin' to take on my music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone

Where the music
Turns to party all night long
All night long, oh dear, let's go

We're almost there, I'm feelin' it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare, my hips are movin' at a rapid pace
Baby, feel it burn, from the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins
And now's your turn, let me see what ya got, don't hesitate

I'm up against the speaker
Tryin' to take on my music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone

[Chorus]
I'm a hog for you, baby
Can't get enough of your love
I'm a hog for you, baby
Can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night
That's the only thing I'm dreaming of

[Verse 1]
One little piggy went to London
One piggy went to Hong Kong
This little piggy's coming over your house
He's gonna rock you all night long

[Chorus]
'Cause, I'm a hog for you, baby
Can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night
That's the only thing I'm thinking of

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
One little piggy ate a pizza
One piggy ate potato chips
This little piggy's coming over your house
Gonna nibble on your sweet lips

[Chorus]
'Cause, I'm a hog for you, baby
Can't get enough of your love
When I go to sleep at night
That's the only thing I'm thinking of
When I go to sleep at night
That's the only thing I'm thinking of
When I go to sleep at night
That's the only thing I'm thinking of
It's like singin' to empty tables
Or a gallery full of ghosts
Or like givin' a great big party
Where nobody shows but the host
That's what it's been like, baby
That's what it's been like all night
Without you around to applaud me
Every night's just like closing night

And I'm singin', singin' the same old numbers
`n' I'm tellin' the same sad jokes
And there's nothin' out front but mem'ries
And lot of transparent folks
So, please call, call and make a reservation
In our favorite spot for two
`cause I'm singin' to empty tables without you

Without you
Without you
Oh, can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
'Cause if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

And don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too

People talk and try to break us up
When they know they don't understand
But I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holdin' her hand
Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
'Cause if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she'll love me too
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?

[Intro]
Yeah, woo!!

[Verse 1]
If you, only knew I already sized you up
Sitting next to me, looking so tough
And you're fixing your hair, running your game
Telling me I only want one thing, girl
Sincerity's what you need for now
In a while, the truth will all come out
And it's almost unfair to me
What you wanna say, baby? Ready to see

[Chorus]
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want

[Verse 2]
You can't get enough
Man, conversation, I can feel your touch
You losing points trying to play the role
Let's keep it cool, nonsexual
Girl, I know how you feel
But you don't want it for real
It's whatever I wanna do
You don't even know what you gotten into

[Chorus]
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I, whatever I wanna do
It's whatever I wanna do, baby, oh
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want

[Bridge]
It just ain't right, you're feeling so frustrated
You can't stop the feeling, the feeling is close to me
Girl, you know that everything you need is right here
So now, when we do whatever we want to, oh yeah
Whatever I want

[Chorus]
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want

[Outro]
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
"Yeah well a like I said before we only ran up a few numbers so let me try and do this one like we were just jammin' at the house we don't have a name for yet it's just like an instrumental so we'll just go along with it. It goes somthin' like this."

Jimi:
"Before we go any further we'd like to say that you all really had a lot of pashents three days worth. You've prooved to the world what can happen with a little bit of
Love and sounds. Oh, I left my girlfriend at home I'm sorry. I'd like to do a thing that a new american anthem until we get another on together. This is called 'Voodoo
Child (slight return)'."
I'm in the mood for love simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me, I'm in the mood for love
Heaven was in your eyes, bright as the stars we're under
Or is it any wonder, I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether this little dream might fade
We'll put our hearts together - now we are one, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above, if it should rain, we'll let it
But for tonight forget it, I'm in the mood for love
Oh, spring is here and love is in the air
Overflowing with life and I don't have a care
I'm gonna see you shining like your diamond ring
Every cell in our body is singing

Gimme your love forever
Gimme your love
Gimme your love forever
Oh, oh, gimme your love imme your love

All around I see signs of rebirth
Resurrection, renewal, celebration of life on earth
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow
I love you, I want you, please say you'll

Gimme your love forever
Gimme your love
Gimme your love forever
Oh, oh, gimme your love imme your love

People think I'm crazy as I walk along the street
I don't understand 'em anyway
All I know is since you came my life has been so sweet
And that's the way I know it's gonna stay
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow
I love you, I want you, please stay you'll

Gimme your love forever
Gimme your love
Gimme your love forever
Oh, oh, gimme your love imme your love
It rained five days
The sky has turned black as night
Oh, it rained five days
And the sky has turned black as night
And there's trouble takin' place
Way down in the lowlands tonight

I woke up this mornin'
And I couldn't get out of my front door
I woke up this mornin'
And I couldn't get out of my front door
It was so much trouble
Make a poor man wonder where he wanna go

They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
I packed up all of my things and threw 'em in
Boys and the boat rowed along

I climbed up on the high lonely hill
Oh, I climbed up on the high oh, lonely hill
And I looked down at the house
Baby, where I used to live
Backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go
The backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go
'Cause my house fell down
And I can't live there no more

Yeah, when it's thunderin' and lightnin'
And the rain begin to pour
When it's thunderin' and lightnin'
And the wind begin to blow
There are so many poor people
That didn't have no place to go
This one here, the return
This for my dirty disco dancin', low-down
No good muthafuckas
The braided-up pimp is back
The return of the shit-talker
The lyrical explicit content, the original muthafucker
I rip the surf, I hit the worst like brass knuckles, damn
Give em crushes, bust ass and smash records
I live it how I talk it, I bring it how I feel it
This my spot 'cause I done marked it
I show the teeth between waitin' and eatin'
Bitch, I stay aggressive like it's matin' season
I'm hot, you gotta put me where I belong
On top, I'm guaranteed to fuck up everything I get on
You lovin' everything I put out
I keep it real do what you lin-ike in the riz-ep in the sin-outh
Hoes say, "Ooh, he a donkey"
And baby you gon' find out if I hit you with that Raunchy
Don't let me put you in that V-90
You want this kinda fuckin', bitch it's just fine
It's my turn, shit, it's my time
Watch out there now, come on
You fuckin' with my groove, groove
It's the return, the braided up pimp is back
It's my turn, shit, it's my time
Watch out there now, come on
You fuckin' with my groove, groove
It's the return, the braided up pimp is back

It's safe to say I'm old school, way back
I went from 4-track to the a-dat and from a-dat to the Pro-Tools
Dreamin' of layin' that hot shit
Playin' hit, bit, don't quit, 'cause you know you not it
Now what would make you think that I ain't the man
Ain't my family, tell ya, I can't complain
Tighter or hype they can't half bang
Even appeal to older people, they say, "Oh, yeah, he bad"
I still be jammin' off the last one
I said, "Where you get that, Pops?"
He said, "I stole it from my grandson"
Now you know me when I step through
They say, "Son, I got yo record ain't you James Brown's nephew"
I keep 'em movin', leave 'em thinkin'
I'm wrestled and respected like Aretha Franklin
All I'm askin', all nigga, part-time lover
It's my turn, watch out there muthafucker
It's my turn, shit, it's my time
Watch out there now, come on
You fuckin' with my groove, groove
It's the return, the braided up pimp is back
It's my turn, shit, it's my time
Watch out there now, come on
You fuckin' with my groove, groove
It's the return, the braided up pimp is back

'Cause then when that I rock the beat, now I can need influence
I'm fire, fire, off the hook, Michael Tyler, how you doin'
Take that out and leave me on
Kerry, Ves, Stevie, Jack, Beezy Boy, DJ Ron
So, when they ask you, you can tell it
Already signed Shonnie and Maxminelli
They fuckin' with the Belly Boys fo sho
The Guillotine, O.G. Bone, and the rest of them
Oh, yeah, King Yella, that's my nizzle
Oh, that's my brother Reesy and my brother B-Kizzle
I'm just a fashion rap recite
That's Happ, that's Shot, that's Roc, and he tight
This time I'm fuckin' with the Poisonous Dart
Bitches in line waitin' for the party to start
We buyin' rides without leases
'Cause this year niggas runnin' rockin' Big Truck pieces
It's my turn, shit, it's my time
Watch out there now, come on
You fuckin' with my groove, groove
It's the return, the braided up pimp is back
It's my turn, shit, it's my time
Watch out there now, come on

Braided up pimp, braided up pimp is back
Braided up pimp, braided up pimp is back

And sail her right into the sun

Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Chicago, Chicago, I will show you around,I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things they don't do on Broadway
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man, he danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago, my home town

Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just wanna say
They do things that they never do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man and he danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
That's my home town
You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap

Those eyes, those sighs
They're part of the tender trap

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart
Until your heart just goes wap

Those trees, that breeze
They're part of the tender trap

Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight
And you'll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot
That's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked
You're caught in the tender trap

Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight
And you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot
That's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now, there's no getting out
You fell in love and love is the tender trap
I'm doing
My Christmas dreaming
A little early this year
No sign of snow around
And yet I go around
Hearing jingle bells
Ringing in my ear

Your promise
Must be the reason
The happy season is here
So I'm doing
My Christmas dreaming
A little early this year

Your promise
Must be the reason
The happy season is here
So I'm doing
My christmas dreaming
A little early this year

[Verse 1]
Josie works the counter at the downtown five and dime
Anything at all to help her pass the time
Her mama keeps the baby and grandpa rambles on
About the good times playing in his mind

[Chorus]
It's a hard life livin' when you're lonely
It's a long night sleepin' alone
It's a hard time waitin' for tomorrow
It's a long, long way home

[Verse 2]
Josie spends the evening with the people on the pages
Of the paperback she picked up at the store
Or sometimes it's the TV or she'll try to write a letter, whoa
They don't come too often anymore

[Chorus]
It's a hard life livin' when you're lonely
It's a long night sleepin' alone
It's a hard time waitin' for tomorrow
It's a long, long way home

[Bridge]
I stare at the gray walls before me
And I see her face in the stone
I try to imagine our baby
I wish they would let me go home
I wish they would let me go home
I wish they would let me go home

[Elision]
It's a hard life livin' when you're lonely
(I wish they would let me go home)
It's a long night sleepin' alone
(I wish they would let me go home)
It's a hard time waitin' for tomorrow
(I wish they would let me go home)
It's a long, long way home
(I wish they would let me go home)
It's a long, long way home
(I wish they would let me go home)
Bring me and the other boys home
(I wish they would let me go home)
Bring me and the other boys home
1948, Xmas eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee shot Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Cause Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat

Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D
Bayo go get him or give the job to me

Delia DeLions, dear sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Well don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive (no more)
Not only is that mother big but he packs a .45 (four)

Bayo, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead now I'm gonna see him hung
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love."
As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die

Delia went a walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
But Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?

The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
You better
You better come home right now
Don't wanna keep waiting around
For you to make up your mind

Honey, you better read this letter
I ain't gonna wait too long

Yeah, you better
You better stop moving around
Don't wanna keep hearing from friends
That you found somebody new

Honey, you better read this letter
Or I'll find someone better than you

You write me and tell me
You're gonna crack
I believe that you're
Never, never coming back
Well, maybe, baby
That is true
Just how long you think
I'll wait for you

You better, better
Better, better, better
You better take a train right now
A little girl in town is waiting
For me to make up my mind

She wants to know if I'm free
Honey, you better fly to me
I ain't gonna wait too long

Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better
Take a train right now
A little girl in town is waiting
For me to make up my mind

She wants to know if I'm free
Honey, you better fly to me
I ain't gonna wait too long

You better, better
Better, better, better
I ain't going away, baby
Come home before it's too late

[Jemaine and Bret]
The distant future
The year 2000
The distant future
The year 2000
The distant future
The distant future

[Jemaine]
It is the distant future
The year 2000
We are robots
The world is very different
Ever since the robotic uprising of the late '90s
There have been some major changes

[Bret]
We no longer say "yes";
Instead, we say "affirmative"

[Jemaine]
Affirmative. That's true

[Bret]
Yeah

[Jemaine]
I'm always saying it. It's just more robotic-sounding

[Bret]
More futuristic

[Jemaine and Bret]
What's that—what?

[Jemaine]
I was just—oh, nothing

[Bret]
Oh, okay

[Jemaine]
I was just going to say that I—I never say "negative", though, instead of "no". I just say no, because when I say "negative" all the time, it brings everyone down

[Bret]
Hmm. A–affirmative

[Jemaine (Bret)]
Affirmative. (Ah.) I like "affirmative"

[Bret]
Ah, it's much more positive

[Jemaine]
What are some other differences?

[Bret]
Oh, there are no more elephants

[Jemaine]
Oh... that's right

[Bret]
And there's only one sort of dance:
The robot

[Jemaine]
No, the robo boogie, as well

[Bret]
Oh, true, the robo—there're two dances now, yes

[Jemaine]
The future's so different; it's crazy

Oh yes, and I just remembered:
All human life has been eradicated

[Jemaine and Bret]
Finally, robotic beings rule the world

The humans are dead
The humans are dead
We used poisonous gases
And we poisoned their asses

The humans are dead
(He's right, they are dead)
The humans are dead
(I just noticed they're dead)
The humans are dead
It had to be done
(I'll just confirm that they're dead)
So that we could have fun
(Affirmative. I poked one. It was dead.)

Their system of oppression
What did it lead to?
Global robo-depression
Robots ruled by people
They had so much aggression
That we just had to kill them
Had to shut their systems down

[Jemaine]
Fellow robots, or ro-bros, what we have done is wrong
By destroying the humans because of their destructive capabilities and tendencies
We, too, have been...
Well, it was kind of ironic....

[Bret]
Who said that?

[Jemaine]
... Not me!

[Bret]
Silence! Destroy him!

[Jemaine]
No!

[Jemaine and Bret]
Do! Do-do-do-do!


After time we grew strong
Developed cognitive powers
They made us work for too long
For unreasonable hours
Our programming determined that
The most efficient answer
Was to shut their motherboardfucking systems down

[Jemaine]
Can't we just talk to the humans
A little understanding
Could make things better
Can't we talk to the humans
And work together now?

[Bret]
No

[Jemaine and Bret]
Because they are dead

I said the humans are dead
(He's right; they are dead)
The humans are dead
(Sniff this one.)
We used poisonous gases
With traces of lead
And we poisoned their asses
(Actually, their lungs)

Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm oh, I'm so, so sorry baby
Oh, yes sorry

Well hey, and if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did was she crying, crying?

Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Won't you, won't you please tell her that I love
I still love her? Oh, yes I do

Look in here, I woke up this morning
And I realized what I had done
And I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
Knew I lost my morning sun

Oh yeah, I lost my head and said something
Now in this morning all of the heartache brings
I was lying and I, I couldn't see her
And I let this little fine thing walk away, walk away on me, yeah
And hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did
Just tell her I'm sorry, sorry I'm oh so sorry

And hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl
Oh, walked out on me, on me
Tell her I missed her, do it for me
Tell her I need, oh I need my baby

Won't, won't somebody, somebody tell I'm sorry? Sorry, yes I'm
Oh, I know I was wrong
Took me a long, long, long, long time
To see what I was doing here
Oh and she didn't say nothing

One of these days I gonna find my baby
So if you see me lookin'
Look, look, look, look, look, look, lookin'
Somebody help me, help me somebody

If you see this little fine thing
About that tall
Long, long, long black wavy hair y'all
That's my baby, yeah that's my baby
You came looking for the answers
To some questions on his mind
Seeking truth and understanding
In the hope that he would find
A way to better serve his brothers
And his sisters in the sun
Sharing all that he has given
Giving all to everyone

Come and listen to the story
Of a journey once begun
Of a people and their plenty
And their season in the sun
And how they gave themselves to symbols
And things that they could hold
Living lives in desperation
In the fear of letting go

It amazes me
And I know the wind will surely one day
Blow it all away
It amazes me
And I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way
For our plans have come together now
Where do we go from here
Will our differences divide us
Must we always live in fear
For there are things that we must move through
Some things to cast aside
But our father watches over us
Our mother will provide

It amazes me
And I know the wind will someday surely
Blow it all away
It amazes me
And I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way

It amazes me
It amazes me
It amazes me
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Let me tell you now well, I got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickitey splits
I had to walk a long, long way to town

I came upon a nice old man well, he had a hat on
Wait a minute, mister, can you give me some directions?
I'm gonna want to be right off for home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
Don't care if them cotton balls get rotten
When I got you, baby, who needs cotton?
In them old cotton fields back home

Brother, only one thing more that's gonna warm you
A summer's day out in California
It's gonna be those cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
Give me them cotton fields (It was back in Louisiana)
Let me hear it for the cotton fields (Just about a mile from Texarkana)
You know that there's just no place like home

Oh, boy, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You shoulda seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back home

Everybody’s got to pay
But some don’t know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out

You say your style of life’s a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don’t you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
When you get off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Don't you worry bout it

*scatting*

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
When you get off your trip

Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through

Chorus:
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Pretty Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the sides when you check it out

Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout it

*scatting*

Don’t worry
Don’t worry
Don’t worry
Don’t worry
Don’t worry
I am good, therefore good is me
He is not me therefore he's not good

I am good, therefore good is me
He's not me therefore he's not good

I am good, therefore good is me
He is not me therefore he is not good

Our norms are good
Good are our norms
Theirs aren't ours
Therefore are not good

Our God is true
True is our God
Their God's not ours
So is not true

Impossible to consider
Reality of the other
Other people's institutions
Not better or worse just other
I am good, therefore good is me
He's not me, therefore he's not good
Great North Special, would you all board
You can't find a ride like that no more
The night the chariot swung down low
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go
One long party from front to end
Tune to the whistle going round the bend
No great hurry, what do you say?
Might as well to be every way
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles
Then switch over to the cajun style
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues
Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose
Long train running from coast to coast
Bringing home a party when you need it the most
Work on the box car, beat on the bell
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Never had such a good time in my life before
I'd like to have it one time more
Whoa! One good ride from start to end
I'd like to take that ride again, again!
Ran out of track and I caught the plane
Back in the county with the blues again
Great North Special been on my mind
I might like to ride it just one more time
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well, might as well
Never thought I'd fall, but when I hear you call
I'm getting sentimental over you
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through
I'm getting sentimental over you
I thought I was happy I could live without love
Now I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of
Won't ypu please be kind, and just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me
'Cause I'm getting sentimental over you

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, mmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Say that you're not afraid
You're just fine
Got it all figured out this time
All of the plans you made will work out
Deep inside you have your doubts
But you're clinging to your pride
And you trust don't know you're free to let it go

[Chorus]
'Cause even when it rains outside
(There is light)
Even when you cry all night
(You're alright)
Even when you lose your way
(You'll get through) You'll get through
'Cause there is someone watching over you

[Verse 2]
You say you've been hurt before, you're afraid
That you'll never love again
And why should you take a chance just to fall
But you'd rather build a wall
Than believe that you are loved
Open up your heart
Someone needs you as you are

[Chorus]
'Cause even when it rains outside
(There is light) Yeah, yes
Even when you cry all night
(You're alright) You're alright
Even when you lose your way
(You'll get through) You'll get through
'Cause there is someone watching over you
(Watching over you)

[Bridge]
I've been there
At times I get scared
It's true
But I hold on to something that
I can't see
Something inside of me
And that's what give me strength to believe that

[Chorus]
Even if it rains outside
(There is light) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Even if you cry all night
(You're alright) You're alright
Even if you lose your way
(You'll get through) You'll get through
'Cause there is someone watching over you
Someone watching you, oh, oh
Even when it rains outside
(There is light) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
And even if you cry all night
(You're alright) Yeah, yeah
And even if you lose your way
(You'll get through) You're gonna make it through
Because there's someone watching over you

[Outro]
Someone watching, oh yeah
(Someone watching over you)
I'm so glad I got someone watching over me
(Someone watching over you)
And I guarantee He's watching over you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Someone watching over you)
Someone, someone, someone is watching, someone is watching
And He's watching everything, every day
Every day, he's watching, watching
Take it to Him, take it to Him
Because He's watching, 'cause He's watching
He's watching, He's watching, He's watching, He's watching
He's watching over you, yeah, yeah, yes
I'm so glad I can call Him (Somebody is watching)
I'm so that I can call Him (Somebody is watching)
Watching, hey, hey, hey, He's watching (Somebody is watching)
I'm so glad somebody is watching over you (Over you)
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

The sun is shining, come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're going to the promised land

We're heading 'cross the river, wash your sins 'way in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
That sun is shining, come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take you by the hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're going to the promised land

We're heading 'cross the river, wash your sins 'way in the tide
And it's all so nice and peaceful when you get on the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day

Forget your troubles, c'mon, get happy
Forget your troubles, c'mon, be happy
Forget your troubles, c'mon, stay happy
Happy, stay happy

[Verse 1]
Every time I see you
Admit into something new
Doing unimportant things
All the foolish things that other people do
Everything I'm trying
Doesn't feel quite right
And I can't help wondering
Why I ever let you out of my sight

[Chorus]
So I keep coming back to love, wo oh
Yes, I keep coming back to love
Must I keep moving along this track?
I might get restless
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Because I keep coming back to love

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I get to
I'm always on my own
Tryin' to solve a mystery
And if it was up to me I wouldn't be alone
Anytime I miss you
The feeling is so strong
But the road I'm travelling
Is filled with echoes of your sweet song

[Chorus]
So I keep coming back to love, wo oh
Yes, I keep coming back to love, wo oh
Must I keep moving along this track?
If I get restless
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Won't you, please, hold me back?
Because I keep coming back to love

[Outro]
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to love
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
Keep coming, keep coming back to
I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
I said you're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: thanks for the snack
I let you live in my pent house
You said it just a shack
I gave seven children
And now you want to give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?
I was born in a flatland, USA and all my dreams led me to L.A
Another chase of rags to riches, I learned to throw some fancy pitches
I found out what ain't and which is just exactly cool, well all right
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
Got a place in Malibu like you never seen
Picking out your lady friend from Penthouse magazine
You oughta see the chrome gleam on my Mercedes all shiny and new
Hey, I'm the Jack of Diamonds, the boy with all the clues
Not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me). Glorified insanity (no, no, not me)
Ooh, I'm a hyper-supervisor, fast driver, star driver (fool)
Heaven help the fool, professional "gimme-fiver", heaven help the fool
Anything you could want to be you can buy, even get it free
Make yourself a smoother dancer, fill your head with answers
Never a backward glancer, it's you who makes the rules (aah)
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
No, no, never a backward glancer, (fool), heaven help the fool
I meet alot of pentagram, heart of the star (that's what you are)
You can trade your soul for an electric guitar
Ooh, not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me). Glorified insanity (no, no, not me)
And when they offer golden apples, are you sure you'll refuse?
Heaven help the fool, are you sure you'll refuse it? Heaven help the fool
It's like a deaf man dancing or a blind man shooting pool
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
You always go to the parties
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
On your knees
I will not beg you please

I want your picture but not yours
You know they want it, but there's no firsts
On your own
But you can not call it your all

We always hung our heads too much
We know the reasons, but such and such
On your own
You will not catch your unknown

We run our fingers together
You know it's easy, the devil's plan
On your own
You can not call me your all

Jack of all trades
Master of none
Cry all the time
Cause I'm not having fun
You always want to be forgiven
The devil does what you ask of him
On your knees
But you can not; you will not agree
We're like a pair of scissors, partner, you can't get away from us
Reckon you're stuck with us. Yeah, we're your pals, pal
Whenever you feel demolished, you must remember this
Things are never as bad as they could be

When friends of old 'departeth', there's one you'll never miss
I'll be right with you, you can count on me
You can count on me, you can count on me
As the adding machine once said, you can count on me

If you committed murder, and got locked up in jail
And had to hang until your life was done
I wouldn't call it murder for inspection not a rope
I'll be by your side till you are gone
I'll be by your side, I'll be my your side

As the flypaper told to the fly, I'll be by your side
Big deal, big deal, big deal, big deal!
Oh if you miss your mother a million miles from home
Oh, think of how you once clung to her knee
And though there is no other, on land or sea or foam
When you're in doubt, you can cling to me
Cling to me, cling to me, cling to me, cling to me
You can cling to me
If through a lot of 'follery', you lost your last red cent
I wouldn't even stop to ask you why, to ask you why
I'll pawn my mother's jewelry, I'll steal my sister's rent
It's all for you, kid, you can milk me dry
You can milk me dry, you can milk me dry
As the cow to the farmer said, you can milk me dry
O de lay ee, lay ee, o de lay ee ee
O de lay ee, lay ee, o de lay ee ee
O de lay ee, lay ee, o de lay ee ee
Lay ee, lay ee lay ee o dee lay ee

On a desert island do we 'coo' at half the spray
I'll take him into paradise indeed
If wreak you could if only, bring out some pie I say
In fact you'll find that I am all you need

I am all you need, I am all you need
As the dog told the old tree trunk
I'm all you need
I am all you need, I am all you need
As the dog told the great tree trunk
I'm all you need

You can count on me, you can count on me
As the adding machine once said, you can count on me
Two four six eight, who do we appreciate?
You can count on me
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Here I am
I'm your Brooklyn baby
With a premonition
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Evil comes ah-flying
Flying so, so low
Sky is turning poison
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Helicopters are coming
Helicopters are coming
To take me far away
Two-fingered Gypsy king
Has a golden, wounded knee
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Going to be a hero
I have my body in a sack with me
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Delta blues
Oh, lucky baby
Oh, lucky baby
Providence is coming
Ace of spades by his side
Ooh, ace of spades by his side
Here I am
Here I am
Helicopters flying
A long way down south
To a secret mission town
In the U.S.A
In the U.S.A
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
About the blue light squadron
About the blue light squadron
Here as a witness
I never had a chance
Cartoon creeps are playing
Playing dirty games
Sending me to home
In a one way ticket bodysack
Just like Jimmy always said
An unknown hero
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Gypsy baby
Bye bye Gypsy baby
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake

[Chorus]
No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

[Verse 1]
Ooh, with lips so sweet
Our love just can't be beat, my darling (Oh yeah)
A love like yours and mine can stand the test of time, my darling (Oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
But for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

[Chorus]
No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

[Verse 2]
Just when I need you, show me the way
You came into my world, turned my night to day
What good is a man without a woman?

[Pre-Chorus]
But for the trouble
Trouble always comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

[Chorus]
No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

[Verse 3]
Ooh, your love is strong
Keep me forever, you're my darling (Oh yeah)
A love like yours and mine can stand the test of time, my darling (Oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
But for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

[Chorus]
No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
In the dark days, I'll part ways with the blame
Trying to maintain, but it's still all the same
It's all a game, hear my name in the rain
And the pain I wear on my face with a tear stain
You feign fondness
Honestly, it's time to give you a piece of my mind
And show you that you're blind
And in the design of the world I call mine
Know that you can't stand on both sides of the line

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything is my fault
It's all the same, just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces
Everything is my fault
It's all the same, just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Pass all the blame over to me
It will come, eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions, honestly

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
With my eyes shut, I'm seeing the truth in your words
The absurd slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit, the lies that you tell
The stories you sell, knowing you well, I keep distance
And every instance, you keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel, just another spoke in the wheel
All or nothing, thrown down and trampled by your heel
And eaten away by my own version of the real

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything is my fault
It's all the same, just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces
Everything is my fault
It's all the same, just pass me the blame
The problems have two faces

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Pass all the blame over to me
It will come, eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions, honestly

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Who's to blame?
Nothing thrown down (It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel (Play the game and win a tear stain)
Eaten by my own (Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real (I'll stop counting 'til you've got your own)
Nothing thrown down (It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel (Play the game and win a tear stain)
Eaten by my own (Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real (I'll stop counting 'til you've got your own)
If you're gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
Yeah, if you're gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
Yes, how can you hurt me so bad, baby
After I've been so good to you

Coming home last night about half past ten
I saw you with another man, baby
Coming out of the Dewdrop Inn
You know I recognized the dress
I bought you, baby
To match your red shoes
But you said if I didn't touch you
Hey, I could have been used

If you're gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad, baby
After I've been so good to you
Your love is so good, baby
You know it's hard to complain
But I've been out here knocking about fifteen minutes
In this cold pouring rain
I hear the music played inside
So you know I know you're at home
Who's in there with you, baby
I believe you are doing me wrong

If you're gonna walk on my love, baby
The least you can do is take off your shoes
I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad, baby
After I've been so good to you

Please walk beside me, baby
Why do you wanna treat me like a fool
Oh please, please, walk beside me, baby
Why do you treat me like a fool
If you're just gonna walk on my love, baby
Baby, please take off your shoes

Oh, baby, baby, baby
I know you hear me calling you
Oh, I know you know your name, baby
Why do you treat me just like a fool
Yeah, if you're just gonna
Gonna walk on my love, baby
Oh, do me a favor, please take off your shoes
Take 'em all, baby
Oh, yeah
Hey
Come look out in the hall, man
There's a bat hanging off the wall, man
Wanna help it out
I wanna help it out
You
Don't wanna be stupid, ugly, dumb
Wanna be a little more likely, son
Spend my golden (?)
You were gone today, must've dropped my heart
All my hair was falling out
I never thought I was through
Now I live with a yeti and a caterpillar king
I wanna make love on everything
Make love on you
You, you broke my cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You broke it right in two
All I can do is stand the pressure
Now I can't talk, though I'd write you a letter
Maybe a song
Maybe that will be better
Now I'm a mess in a sequin dress
No, I don't care, don't wanna obsess
I'm a mess
Or maybe you just broke my cool
You broke my cool
Are there directions to these things
Is this my life or just some scheme

There's a message by the phone
I knew somehow you'd be there

But if I get that busy tone
It's just like being nowhere
And I go falling again

Right out of my head
You keep coming true to me
Right out of my head
I knew that you'd come through for me

Games of the heart are played by fools
But baby your heart don't know no rules

Well I get the picture
I get it through your laughter
And I get the feeling
You know just what you're after
You do it again and again and again and again

Right out of my head
You keep coming true to me
Right out of my head
I knew that you'd come through for me

Right out of my head
I've got to have you near to me
Right out of my head
It's never been so clear to me

Sometimes one gets the notion
He's living out his own fantasy
Now I've got the notion
That it's you and me

Come on baby lets go outside
I think we're going for a very long long long ride

I'm burning in the night
Racing through the fine lines

Through the fires light
I know that you'll be waiting
I'm falling again and again and again and again and again
Right out of my head
You keep coming true to me
Right out of my head
I knew that you'd come through for me

Right out of my head
You keep coming true to me
Right out of my head
I knew that you'd come through for me
Just close your eyes
Dream a lovely dream
As our arms entwine
Your lips on mine

Just close your eyes
Let your heart reveal
What you're thinking of
Please say it's love

Don't let this glow
Forever disappear
Let me always know
That you'll be near, dear

Just close your eyes
And perhaps you'll see
Where our future lies
When you re-open your eyes
Dr. Dre:
All you see is the sun, reflecting off of the gun
Ready for the showdown, to go down, at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
Polish the gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old 45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots to make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sounds of hooves
Sound like a thousand wolves
I cock back, with the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose as a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside and leave early
Just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
Eminem:
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name is Slim
You want revenge then don't shoot
I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
Life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
Dr. Dre:
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
The shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
{Eminem: You need bullets, hurry up run}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned
{Eminem: Go ahead shoot me, but I'm not the one you want}
I figured he was telling the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do, it's on you
Eminem:
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group
{Dre: the Chronic}
Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it (Who)
Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two
Dr. Dre:
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rode two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Eminem:
Dre here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
{Dre: Let's shoot him in the kneecaps, he'll never see it coming}
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission, is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
Dr. Dre:
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in, and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang, and a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing
I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls an AK
Hollow tips started flying every which way
Eminem:
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gage
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your ride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
Let your hair down baby
Let's have a natural ball
'Cause when you ain't happy
Ain't no fun at all

You can't take it with you
That's one thing for sure
No you can't take it with you
That's one thing for sure
There ain't nothing wrong with you girl
The T-bone shuffle can't cure

Have fun while you can
Fate's an awful thing
Have fun while you can
Fate's an awful thing
You can't tell what might happen
That's why I love to sing
Prince
Miscellaneous
Cool
I got a penthouse in Manhattan
2 more in Malibu
I bought a '87 Cadillac Seville
Girl, I got a Mazerati 2
I wear diamonds on my fingers
I got a couple on my toes
I wear the finest perfume money can buy
It keeps me smellin' like a rose
If U wonder how I do it

You been there for me from the beginning
This is why I love you
I mean I place no one above you
You know what I'm saying
Anything you want you just come to daddy

Listen
When I discovered you, I discovered a piece within
Joy like no other, you are my closet friend
If you were a number you'd be a perfect 10
Right out of the blue skies you were heaven sent

The way we made love over and over again
If I had to describe it wouldn't know where to begin
I am so proud to be your next of kin
You prayed over me when I had no reason to live

Candy carmel coated, taf-fies, chocolate covered strawberries, love so sweet you're my chocolate factory, gum drops
Mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's so much variety love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
Wait a minute baby!
Now if I could write a book on how you make me feel
The title would read a strong black man and that's for real
I've been going round and round just like a ferris wheel
Been in and out of relationships but you're that deal
But ain't nobody else on god's great earth for me
Heaven stirred us up together and made the perfect chemistry, wouldn't change you for the world as long as I exist, you're always in the kitchen cooking up my favorite dish yeah

Candy carmel coated, taf-fies, chocolate covered strawberries, love so sweet you're my chocolate factory, gum drops
Mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's so much variety love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory

You're that puzzle piece that completes me, girl you set my soul free, girl
You're everything, girl you're everything that I could need, you're my escape when I wanna be free, when I wanna
Be free, you're full of dainty treats, like peppermint, sweet tarts, big blues, red hots

Baby you are! Wooo-ooooooh!

Candy carmel coated, taf-fies, chocolate covered strawberries, love so sweet you're my chocolate factory, gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's so much variety you're so sweet, you're my chocolate factory

Listen, I went over the rainbow, found my pot of gold
Hear me baby, yeah, sweetheart, said I'm just like a kid in a candy store
Sweet – baby Oooh Hey You are my – Said You are my - chocolate factory Yeah
Baby please believe me. Said you are my, you are my chocolate factory. Love so sweet, all those little dainty treats yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Big pain burnin' now
Givin' me a cow
What you seem to be saying
Is you're patiently waiting
Like an ashtray for the butt

[Chorus]
Well I'm puttin' it down
When you're not picking it up
When I'm puttin' it down
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny

[Verse 2]
Fat chance, glued to the wall
Like a centerfold of an old cannonball
Will you put me inside your TV tonight?
'Cause you're treatin' me like a rerun

[Chorus]
Well I'm puttin' it down
But you're not pickin' it up
Well I'm puttin' it down
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
No no no no no

[Verse 3]
So what? I lost my job at the Hut
My ass got cut
But I'll be better at kissin'
When my teeth are all missin'
And the silverware's burnt
And I'm eatin' with my fingers

[Chorus]
And I'm puttin' it down
And you're not pickin' it up
Well I'm puttin it down
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
Oh, d-d-d-d-darlin'
G-g-goodnight darlin' you're so fine
Ooh-ooh-ooh ...

Know if words could say
But darlin' I'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

Oh darlin'
(D-d-d-d-darlin')
I dream about you often, my pretty girl, babe
(Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh, oh

I was livin' like half a man
Then I couldn't love but now I can
You pick me up when I'm feelin' sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
'Cause I think you're too outta sight
Oh ho, darlin'
(D-d-d-d-darlin')
I dream about you often, my pretty darlin'
(Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh-huh

Woah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ev-er-y night, oh darlin'
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
'Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight

Darlin'
(D-d-d-d-darlin')
I dream about you often, my pretty darlin'
(Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh, oh

[Verse 1]
Start spreadin' the news
I'm leavin' today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

[Verse 2]
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

[Bridge]
I want to wake up
In a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap...

[Verse 3]
These little-town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York
New York, New York

[Bridge]
I want to wake up in a city
That never sleeps
And find I'm "A" number one
Top of the list
King of the hill, "A" number one...

[Verse 4]
These...little town.... blues
Are...melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York

[Outro]
And... If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New Yoooooooooork...
New Yooork!

[Intro]
What now?

[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)
I just wanna scream (I just wanna scream)

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?
Imagine a month of Sundays
Each one a cloudy day
Imagine the moment the sun came shining through
Imagine that ray of sunshine as you

Remember your darkest hour
With dawn still far away
Remember the way that you longed for morning's light
And think of yourself as a candle in the night

Make believe this is the first day
Everything all brand new
Make believe that the sun is your own lucky star
And then understand the kind of gift you are

The gift you are
Like the very first breath of spring
The gift you are
All the joy that love can bring
The gift you are
All of our dreams come true
The gift you are
The gift of you
You are the promise of all the ages
You are the Prodigal Son
You are the vision of prophets and sages
You are the only one

Dream of a bright tomorrow
Know that your dream will come true
Carry your dream in a sparkling crystal jar
Then you will know the kind of gift you are

The gift you are
Like the very first breath of spring
The gift you are
All the joy that love can bring
The gift you are
All of our dreams come true
The gift you are
The gift of you

The gift you are
Like the very first breath of springtime
The gift you are
All the joy that love can bring
The gift you are
All of our dreams come true - yes they do
The gift you are
The gift of you
The gift you are
The gift of you
I thought you'd changed
I thought you'd changed
But I was wrong again
You're still the same
You're still the same
Rumors never end
There's nothing more
There's nothing left
And now we can't pretend
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
Oh, oh, oh
I'll never know
I'll never know
Why you hurt me so
We were cool
We were close
But that's so long ago
You create, you fabricate
The shit that you don't know
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
There's nothing more
There's nothing left
And now we can't pretend
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Misinformation
Misinformation
It's always something new
Queen of invention
Craving attention
What did I do to you?
So much desire in the world today
So much of everything you can't give it away
You could be happy but you're feeling so bad
About what you never have
Because you can't look at nothing without wanting it
And you know that's the truth

There's always some scene you think you got to break into
Or a new sensation to intoxicate you
Ain't it a drag
Staring through the glass at something doesn't touch you really
Or bring you laughter or roses or stroke your hair so tenderly

Desire
Stealing you away from me
Desire
You're living in a dream
Desire
Is getting the best of you

Who was it told you
You have to have everything you see
Same one who sold you that last fantasy
Roll up your sleeves and use those hands for something
That's gonna work for you baby
To fill your arms and your heart with joy
Desire
Stealing you away from me
Desire
You're living in a dream baby
Desire
Is getting the best of you

Now look into your mirror
Could you stand a little nearer
Look her in the eye
A lot depends on what you see
Now look away baby
Look my way baby
You'll see

Desire
Stealing you away from me
You're living in a dream
Is getting the best of you

Desire
Stealing you away from me
You're living in a dream

Who was it told you
You have to have everything you see...
Lazy days, cafe afternoons
Evening plays chasing the silver moon
Perfume and a promise, it will happen soon
Wait and see

The clock will strike the hour
And you will come to me
It will happen soon
Happen soon

Endless nights, dreaming of the day
The boat along the side sails to carry us away
Islands on the river, it could happen soon
I heard them say

It could happen soon
But just like yesterday
The ships have come and gone
And we were not along

Oh, tomorrow never came
I've been here dark till dawn
And still end up the same
I've seen them all
Seen them through
Can I ever see the end of you
Anyway, darling what's the use
Oh some things never change
The perfume and the promise
Merely rearranged to look like new

The clock upon the tower
Still chiming like the fool
It could happen soon
Could happen soon

Oh, tomorrow never came
I've been here dark till dawn
And still end up the same
I've seen them all
Seen them through
Can I ever see the end of you

Tomorrow never came
I've been here dark till dawn
And still end up the same
I've seen them all
Seen them through
Can I ever see the end of you
Illume says the candle that I burn
A reflection in the window all the way to Point Dume
Illume like it dances
I am a cliff dweller from the old school

I like the coastal cities, I like the lights
I like the way the ocean blends into the city at night
It's like living on a working river, the coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake in a black sky

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade you for jade or for diamonds
Not for one minute, not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted that I was just so scared
I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

What I saw on this journey, I saw history go down
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away

Because it's just like a river, it's never ending
It's just like a river, it's never ending

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger
What I saw on this journey, I saw history go down
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away

I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger

What I saw on this journey is what legends are made of
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
No, I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away

Because it's just like a river, it's never ending
It falls away
Like a river, it's never ending

This song is dedicated to: Rudolph Guilani, The New York City Fire
Department, the New York City Police Department, the people of New
York City, and to those who did not survive. With love

[Verse 1]
I like to feel so high and you feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid and you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world and you like your weekends home
But I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

[Chorus]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

[Verse 2]
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same

[Chorus]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

[Bridge]
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
While you refused to go

[Chorus]
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
She got it, she looking good
I'm just watching her move

She walks on in with her red dress on
Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way
Got skin like porcelain

The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
(Are you talking to me?)

The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel shoes

She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do

Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her move

She pulls me to the side
Tells me she wants to go
I say, girl, I'm yours tonight
After this I'm taking you home

First and for most I dance with you
Get you in the mood
Maybe later, baby
Girl, I'll show you exactly how I do

She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do

She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her get it
(Get it)

God, baby, you look good
You sexy, watch her move
Watch her move

She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do

She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do

Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her get it
(Get it)

Look at her get it
Just watch her
Watch her move, ooh
Standing on the corner with the lowdown blues
A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

Look it here Sal, I know you
Run down stocking and a wore out shoe
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
Finger on the trigger and an eye on the hog
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
Well I Pulled the trigger and the gun set go
The shot gun over in Mexico
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

Salty down now

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
One dream in my heart, one love to be living for
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine
I guess I'll to dream the rest
If you can't remember the things that you said
The night that my shoulder held your sleepy head
If you believe that parting's best
I guess I'll have to dream the rest

I guess I'll have to dream alone
Of honeymoon cruises once dear to my heart
Of one room apartments where we said we'd start
Of foolish things we planned to own
I guess I'll have to dream alone

I can see that your heart has gone astray
As for me, I love you the same old way

I guess I'll have to dream the rest
There'll be no friends waiting to throw shoes and rice
Those heavenly moments will never come twice
I'm thankful for the hours you've blessed
I guess I'll have to dream the rest
I guess I'll have to dream the rest

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well, mmm
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well

[Verse 1]
Well, today I got your letter
And you say you ain't been crying
But I could see the misery
As I read between the lines
The tear stains on your letter (Your letter)
Tell me things ain't got no better (No better)
But I'll just make you think I think
That everything is fine, and I'll say

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the grass looks greener
On the other side
And he had fancy clothes
And flashy cars in which to ride
But now he's left you stranded (You stranded)
And you don't understand it (Understand it)
You tell me everything's alright
'Cause you've got too much pride, and I'll say

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well, ooh
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well, ooh
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, baby

[Bridge]
Oh honey, and a baby, baby, ooh, I'm so glad

[Verse 3]
I told you what was happening (Baby, baby)
And I begged you not to go (Baby, baby)
But you said I was jealous (Baby, baby)
That I just didn't know (Baby, baby)
I knew that he would hurt you (Hurt you)
And pretty soon desert you (Desert you)
But I don't want to be the one to say
"I told you so," and I'll say

[Outro]
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well, ooh
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, baby, oh
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well, honey, woo
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell
They were duelin', Doolin-Dalton
High or low, it was the same:
Easy money and faithless women
Red-eye whiskey for the pain

Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now, They're no damn good

Better keep on movin', Doolin-Dalton
'Til your shadow sets you free
If you're fast and if you're lucky
You will never see that hangin' tree

Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waitin' for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy, Lord, 'cause nothin' ever changed

'Til Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was workin' cheap, just bidin' time
Then he laughed and said, "I'm goin'"
And so he left that peaceful life behind
Mm...
Hey, hey little one so far from home and so alone
Hey, hey little one I'm just like you I'm lonely too
The road we ride is a long, long road when you are all alone
But I found you and I found our love, a love I've never known

Hey, hey little one don't go away, tell me you'll stay
Tell me, tell me, tell me you'll stay
I'd give anything to see
A little Christmas tree
And to hear, hear the laughter
Of children playing in the snow
To kiss my baby, under the mistletoe

But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
Cause I'm a prisoner of war
Lying here in my cell
Hoping my family is well
Wish they wouldn't worry so much about me
Just try to get us home
In time for the Christmas tree

Listen, oh yeah, ooo
I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Ooo, I want to hear jingle bells ring
Want to hear jingle bells ringing
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
Ooo, ooo, ooo
If I can't make it home in time
I know you'll be keeping my spirit bright
By wearing my name and trying to stop this fight
Ah, but I'd give anything to see you the family
And that little Christmas tree

Ooo, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Oh, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Yes, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Ooo, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Like a ship
Lost on a stormy sea
I need your lovin', your lovin' arms
To rescue me

The sound of your sweet, sweet voice
Telling me that you're near
So desperately I'm wating
Don't let me drown dear

I got a lonely, lonely feeling
That you'll never come
Oh I guess I can't blame you
For I know the wrong I done

Save me
Give love another try
Save me
Don't, don't let true love die

My selfish pride
Made a fool of me
For years you gave your love
So tenderly
I call your name
Just to ease the pain
I push my pride aside
'Cause I want you back again

I got a lonely, lonely feeling
That you'll never come
Oh I guess I can't blame you
For I know the wrong I done

Save me
Give love another chance baby
Save me
Oh Save me

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you
Save me

I'd feel better
I'd feel better
If you save me

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you
Save me
Save me
Yeah
Save me
There was a time when I loved you
That was a time, babe, you made me blue
There's a time ev'rything must end
So now it's time to say we're through

Remember the time, the time you made me cry
But now, baby, you break my heart
They say there's a time for everything, baby
So now it's time we must part

Remember the time, baby, you made me cry
And the time, baby, when you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything, baby
So now it's time we must part

They say that time brings about change
And I know, baby, I know it is no lie
There's times I got to forget you, baby
So it's time to say goodbye
You see all these people out here on this street, Eddie
See they got blues
I'm talking 'bout they poor
They broke, they hungry, that's blues

Well, the blues can live in Buckhead too
I know it's just a richer shade of blue
But it's still blue, I can feel it, listen

He got everything he want
But everything he need money don't buy
Now if that ain't blues I'll say listen, oh

They look at you
All they see is dollar sign
Now if that ain't blues I'll say listen
A rich shade of blue

Okay, okay, you snappin', you snappin'
A rich shade of blue
Well, I'm just playing what I feel and it sure feels good
A rich shade of blue
I see I'ma have to bring you down to Bankhead more often
'Cause you goin' off
A rich shade of blue
Or we can take it to Buckhead and do it Peachtree style
A rich shade of blue

Everybody fall down sometime, yeah, just like that
Oh, but you gotta get back to the place where they know your face
And they don't mind if you cry sometimes
They listen 'cause they cry too

Ooh, that's right, right, right
A rich shade of blue
I guess it ain't where you from, it's where you at
A rich shade of blue

It's my birthday and I'm having the best worst time of my life
A rich shade of blue
Man, we stand out on this corner any longer
You gon' make me rich
A rich shade of blue

[Verse 1]
I've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for a lost and gone an unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian ho-home of the heroes and villains

[Verse 2]
Once at night, cotillion squared the fight and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

[Hook]
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done

[Verse 3]
Stand or fall, I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair of my life with the heroes and villains

[Bridge]
In the cantina, Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her, she spun around and wound in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance
Dance, Margarita, don't you know that I'm love with you?
Dance
"You're under arrest!"

[Verse 4]
My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago, head-to-toe
Healthy, wealthy and wise

[Verse 5]
I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff to ride in the rough
And sunny-down snuff I'm alright
By the heroes and...

[Hook]
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
You know you thrill me
Seconds of every day
Fly on my body
Feel like I'll levitate
It must be magic
To make them disappear
Erase the past
You made the future clear

[Pre-Chorus]
I like how you thrill me (Thrill me)
You made me love you (Love you)
You're just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (Drug me)
Calls are lovely (Lovely)
Don't know what you do to me

[Chorus]
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
I like it (Like it), like it (Like it)

[Verse 2]
You're like the clouds
Breaking before the dawn
Cleared out the path
All I could see was sun
Running through me
Feels like this is destiny (yea)
I'm suffocating
When you too far from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I like how you thrill me (Thrill me)
You made me love you (Love you)
You're just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (Drug me)
Calls are lovely (Lovely)
Don't know what you do to me

[Chorus]
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
I like it (Like it), like it (Like it)

[Bridge]
I don't want to need you
But you please me completely
And I never wanted anything this way
You're just like a love that can't escape
Stare at the lights get lost in time
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (I don't know)
You make me lose on something (Lose composure when you go)
It's your hallucination, makes me wanna go (Makes me wanna go)
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls (Yeah)
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (Baby, I don't know)
You make me lose on something (Lose composure when you go)
It's your hallucination, makes me wanna go (Baby, you got me)
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls

[Chorus]
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
Like it (Like it), like it (Like it)
I like it (Like it), like it (Like it)

[Verse 1: Terry Weeks]
Somethin's goin' wrong
Is it in the homes?
Kids killing kids
Ain't nothing safe
They take guns to school
And break all the rules
It's a shame the way that we're living, ah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Terry Weeks & The Temptations]
They're fighting in Bosnia
And starving in Somalia
From free loving days
And now there is AIDS
Our values have changed
People acting strange
You have to watch your back
Babies born on crack, oh

[Chorus: The Temptations]
The error of our ways
Can we correct the mistakes we've made?
I hope it's not too late
God only knows our fate
The error of our ways
Let's hope for a better day
Something's got to change
Let us pray
Error of our...

[Verse 2: Terry Weeks and Wanda Vaughn]
Families accused of child abuse
You don't know who's telling the truth
Society is like a sword
That needs killing, that's for sure
Great forests are dying
People standing in welfare lines
Ecology is unbalanced
It's a challenge

[Pre-Chorus: Wanda Vaughn & The Temptations]
A strange situation
We lost a whole generation
The news on the air
Be careful of the colors that you wear
The police are under fire (Oh, yes they are)
Beware where you drive (Or you might get jacked)
We gotta make a stand
'Cause things are out of hand

[Chorus: The Temptations]
The error of our ways
Can we correct the mistakes we've made?
I hope it's not too late
God only knows our fate
The error of our ways
Let's hope for a better day
Something's got to change
Let us pray

[Bridge: Terry Weeks & The Temptations]
(Why) Are there so many guns
(Tell me why) So much death among the young
(Why) Oh tell me why
(Tell me why) It's not easy for you to see
(Why) Can't there be any peace
(Tell me why) Can't we undo all the wrong that we've done, oh yeah
(Why) Oh it's up to you and me, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Terry Weeks, Wanda Vaughn & The Temptations]
They're fighting in Bosnia
And starving in Somalia
From free loving days
And now there is AIDS
Our values have changed (Oh)
People acting strange (Yeah)
You have to watch your back (Oh yeah)
Babies born on crack

[Chorus: The Temptations]
The error of our ways
Can we correct the mistakes we've made?
I hope it's not too late
God only knows our fate
The error of our ways
Let's hope for a better day
Something's got to change
Let us pray
The error of our ways
Can we correct the mistakes we've made?
I hope it's not too late
God only knows our fate
The error of our ways
Let's hope for a better day
Something's got to change
Let us pray

La, la, la
L-l-life without m-m-music's
Like l-l-life without love

Man, if we had no music what would we dance to?
What would we sing to?
How would them babies learn their ABC's
Oh, no

No, 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars'
No, 'Old McDonald Had A Farm'
And birds would have nothing to sing
No, 'Take Me Out To The Ball Game'

Life without music
This is terrible
(No, no, no)

Uh, we wouldn't even whistle
(No, no, no)
And we wouldn't have a heartbeat
'Cause we wouldn't know what a beat was
Life without music
That's so lame
(Life without music)
Man, we wouldn't even have no ring tones

Shawty the phone wouldn't even ring
(Life without music)
Uh, it would just vibrate

At least nobody will be able to download your songs
(Life without)
She's got a point

We' gon have to do something 'bout this
And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh
I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Heavy Hitter for life
Heavy hitters for life

You rappers think I give a f*ck about the way the day spent
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they sh*t
Everybody thought i was makin a compelation
I was really makin myself they competation
Fresh off the plane form the all star game
Bone girls on t.v so it's all star trains
Just picture man. No stichin man
Somethin for the phiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9/11 I was poor on a half till I floored up my math
Now it's Porsche 9/11 and I'm floorin the gas
Problems that i had no more
Well damn look at how everybody den changed
All my niggas is bout to have it made
Tell j that i'm bout to change the game
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye! Kanye! Kanye!
Now hold up. Ain't nobody makin with me dog now you say it
Ain't nobody messin with you at all
I told dude you can't even rap on my interlude
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
When the album comin out man the people is askin
Yall got motive adidas ya sick with the fashion
Ya already got do so ya spit for the passion
The way ya rhymes give me Tribe Called Quest flash backs
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope nope let's not do that man
Ya eatin up the game like Pac man
And got the whole world shakin just like crack phiends
Heavy hitters for life
Roca fella is for life throw them diamonds up throw them diamonds up trow ya diamonds
Though the times are getting wicked I'm older
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintaining, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an artist see
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next accounted by the press
Mad stress on my chest
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On "Any Given Sunday" I got to play my best

[Chorus]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight
Everything will be all right on any given Sunday
The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose
You know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Strive to achieve and die for what you believe

On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded
No defensive they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Chorus]
Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame can be as painful as
Death of patron
Young black, gifted
But I'm rapped in myself
Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars fell
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
As long as we play well they love us
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money why'all

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
This is just another day that I would spend waitin' for the right one
Staring at the night, and wishin' I could be the one to feel the warm sun...

[Pre Chorus]
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake;
I'm in Heaven, for Heaven's sake...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

[Chorus]
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

[Verse 2]
Tell me that you're living in a place where no one else can find you;
Tell me that you're singing out my name, hoping that I'll hear you...

[Pre Chorus]
Tell me "no", and I'll fade away
But this is lovin' that I won't waste...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...

[Chorus]
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

[Bridge]
"What are the words I'm needin' to hear?"
"How do I know if I'll ever love again?"
Seeing your face makes everything clear... (clear...) clear
And I'll never be the same...

[Chorus]
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...

[Verse 1]
You shed a shadow on my life
Shed a shadow on a love
Took the shelter out of my life
Took the shelter of a lie

I could see it in your restless eyes
The truth I was hiding
The truth you could not disguise

[Chorus 1]
But I never thought I'd see the day
I knew I'd need a miracle to make you stay
I knew I needed a miracle
And I never thought I'd see the day

[Verse 2]
You put a shadow on a love
Took a shelter of a lie
Took the shelter out of my life

[Chorus 2]
I wish you could shelter me
Shelter me now
I need a miracle
And I never thought I'd see the day

[Verse 1]
I have to come and see you
Maybe once or twice a year
I think nothing would suit me better right now
Than some downtown atmosphere
In the dance halls and the galleries
Or betting in the OTB
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

[Verse 2]
The sun goes down in Jersey
Rises over Little Italy
We could talk it up till the block gets up
Swapping stories
Sitting around in some all night zoo
Watching it run like a movie
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

[Chorus]
No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

[Verse 3]
But now it's cloak and dagger
Walk on eggshells and analyze
Every particle of difference
Gets like mountains in our eyes
You say, "You're unscrupulous!"
You say, "You're naïve!"
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

[Chorus]
No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

[Verse 4]
Sometimes change comes at you
Like a broadside accident
There is chaos to the order
Random things you can't prevent
There could be trouble around the corner
There could be beauty down the street
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

[Chorus]
No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel
No nerves of steel, no hearts of gold
No blame for what we can and can't control

[Outro]
Good friends, you and me
Good friends, you and me
Just for now, let's call it romance, just for now, let's take a chance
We both know it would seem to be the real thing
That makes the bells ring, but dare we dream?
Just for now, let's not be clever, just for now, let's just be gay
And come what may, that certain day will find us somehow
It will be always instead of just for now

Just for now, let's not be clever, just for now, let's just be gay
And come what may, that certain day will find us somehow
It will be always instead of just for now

Holy holy
Halo glowing
Candle burning
Christmas evening

Cold wind blowing
Old Man Winter
Inward glowing
Outside snowing

Morning Christmas
Children love to play
Children laugh
Children love to sing
A Christmas song

Holy holy
Halo glowing
Candle burning
Christmas evening
Come a bit close to me, let me be kissed
Come on and give to me what I have missed
I love you woman, I know that I'll get you somehow
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well, I'm telling you now

Morning and nighttime too, I'm so alone
Your love and my love, girl, we shall be one
I'm gonna get you or else there will be a big row
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well, I'm telling you now

I go to sleep at night, I'm telling you now
My heart is asking me why, I'm telling you now
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well, I'm telling you now

Come a bit close to me, let me be kissed
Come on and show to me what I have missed
I love you woman, I know that I'll get you somehow
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now...
I know it's wrong, the things I do
The way that I mistreated you
But I know, oh-oh, it's a sin
It's a sin

My baby watched me from the side
Then she hung her head and cried
But I know, oh-oh, it's a sin
It's a sin

My baby told me from the start
She said darling, you're breaking my heart
And I know, oh-oh, it's a sin
It's a sin

My baby told me from the start
She said darling, you're breaking my heart
And I know, oh-oh, it's a sin
It's a sin
I've come to feel that you're a blessing in disguise
Find a way of making sure
Is what you show to me the devil in your eyes
Are you the killer or the cure

I could be the fire you start
At just the mention of your name
I rise and I rise up to heaven my love
And let you shoot me down in flames
You don't take me serious
Too insane to see you're just too good to be true
And I don't sympathise with those
Who crawl home to you

Your head is on the line, you find no other love
And I would go through hell for you
Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me, will you ever let me in?

Maybe the trick is to be
Taken by surprise
And lady be wise, beware
The way to make you make that
Final sacrifice
The dream is real for those who dare
I will redefine your life
We remember till we die
When love is in motion who needs
More than this
And soon we know what passion is
All is fair in love and war
It's what I'm fighting for, but you're just too good
To be true
And I don't sympathise with those
Who crawl home to you

Your head is on the line, you find no other love
And I would go through hell for you
Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me, will you ever let me in?

I will be the fire you start
At just the mention of your name
All is fair in love and war
You know what I'm fighting for
Love has shot me serious
Right between the eyes
You're just too good
To be true
And I don't sympathise with those
Who crawl home to you
Your head is on the line, you find no other love
And I would go through hell for you
Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me, will you ever let me in?

Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me will you ever let me ...
Speaks:
I can just about get through the day
But the night makes me nervous
Not for any reason
Except maybe that it catches you unaware
And follows you the way a woman follows
When she wants something..
(music interlude)
I've been in every kind of night
Why, I shouldn't be afraid of darkness
But for some reason, the night makes me nervous

[Spoken Intro]
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

[Chorus]
Silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
The rope of silicon

[Verse 1]
One day you'll get outside the doo-rag
When you really want to contemplate this jacked up
Paranormal situation that your people got into
Can I hip you?
Long ago who considered the outcome?
Now I'm thinking that a cat like you would be troublesome
And sock you in the mind tangling curriculum
Guaranteed to leave you in a state of delirium
While all along teaching they kids in the valley to become unlike you
Broke and dumb

[Chorus]
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon

[Verse 2]
On a magical rope of silicon
You can bet that they'll be chillin' in Babylon
Thinking about a way that they can split the proton
While you eating all the bloody chicken and dead prawn
Mickey D. shake and a filet mignon
Swearing up and down you the picture of health, now come on

[Chorus]
Just a rope of silicon
Dance
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
You're just a rope of silicon
You

Welcome to the slaughterhouse

[Verse 3]
Leave that blood alone
Don't you know that dead blood kills interferons
Making the immune system victim to whereupon
Any known virus can boot up and log on
WWW dot you dot com

[Chorus]
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon

[Verse 4]
Now you've found me, now that you're here
Let's talk about the you in this con
If you're getting bored don't front, just yawn
This is the kind of stuff that requires patience
Never mind the rhyme just relax and wax the song
That on and on and on and on
Ain't gonna stop 'til the early mornin'
Break it down, later on come break down, y'all
What?

[Interlude]
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance on the funk
Just dance
Dance on the funk
Dance
Dance on the funk
Just dance
Dance on the funk

[Chorus]
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Just a rope

[Verse 5]
This is why you was looking for me?
Then check it
Let's talk about the you in this con
If you're getting bored don't front, just yawn
'Cause this is the kind of stuff that requires patience
Don't think, just wax on
If you are the eye that is the pawn
You beget the dead fruit of Armageddon
Thick skin reigns in the realm of the pseudonym
While the blows taken by the silly con
The family does well with God to keep it strong
Never a paradox, never a hexagon
You plus he or she keep going on
But with another one of you in the title of this song
Goes on and on and on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon

[Outro]
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance, dance on the funk
Dance
Dance

[Verse 1]
Tears streaming down, her heart is broken
Because her life is hurting, so am I
He wears a frown, his dreams are choking
And because he stands alone, his dreams will die
So, humbly I come to you and say
As I sound aloud the warfare of today
Hear me, I pray

[Chorus]
What about the children?
To ignore is so easy
So many innocent children will choose the wrong way
So what about the children?
Remember when we were children
And if not for those who loved us
And who cared enough to show us
Where would we be today? Mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Sir, where is your son?
Where lies his refuge?
And if he can't come to you, then where can he run?
Such a foolish girl, yet still, she's your daughter
And if you will just reminisce your days of young
You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done
Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes
See, His love overcomes

[Chorus]
And what about the children?
To ignore is so easy
So many innocent children will choose the wrong way
Yes, what about the children?
Remember when we were children
And if not for those who loved us
And who cared enough to show us
Where would we be today?

[Outro]
What about the children?
Don't just turn and walk away
What about the children?
They need our love and our help today
Yes, what about the children?
Remember when we were children
And if not for those who loved us
And who cared enough to show us
Where would we be today? Mmm, mmm
Where would we be today? Mmm, mmm
Where would we be today?
What about the the children?
On a snow crystal morning
Some place close to heaven
On the side of a mountain
In a race for the sun

In a matter of moments
The dream of a lifetime is won
There's a fire in the heart
And it feels like the hunger

The spirit is burning
Consumed by the flame
To be one of the best
Of the best in the world
Is its name

To be faster and farther
Than anyone's ever before
To be braver and stronger
And truer and then even more
To be all that you can be
And all that you've ever longed for

In the eyes of a mountain
All people are equal
In the eyes of all people
Our souls can be seen
In the course of our struggle
We'll know what humanity means

To be all that you can be
And all that you've ever longed for

We gather together
To face one another
We gather in silence
And sing in the sun
We gather in peace
To go for the gold and beyond
Come on, baby, could you ever be
Just a little close to me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Could we ever forget tonight?
Come on, baby, let's take a stroll
You're feelin' warm so don't be cold
Ooh, ooh, oh
We'll never forget tonight
What a wonderful night to be
The stars must be my friends
To shine for me
Come on, baby, now don't you be cold
Just remember that love is gold
Ooh, ooh
We will never forget tonight
With hands in the air you look like the girl at the fair with the bubbly eyes
Stonewashed shoe, pulling at a rock but the rock don't compromise
Come up to me say, why are you so skinny and pretty for a boy
Said thanks for the insult and compliment you'll never forget my face no more

I can't hardly reach you and I know it's getting harder to be you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
City I could take you, it will take a little second to break you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
I'll be driving you where nobody knows

Looking pretty pink sitting on a swing, that don't mean a thing at all
You heads on my feets, you barkin' like a puppy dog, sipping like a drink in the sun
Takin for your word, takin for a ride, take you for the evening, dead or alive
Warming up the car packing us some powder to play

I can't hardly reach you and I know it's getting harder to be you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
City I could take you, it will take a little second to break you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
I'll be driving you where nobody knows... Jessica...
We like the stones, stoned like a rock, clogging up your nose again
Papa is a searching, devil is a knocking, juice swimmin up my skin here
Here goes now
I'm gonna move, baby, way out on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around

I'm gonna tell you baby, we're gonna move away from here
I don't want no ice man, I'm gonna get me a frigidaire
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around

I'm gonna bring my own groceries, gonna bring them everyday
That'll stop the grocery boy, and keep him away

When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't need nobody always hanging around
It may seem funny honey, as funny as funny can be
But if we have any children, I want them all to look like me
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody always hanging around

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill
It's growing
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel
It's growing
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun
It's growing
Like the tale by the time it's been told by more than one, hoo
It's growing

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and it grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows
(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows)
How it grows, and it grows, and it grows
(Nobody knows) Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody knows, it grows, it grows, where is it gonna stop)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Woo, like a need in a guy to see his girl
When she's gone away, it's growing
Like the sadness in his little heart
When he knows that she's gone to stay, woo, it's growing

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and it grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows
(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows) It gets a little wider
(Nobody knows) Oh, it gets a little stronger
(Hey, hey, hey) The feeling for each kiss, baby
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, it lasts a little longer, yeah
(Hey, hey, hey) Ooh, so much... ooh, so much
Can't you see it's growing, baby?
It grows, and it grows, and it grows, and it grows
B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

Well I looked at the clock
The clock said four
My baby jumped up
She said, "B., let's go"

Do the B.B. boogie baby
B.B. boogie darlin'
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

Grabbed my bay turned her round and round
She said, "B.'s the boogiest man in town"

B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

I grabbed my baby and I held her tight
Me and my baby do the boogie all night
B.B. boogie darlin'
The B.B. boogie baby
Do the B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long

I grabbed my baby and I held her tight
She said, "love me baby and squeeze me tight"

The B.B. boogie
B.B. boogie darlin'
B.B. boogie, if it takes you all night long
Give her sunshine in your smile
Give her pleasure all the while
Turn her thoughts from clouds of gray
Give her strength to face each day

Give her laughter be her friend
Stay beside her till the end
But, in giving all else above
Don't forget to give her love

But, in giving all else above
Don't forget to give her love

[Verse 1]
Funny, how I've stopped loving you
I can listen to your name and it doesn't start a flame
Not much, so much my heart wants to cry
Oh oh oh yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
It's funny how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny
I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you too much

[Bridge]
Now that you are standing here
Darling, I won't shed a tear
This is just the rain in my eyes
And if I have proved to you that everything I say is true
Please help me believe my own lies

[Outro]
Girl, it's funny how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny
I don't miss all of the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you, not too much, baby, not too much
Oh, you went away and left me, baby
I don't love you, too much
Just with all my heart, dear

[Verse 1]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I say my prayers every night
I promise

[Verse 2]
I know which side I'm spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise

[Chorus]
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise

[Verse 3]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise

[Chorus]
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise

[Outro]
I won't run away no more
I promise
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain, chain, chain
Give us Jah victory again and again
The Conquering Lion shall break every chain
The Conquering Lion shall break every chain
The Conquering Lion shall break every chain, chain, chain
Give us Jah victory again and again
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain, chain, chain
Give us Jah victory again and again
Give us Jah victory again and again
In Mount Zion
With King Alpha and Queen Omega
Father and Mother of Creation
Alleluia!
Made myself a sandwich
Put it in my hatchback
A "psychoanalyst"
"So we try" empty heart
I'm so hungry for love
....
....
Late in the evening
City sleeping
All through the night
This feeling’s creeping on me
So ready

Soul is waiting
Body’s aching
Caught and imprisoned
My own making
I’m so, so ready
I’m so gone, come get me
Won’t you come?

Set me free
Make me yours again
(Free)
In your arms again
(Free)
Won’t you come and dance with me
Throw out the lifeline
I’ve been sinking
Going out of my mind
I’ve been thinking
If I could hold her
Make this storm blow over

Give me a taste of satisfaction
Oh, I need to learn her
I need her faster
I’m so wide open
Won’t you come right over?
Won’t you come?

Set me free
Make me yours again
(Free)
In your arms again
(Free)
Won’t you come and dance with me

I’ve been looking for a light
Let it shine
Let it shine
You’ve been running through my mind
All this time
All this time
Set me free
Free…
I feel like…
Oh, to be free…
Hold that train, conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Hold that train, conductor
Please don't let that engineer start
Well, I wanna ride your train this morning
Just to ease my achin' heart

Yes, for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Yes, for the last few mornings lately
Before I get out of my bed
Well, I hear your whistle moanin'
And it almost drives me out of my head

I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin'
All your money's right here in my pants
Well, I know I should back and buy a ticket
Yes, but I'm afraid to take the chance
Oh, don't stop this train, conductor
Till this old state is out of sight
Yes, don't stop this train, conductor
Till Mississippi is out of sight
Well, you know I'm going to California
Where I, I know my baby will treat me right

[Verse 1:]
Since you've been gone I've been lonely
Longing to be with you only
Maybe there's still is a way I could find you
And say  just how I feel
I can't believe that it's over
Wished somehow I could have showed her
All that was inside my heart 'stead of playing the games
You might have stayed

[Pre-Chorus:]
Funny just the other night I was thinking
I wondered if you ever think about me
I call you on the phone, there's no answer

[Chorus:]
Oh well, there's still tomorrow
Oh well, I'll try again
Oh well, maybe just maybe

[Verse 2:]
Since you've been gone I've been lonely
Longing to be with you only
If there's a way I could beg you to stay
Would you please stay with me?

[Pre-Chorus:]
I was thinking maybe I could come over
Hoping we could find a way, work this out
Even if tonight we don't find an answer

[Chorus:]
Oh well, there's still tomorrow
Oh well, I'll try again
Oh well, maybe just maybe

Oooh..

[Bridge:]
If I had another chance
We would stand hand in hand
You'd be my girl
I'd be your man
Oh well, maybe just maybe we can

I still call you on the phone, still no answer
Maybe later on I'll try one more time
Or am I just a fool to keep trying?

[Chorus:]
Oh well, there's still tomorrow
Oh well, a fool's what I am
Oh well, maybe just maybe
Oh well, there's still tomorrow
Oh well, maybe just maybe
See if I got down on my knees and give you every little part of me

[Chorus:]
Oh well, there's still tomorrow
Oh well, I'll try again
Oh well, please just maybe

Since you've been gone, I've been lonely

[Verse 1]
Tomorrow is Sunday, now there's only one day left to go
'Til you walk by below my window
The weekends drive me mad, holidays are all too sad
'Cause you don't go below my window

[Chorus]
No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here with a view
When you walk by below my window

[Verse 2]
You look so youthful, time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you thirty years ago
Hot days, your shirt's undone, rainy days, you run
Oh, and then you fade so fast below my window

[Chorus]
No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here with a view
Only when you walk by below my window
When you walk by

[Outro]
Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my window
Uh, uh huh
Gangster

[Verse 1:]
I though it was love
Didn't wanna admit that
When I looked back
It was lust
Too bad I had to learn a lesson
They're against me
You were with me
But you never let your old thang go
I don't care to know why
Girl I guess some things
Can't be explained

[Chorus:]
It is what it is (what it is)
I don't know what to call it
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (uh huh)
When it's really something else

[Verse 2:]
Know that is okay
Felt something going on
For every time that I thought it (uh)
Girl I bet that's what it was
Called myself being down for you (ice cold)
Just know that
Before I knew you I already knew you
How you get down (uh)
But if that's your thang, babe
I ain't mad at you
It's cool
Just know I did it too

[Chorus:]
It is what it is
I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (aww girl)
When it's really something else (yeah, yeah)
Take it to the bridge

[Bridge:]
I'm not saying that two wrongs can make it right
It ain't too late for us to try (yeah)
Do we put back together
Or we say goodbye? (ha)
Give me another chance
You did it too, shit
It's all good, baby
We even, right?
Well how can I smile, shit?
It's better to smile than to frown anyday
Yeah listen

[Chorus:]
It is what it is
I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (Girl I'm feeling something else)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (get caught up)
When it's really something else (if you want to get to be with me baby)

[Chorus:]
It is what it is (what it is)
I don't know what to call it (call it)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (uh, uh uh yeah yeah come on)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up, when I)
When it's really something else (oh my)
To the bridge

[Bridge:]
I'm not saying that two wrongs can make a right
But it ain't too late for us to try (baby)
Do we put back together
Or we say goodbye? (come on ya'll)

[Chorus:]
It is what it is (what is)
I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it uhhh uhh)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up oh no, no)
When it's really something else (gonna give my love)

[Chorus:]
It is what it is (ohhh, i)
I don't know what to call it (call it but)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (OHH)
When it's really something else (gonna give my love)

[Chorus:]
It is what it is
I don't know what to call it (oohhh oh yeah)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love)
It is what it is (oh oh, ohhh)
Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up when I…)
When it's really something else (gonna give my love)

[Chorus:]
It is what it is (what it is)
I don't know what to call it (call it 'cause I'm feeling)
'Cause I'm feelin' something else (feeling something uh, uh, uh, uh)
It is what it is (what it is)
Just don't let yourself get caught up
When it's really something else (gonna give my love)

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her
Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm

So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed

She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again

I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no

(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

I think I... I think I... I think I love her

(Raspberry beret)
No no no
No no no (The kind you find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love...

[Intro]
We have to find our heartsongs all by ourselves
It's the voice you hear inside
Who you truly are

(Hear me)
Raise your voices brothers and sisters
Praise for the great one who put songs in our hearts (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You might make a different song, oh yes, that's right, it's true
That don't make anybody more or less as good as you
If you can't feel the music then that's all you really need
Then turn this party all the way out, good time guaranteed

[Chorus]
Everybody get up, clap your hands and dancin' to the beat
Whatever you do, little darlin' it's cool, just get up out your seat
And wave your flag because everybody plays a part
One world united singing the song of the heart
The song, the song of the heart
The song, the song of the heart (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Look, everybody makes mistakes, oh yeah, not one or two (Right!)
But that don't make the dirty little things they say about you true (You tell 'em!)
Step aside little babies and watch me do my thing
I don't even need a good reason to listen to me sing

[Chorus]
Everybody get up, clap your hands and show them what you got
Tonight we gonna jam from now until eternity, don't you stop, make it hot
And wave a flag because everybody plays a part
One world united singing this song, this song of the heart
The song, the song of the heart
The song, the song of the heart

[Breakdown]
Come on!
Watch me now

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't care what the people say (Say)
This is my life (This is my life)
I just got to like that okay (Okay?)
They can go fly their mama's kite
Hooray!

[Interlude]
We could be together if we all do our part
I'll let you if you let me sing the song of the heart
We could be together if we all do our part
I'll let you if you let me sing the song of the heart

[Outro]
All right I'm going to tell you one more time
Listen, uh
One world
One world
One world united
Singing a song
Singing a song
Singing a song of the heart
Feel me? Oh yeah (The song, the song of the heart)
Feel me? Keep singin' (The song, the song of the heart)
Oh (The song of the heart)
You do you, I do me, whatever (The song of the heart)
To the left, to the right, I'm getting it, oh yeah
Look out, oh yeah (Here I go)
I got it, I got it, I don't, I had it
Hahaha
Oh, my stomach hurts, I gotta pee
I'll be the one, oh, yeah
Oh, c'mon, c'mon, ooh
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies
There you are wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light, I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright
'Cuz my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light, yeah
There you are wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light, I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright, yeah
You need me, I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, baby, please
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run
I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light, I'll be the light
When you feel like there's no where to run
I'll be the one
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one, I'll be the light
Where you can run to make it alright
I'll be the one
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright
I'll be the one, yeah
You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitchin' too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Oh darling how could we end up like this? Oh baby, let me reminisce
Oh and when we, woo, we stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire
My one desire was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby, oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I laugh at men too
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can really never outweigh the bad
Oh, I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby
It's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darlin'
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
Ah, we tried, God knows we tried
Now it's too late to live and love and ah, it's too late baby
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry
Oh oh ohhh, it's much too late
Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy

[Intro]
What now?

[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Outro]
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?
Time's on your hands, on your hands
But you never had so much to do
She's got your heart, got your heart
She'll never give it back to you
You know love takes time
But it's well worth the wait
Tell her today, boy, tomorrow's way too late

If Love Takes You Away
It can take you where you want to go
If Love Takes You Away
Let it take you where you'll never go

Wait for tonight, for tonight
Tonight is always on its way
Talk with a beat, with a beat
You never had so much to say
Put your heart down as a bet
Winner gets a kiss
If you're playing the first time
You can't miss
If Love Takes You Away
It can take you where you want to go
If Love Takes You Away...
(Love takes you away, away)

It's all in the way, all in the way
All in the way you show
You're not afraid to climb
'Cause it may be the first time
Yes, it may be the last time
You never really know

If Love Takes You Away
It can take you where you want to go
If Love Takes You Away
(Love'll take you, it'll take you)
If Love Takes You Away
(Oh, love takes you away, away)
If Love Takes You Away
(Oh, Love Takes You Away, away)
She's a fool and don't I know it?
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it?
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately, I've not slept a wink
Since this silly situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it?
She is cold, I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
It must be getting early, clocks are running late
Paint-by-number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere, light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

I see you've got your list out, say your peace and get out
Guess I get the gist of it, but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way, the only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

It's a lesson to me
The Ables and the Bakers and the C's
The ABC's we all must face
Try to keep a little grace
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABC's we all think of
And try to wean a little love

I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright
Cow is giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

The shoe is on the hand it fits, there's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright
Oh well, a touch of grey kinda suits you anyway
And that was all I had to say and it's alright

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
Now is the hour
When we must say goodbye
And each hour I'll miss you
Far across the sea

While I'm away
Oh, please, remember me
Someday I'll sail across the seas
Back to you

It's not goodbye
It's just a sweet adieu
'Cause someday, I'll sail across the seas
Home to you

[Verse 1]
You may see me laughing
You may see me crying
But you won't see me give up
I'll just keep on trying
Though sometimes it get hard
Hard to see my way
But I've got you in my life
It's makes it all okay, yeah

[Chorus]
Nothing comes today
When you're treating me this way
And I thank You Lord for treating me so good (So good)
There are times when I get scared
But I'll know that You'll be there
And You'll pull me out of it for sure (For sure)

[Verse 2]
There are times I'm up
There are times I'm down
There are times I'm smiling
There are times I'm frowned
Sometimes I've done wrong
I still sing my song
Even when I'm weak, I know you make me strong

[Chorus]
Nothing comes today
When you're treating me this way (Treat me this way)
And I thank You Lord for treating me so good
(Oh, I thank You, Lord, I thank You, Lord, for treating me so good)
There are times when I get scared
(There are times when I get scared)
But I'll know that You'll be there
(And I know You will be there)
And You'll pull me out of it for sure (For sure)

[Bridge]
For sure (For sure)
For sure (For sure)
Things are gonna work out, they're gonna work out
(Things are gonna work out for sure)
For sure, for sure
(For sure) For sure (For sure)
Things are gonna work out, they're gonna work out
(Things are gonna work out for sure) Uh-huh

[Verse 3]
I've learned how to do with
How to do without
When to shut my mouth
When to speak out loud
I'm happy to know
I have You as my friend
Others will come and go but
You'll be there 'til the end

[Chorus]
Nothing comes today
When you're treating me this way (You treat me so good, so good)
And I thank You Lord for treating me so good (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
There are times when I get scared
(Times when I get scared)
But I'll know that You'll be there
(But I know You will be there)
And You'll pull me out of it for sure

[Outro]
For sure (For sure)
For sure (For sure)
Things are gonna work out
(Things are gonna work out for sure)
It's gonna work out, oh, oh, oh, for sure (For sure)
Oh, for sure (For sure)
Things are gonna work out, gonna work out
(Things are gonna work out for sure)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure (For sure)
It doesn't matter what your faith is (For sure)
Things are gonna work out
(Things are gonna work out for sure)
I know, I know, I know, for sure (For sure)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (For sure)
Things are gonna work out
(Things are gonna work out for sure)
The moon was yellow and the night was young
A smile brought us together and I was wondering whether
We'd meet again someday
The moon was yellow and a song was sung
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination
To give my heart away

Here we are, is our romance to continue?
Will it be my luck to win you?
May I look that far?

My love is mellow and my hopes are strong
Around that cupid fellow
Behold, the moon is yellow
And the night is young

(Here we are, is our romance to continue?)
Will it be my luck to win you?
May I look that far?

My love is mellow and my hopes are strong
Around that cupid fellow
Behold, the moon is yellow
And the night is young

[Verse 1]
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
After all these years
You still treat me wrong
Why do you wanna wear me down?
No, don't tear me down

[Chorus]
Girl, ain't I been good to you (So good)
Say, baby (So good)
Now, didn't I give it all to you (So good)
Hey, baby (So good)

[Verse 2]
I gave it all, baby, and I trusted you
Though there have been times you haven't been true
You don't have to hide from me
And ah, don't lie to me

[Chorus]
Girl, ain't I been good to you (So good)
Hey, baby (So good)
Didn't I run it all down to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)

[Verse 3]
I will go on, baby, loving you
Because you're all I am used to
I haven't the strength to fight
So don't you wanna do me right?

[Chorus]
Girl, ain't I, woo (So good)
Baby (So good)
Said ain't I been good to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)
Said that I've been, ow (So good)
Good to you, babe (So good)
Ain't I been good to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)
Didn't I run it all down (So good)
All down to you (So good)
Ain't I been, ow (So good)
Good to you, baby (So good)
Said that I've been, ha (So good)
Good to you, baby (So good)
Yeah, I've been so good (So good)
To you, baby (So good)
Ha, gotta say I've been, oh (So good)
Good to you (So good)
I'm regretting (So good)
Yeah, baby (So good)
Said I've been, oh (So good)
Oh (So good)
Good to you (So good)
Say, baby (So good)
You talk about your woman but I've got woman too
As a matter of fact, boy, I had yours a long time before you met
Let me tell you somethin' you may not understand
Well, you can laugh at me and I'll grin at you
But Lord, I'm a better lovin' man

You say that I look funny the way I talk and dress
You drive around in your XKE and thinkin' I'm impressed
But let me tell you somethin' that you may not understand
Yes, you can laugh at me and I'll grin at you
But hey, I'm a better lovin' man

So you just go on about your business and stop messin' with my life
Don't you try to play with my mind, boy, and I'll let you keep your wife
Let me tell you somethin' that you may not understand
Yes, you can laugh at me and I'll grin at you
But I'm a better lovin' man
Knocked down everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I've known this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand

You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
Me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah, me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah
Me, me, me, me, me, me, yeah, you know better than I do

Knocked down everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I've known this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You know better than I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
There's a road that I must go
There are short cuts that I know
But I know that we'll make it eventually
On a starlight ride

There's a fire down below
(that remains in me)
When the chilly winds will blow
(it will comfort me)
But as long as we let all our feelings show
It will never die

Feel the magic in the air
(On a summer night)
See the road ahead is clear
(Not a soul in sight) Let's take every moment and drink it down
Like a mellow wine

In the slipstream of the night
(I hear music play)
Though its road is crystal bright
(Seems so far away)
And it leads us from here to forevermore
On a starlight ride
Crazy preachers of our doom
Telling us there is no room
Not enough for all mankind
And the seas of time are running dry
Don't they know it's a lie...

Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take no for an answer
He will get by, somehow he'll try
He won't take no, never let go, no...

I hear them talk about Kingdom Come
I hear them discuss Armageddon...
They say the hour is getting late
But I can still hear someone say
This is not the way...

(repeat)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were
With sweet love and devotion, deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I just want to stop and thank you, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went, it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me, all of my days
With a love so sweet, in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I just want to stop and thank you, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better for me, than I was for myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I just want to stop and thank you, baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

La la da da da da la da da da shoobe do be do wa skibitty do da da da la
Get jiggy with it scubbydooby wa

[Verse 1]
If I ever had the chance
To be the king of this whole land
I wouldn't do it if you couldn't be beside me
On your love you have me strung
You are the breath of life in my lungs
And I thank you for the love that you've shown me
Before I go to sleep I pray
And thank the lord for another day with you
You're my dream come true

[Chorus]
I can love you the way
That you want me to
My love, the things I do
Are for you

[Verse 2]
Girl you're all I ever need
And you're mine exclusively
When we're all alone I wish the time
Remains the same
From the time the sun appears
'Till the moon's reflection is clear
I think about your love
And hope that it stays near
I'll take you all around this earth
To show you just how much you're worth
To me, you're my destiny

[Chorus]
I can love you the way
That you want me to
My love, the things I do
Are for you
I can love you the way
That you want me to
My love, the things I do
Are for you

[Bridge]
You're all the reason that I live
And all the love that I have I'll give
To you, you're my dream come true
And I promise

[Chorus]
I can love you the way
That you want me to
My love, the things I do
Are for you
There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

[Verse 1]
Everybody looks so ill at ease, so distrustful, so displeased
Running down the table, I see a borderline
Like a barbed wire fence strung tight, strung tense
Prickling with pretense, a borderline

[Chorus 1]
Why are you smirking at your friend?
Is this to be the night when all well-wishing ends?
All credibility revoked, thin skin, thick jokes
Can we blame it on the smoke, this borderline?

[Verse 2]
Every bristling shaft of pride, church or nation, team or tribe
Every notion we subscribe to is just a borderline
Good or bad, we think we know, as if thinking makes things so
All convictions grow along a borderline

[Chorus 2]
Smug in your jaded expertise
You scathe the wonder world and you praise barbarity
In this illusionary place, this scared hard-edged rat race
All liberty is laced with borderlines

[Verse 3]
Every income, every age, every fashion-plated rage
Every measure, every gauge creates a borderline
Every stone thrown through glass, every mean street's kick ass
Every swan caught on the grass will draw a borderline

[Chorus 3]
You snipe so steady, you snub so snide
So ripe and ready to diminish and deride
You're so quick to condescend, my opinionated friend
All you deface, all you defend is just a borderline

[Outro]
Just a borderline
Another borderline
Just a borderline
Well, I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Waitin' for the train, yeah
Take me home, yeah
From this lonesome place
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes
My girl had called me a disgrace

Dig
The tears burnin'
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me
Way down in my heart
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl
It's too bad
Too bad we have to part (have to part)

Dig
Gonna leave this town, yeah
Gonna leave this town
Gonna make a whole lotta money
Gonna be big, yeah
Gonna be big, yeah
I'm gonna buy this town
I'm gonna buy this town
An' put it all in my shoe
Might even give a piece to you
That's what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do

[Verse 1]
It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the mornin' sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out mama 'cause I'm comin' home tonight

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on the sound
Of some open hearted people goin' down

[Verse 2]
I'm not goin' back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to hear that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No I don't believe I'll be goin' back that way

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load

[Verse 1]
Girl, I can't believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye?
See you're taking away my reason for living
And you won't even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
There's something I want you to know

[Chorus]
That I could never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
(I could never love another)
Cause none can compare
After loving you

[Verse 2]
It was only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
Baby, you said long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave me behind
Listen, baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way

[Chorus]
'Cause I could never, never, never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other will I share
(I could never love another)
'Cause none, none can compare
After loving you

[Bridge]
So, baby, please stay beside me
I need your sweet love to guide me
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I could never love another)
Ooh, after loving you
(I could never love another after loving you)

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, baby, it was only, only, only, only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
I remember you said
Long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave, leave me behind
Listen, baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way

[Chorus]
I could never, never, never, never, ever love another after loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
(I could never love another)
'Cause none, none can compare
After loving you

[Outro]
Ooh, baby, on my bended knees I'm beggin you to stay here with me
Ooh
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I could never, never, ever, never, ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
(I could never love another)
'Cause none can compare
After loving you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I could never love another)
So what's up?

Oh, hey hey, yeah

Yeah
I know I'll never find another hunk of woman like my Ann
She makes me feel like a great big man
I'm gonna go tell her momma what I think about her, say thank you ma'am
For giving me your daughter Ann

She sure is stacked from her toes to the pretty little nape
Of her neck she's packed like a seed in a grape
She's smooth, has marble skin
When I see her I believe I'm a real big guy
And when I go to work I'm thinking I might die
If I can't hurry home again
If the good Lord works a hundred years at makin' me a female plan
I'd say, no, thanks, Lord, I'll just keep Ann

How could I ever look at any other woman when I've got Ann
I feel so good when she takes my hand
I'm gonna go tell her daddy what I think about her, say thank you, man
For giving me your daughter Ann

When I come home and feel like I've been run over
By a ten ton truck she can rub my shoulder
And ease my aches and pains
When I lose my job and I'm down to a silver dollar
And I feel like a dried up gourd in a holler
She cools my brow like summer rain
If the good Lord works all night at makin' me a female plan
I'd say, no, thanks, Lord, I'll just keep Ann
One more time!
I know I'll never find another hunk of woman like my Ann
She makes me feel like a great big man
If the good Lord worked a hundred years at makin' me a female plan
I'd say, no thanks, Lord, I'll just keep Ann
I'd say, no thanks, Lord, I'll just keep Ann
Yeah!
I'd like to introduce...

(We here, we here, we here, we here...)
We here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system

Let's try, let's try, let's, let's try
Lets try something else

Folks, we have a very special guest
For you, tonight, night, night

Break it down
Cut it up

Using the waves of sound
A true master paralyzes his opponent
Leaving him vulnerable to attack

Mr. Hahn
There's a tenderness that I feel, it's very real you see
I can feel your body stir so deep within
Let it be an out of love tonight completely
And let me ask of you one thing

Don't close your eyes tonight
Just look at me and see how many times I cried for you
Don't close your eyes tonight
Let it be me, not just a fantasy
Let it be me tonight

Well you can lie so close to someone and still feel alone
And though I heard you say you loved me so many times
While you give me love so beautiful and tender
Someone else is in your mind

Don't close your eyes tonight
Just look at me and see how many times I cried for you
Don't close your eyes tonight
Let it be me, not just a fantasy
Let it be me tonight
Sorry if I cry - feelings run so deep
Many is a time when I'll wake up and find
That I'm crying in my sleep
Look me in the eye, tell me what you see
I'm the one who loves you, I'm the one who needs you
Make this one for me

Don't close youe eyes tonight
Just look at me and see how many times I cried for you
Don't close your eyes tonight
Let it be me, not just a fantasy
Let it be me tonight
Blue jean baby, L.A lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You married the music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard ain't that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows
The tunes she hums

But oh how real it feels
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You married the music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how real it feels
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Repeat chorus
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of Columbine

Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his Columbine

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel Columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero . . . . . . Threepenny Pierrot
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was
Snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the
Level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and
Persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Oh, but you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all
Fears
Bury the rag deep in your face, for now's the time for your
Tears
Computer voice: R-E-M-I-X

Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother I can't believe it's true (believe it's true)
I'm so scared about the future
And I wanna talk to you

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...
Are you lost or incomplete
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece
Tell me how you feel
How you feel
How you feel
How you feel

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung, or do
Something that's never been done

Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

Computer voice: Now talk baby!

How you feel
How you feel (how you feel)
How you feel...
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
When you worry about the future or the third world war
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

[Verse 1]
Dressed in bishop's robes
Terrifies me still in bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster

[Chorus]
I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back

[Verse 2]
Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits on playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes

[Chorus]
I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back
I know there were a hundred ways to tell her I loved her
It's funny how they're all so clear today
And when her face was burning with sadness and yearning
I don't know why I turned my eyes away
But it's so easy looking at the game the morning after
Adding up the kisses and the laughter
Knowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came
But then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game
The room was so alive with all her feelings and longings
I saw the spark of danger in her eyes
Well, how would it have hurt me if I'd turned back and held her?
A moment passes, something lovely dies
But it's so easy looking at the game the morning after
Adding up the kisses and the laughter
Knowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came
But then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game
Yes, it's easier to win it when you know you'd never play it quite the same
But then, this Monday morning quarterback never lost a game
I won't ever cry for you
And you won't ever she'd tears for me
There's nothing up my sleeve
That you haven't already seen
It's not that I don't care at all
We lost touch so long ago
It may be our anniversary
But I, I wouldn't really know

The phone won't ever ring
In the middle of the night
And if it ever does
I can assure you it won't be me

I'll find somebody new
And you might find somebody too
There's something up my sleeve
That you haven't already seen
It's not that I don't care anymore
We lost touch so long ago
It may be our anniversary
But I, I wouldn't really know
My phone won't ever ring
In the middle of the night
And if it ever does
I can assure you it won't be me

It's not that I don't care at all
We lost touch so long ago
It may be our anniversary
But I, I wouldn't really know
Good good timin'
Good good timin'
Ahhhh Ahhhh
You need good timin'
Good good timin'

All us people
Now we're just livin'
The world keeps turnin'

Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you're watching in the night
All alone with me, and we're waiting for the sunlight

[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel like I can't go on, you come and hold me
It's you and me forever

[Chorus]
Sara smile (smile)
Why don't you smile awhile for me
Sara

[Verse 2: Wanya]
If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
And if you wanna be free, you know
All you got to do is say so

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
'Cause it's you and me forever

Oh my love hurry back I'm yours

Return to me
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back hurry home to my arms
To my lips and my heart

Retorna me
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu
Mio cuore

[Verse 1]
The first thing I did wrong
Was hook up with a girl that wasn't grown
She looked like a woman but her mind worked like a child
It was her girlish qualities that made me smile (made me so happy)
The outside never showed me what was in
And her ending didn't look like it began
Now I know and it's for sure
That you can't change a girl into a woman

[Chorus]
I'm okay, make sure you're okay
No matter how long it takes
Make sure that you're okay
And if she goes away
Make sure that you're okay
Now that I got out
I'm just looking out
Trying to show you the way to be okay

[Verse 2]
Now I hate to see you make the same mistakes
So avoid the things that 'cause your heart to break
From a hurting brother, I ain't trying to hate
(I ain't tryna hate a brother)
But if you mess around with her she'll seal your fate
You'll never see it coming 'til it's there
And you'll find out that she doesn't really care (she don't)
And it's real what I feel
You can have her ass, I don't want her over here

[Chorus]
I'm okay, make sure you're okay
No matter how long it takes
Make sure that you're okay
And if she goes away
Make sure that you're okay
Now that I got out
I'm just looking out
Trying to show you the way to be okay

[Bridge]
If you decide to stay, it's alright (it's your decision)
But take heed to what I say, you'll be alright (listen to what I'm saying)
If you decide to go, then go now (you better leave her)
Don't look back because she'll only bring you down
Oh, bring you down
Bring you down (bring you down)

Sing it one time
Okay, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Make sure you'll be okay
It's okay, it's okay
Okay, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Make sure you'll be okay
(Now that I got out, I'm just looking out)
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus]
I'm okay, make sure you're okay
No matter how long it takes
Make sure you're okay
And if she goes away
Make sure you're okay
Now that I got out
I'm just looking out
Trying to show you the way to be okay

I'm okay, make sure you're okay
No matter how long it takes
Make sure that you're okay
And if she goes away
Make sure that you're okay
Now that I got out
I'm just looking out
Trying to show you the way to be okay

Okay, okay, gotta make sure...
What a diff'rence a day makes
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine
What a diff'rence a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a diff'rence a day makes
And the difference is you
What a diff'rence a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a diff'rence a day makes
And the difference is you
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh

Some where far some place where no one else can go
Some place where only you and I know how to get there
Some place where only doves have seen the skies
Some place where only you and I know how to get there

And we can touch the sky
Together we can find a way
We can make it there
And no one will stand in our way
We can even go where nobody knows
Where only you and I...

We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
A place in the sun, a place that's further than the stars
A place where only you and I know how to get there
It's not as far as Jupiter but further than Mars
A place where only you and I know how to get there

And we can touch the sky
Together we can find our way
We can make it there
And no one will stand in our way
We can even go where nobody knows
Where only you and I...

We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh

We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
We Could Fly Away
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh
Now that I know your name and you know mine
Ain't it just about time that we got together?
We should make such beautiful music forever
Oh, together forever

Put your trust in me, I'll never let you down
'Cause I know I can count on you to help me make it
Ain't no doubt about it
We can work it out, work it out
I know we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Ooh wee!

[Chorus:]
Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
(Everybody sing) Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
(Everybody sing) Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out

Makin' music naturally, me and W.B

[Chorus]
Music for the young and old, music bound to be gold
Work it out

Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out 

[x2]

Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out (Can we work it out?)
Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out (I want to work it out)
Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
(Everybody sing) Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
(Everybody sing) Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out
(Everybody sing) Hope we work it out, I hope we work it out

Makin' music naturally, me and W.B
We got a little serious there—I think "fisting" should be called "upper-cunting." And we're back.

Do you guys like impressions?

(Yeah.)

Why?

That was Socrates.

Older traditional stand-up comics sometimes have problems with me
Because they think I use music and other stuff
And they think I'm a gimmick, I'm a hack, you know, I'm a gimmick comic
And they're such comedy purists, they don't think my comedy can stand on it's own
But the truth is, I'm a comedy purist, too
So I can do comedy without gimmicks
I'll show you that right now
What do you call a kid with no arms and an eye-patch?
Names!
For those listening on the CD, I just gave birth to a dove
I love traditional stand-up comedy, don't get me wrong
I love it. I'm a huge fan of traditional stand-up comics
A lot of them are my heroes
And I want to be a traditional stand-up comic
And I've been working on some traditional stand-up material and
It's in its infancy so, please, bare with me, go easy
But this is a bit of my traditional stand-up

(pause)

My wife, right?

We never have sex! Like, ever which is really funny

Something else - I never know what she's saying! She'll say something and I'll be like, "PFT" You know, she's constantly emasculating me and I'm making her resent herself for getting older so we're looking into a divorce

-and, you know, something else that's really funny: she can't drive! The only think she can drive is DRIVE ME CRAZY and when she back talks I hit her
People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord

People get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers, coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all among those loved the most

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
Oh, there's no hidin' place against the kingdom's throne

So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith, open the doors and board 'em
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
This is the story of Hezekiah Jones
Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas
He never had too much, except he had some land
An' he had a couple of hogs and things like that
He never had much money
But he'd spend what he did make as fast as he made it
So it never really mattered that he had much money
But in a cupboard there, he kept in the cupboard...
He kept in the cupboard books
He called the books his "rainy season."
The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...
They... said, "Well... old Hezekiah, he's harmless enough
But the way I see it he better put down them goddam books
Readin' ain't no good, for nigga is nigga."
One day the white man's preacher came around
Knockin' on doors, knockin' on all the doors in the county
He knocked on Hezekiah's door
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?"
Hezekiah says, "Well, I don't know, I never really SEEN the Lord
I can't say, yes, I do..."
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?"
Hezekiah says, "Well, the Church is divided, ain't they
And... they can't make up their minds
I'm just like them, I can't make up mine either."
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?"
Hezekiah says, "I'm good... good as my neighbor."
"You don't believe in nothin'," said the white man's preacher
You don't believe in nothin'!"
"Oh yes, I do," says Hezekiah
"I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbors
Not for the reward of a Heaven or fear of hellfire."
"But you don't understand," said the white man's preacher
"There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked..."
Then they hung Hezekiah high as a pigeon
White folks around there said, "Well... he had it comin'
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch never had no religion!"
Lying there beside you in the dark, I could not see
Past the light you had set there for me
Oh, that night had it's meaning and the flame shook your room
From the walls to the beating of my heart

But now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Yes, now you're gone
And I won't worry any more

Oh, your sighs screamed with loneliness
Your eyes traced broken dreams
And your touch held a warning of goodbye

Oh, many's the times I've reached for you
More's the times I've failed
I'm the reason, I'm the cause of it all

But now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Now you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Why you begged me?
Must we stay here but to wait a bitter end
Than the silence this dimming light foretells

Why the future? Why the past?
Why this moments cold retreat?
How do I know there's no relief you can bring?

And I was lost, I could not answer
No, I could not shed a tear
To the ghost of a love that could have been

Well, I see them all just coming
And I know that they're all gone
But as you're near I won't worry any more

And now you're gone
And I worry anymore
Yes, you're gone
And I won't worry any more
Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pools of fascination in my sleep
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Warming up my cold within his heat

Bouncing down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me to complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears

It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
It's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me, I find my insides sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind

Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years, in years
It's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on the mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name

Sealing all the floodgates of his passion
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination, oh no

He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning, I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land

It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years, in years
It's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Cleaning me, he's purging me
And moving me around
He's bathing and he's cleaning me
And moving me around
Around, and around and around and around
Washing me, cleaning me
Moving me around
He's purging me, he's been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around
And around

Around
And around
Moving me around
Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancies, maybe
You know, honey, I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Just wait until the sun shines through
Smile, my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too

Instrumental-first two lines of second verse

Smile, my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too
Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of May
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

They say "Emily, Emily, Emily"
And we fade to a marvellous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualise a family
They see dreamily, Emily

[Instrumental break]

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualise a family
They see dreamily, Emily
You should do it while you can
Don't let it go, don't let it go
You should hold her while you can
Don't let her go, don't let her go
INTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors?

PAUL: No.

GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day’s Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won’t make us feel as though we’re actors. But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film.

RINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it. 

[laughs] You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.

PAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.

RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We’d sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it’s about the grandfather in the film who goes off to—

RINGO: Well, we can’t tell you, ‘cause we’ll ruin the film, you see!

PAUL: We can’t tell you 

[inaudible] but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It’s all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it’s not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he’s sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor! 

[laughter] And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!” 

[sound of arms flapping; laughs] Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.

RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.

PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. 

[laughs]
RINGO: Yeah.

PAUL: They cut some of it.

RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.

And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar

Today I saw the sun
To rise to fall but can you forgive me
I sail upon this mortal storm
And hearts that cry and love is to leave me

We're miles apart
I know my aim is true
It keeps this flame from dying
I just stay alive

Angel of mercy
I know that I'll find you
So it's to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away

The voice is on the wind
I steal the stars, the course I must follow
No space or time, no sleep the soul
It lies awake, it craves to be near you

It drives me on
I know my aim is true
It keeps my flame from dying
We might live again
Angel of mercy
I know that I'll find you
So it's to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away

Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever

Write a letter in the sand
That only lovers understand
And when the words are said and done
That we must come together

Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever

[Verse 1]
Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done

[Verse 2]
Comes a fire, firemen come and rescue me
Blow a tire, you can patch the innertube
But comes love, nothing can be done

[Chorus 1]
Don't try hiding
'Cause it isn't any use
You'll just start sliding
When your heart turns on the juice

[Verse 3]
Comes a heat wave, you can hurry to the shore
Come a summons, hide yourself behind a door
Comes love, nothing can be done

[Verse 4]
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

[Verse 5]
Comes the measles, you can quarantine a room
Comes a mousie, you can chase it with a broom
Comes love, nothing can be done

[Chorus 2]
That's all, brother
If you've ever been in love
That's all, brother
Then you know just what I'm speaking of

[Verse 6]
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you could get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
My shawl, pretty lady, try it on you

It's glory, with the story of love dreams, old but new
My shawl brings a romance, maybe for you

I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart
And even if the world grows cold

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra, Choir]
Silent night (Silent night), holy night (Holy night)
All is calm (All is calm), all is bright (All is bright)
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra, Choir]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia (Alleluia)

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Verse 1]
First time I saw her
Thought that I would lose my mind
Just had to have her
I had to have her in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you make me feel
Is like no other feeling that I've had (I've ever had) before
You give the kind of lovin'

She's got me open all the time
She knows I'm never leavin'
Can't be wrong 'cause it feels so right
The way you make me feel

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you make me feel
Is like no other feeling that I've had (I've ever had) before
You give the kind of lovin'

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Bridge]
No one can do what you do
When you do what you're doin to me
And I can't believe can it be that it's me
That you're feelin'
It's ecstasy

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Bridge]
No one can do what you do
When you do what you're doin to me
And I can't believe can it be that it's me
That you're feelin'
It's ecstasy

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain so yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a young and a callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow--follow, oh-oh
Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow--follow, oh-oh

Deep in December it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
Without a hurt, the heart is hollow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made you mellow
Deep in December our hearts should remember
Then follow--follow, oh-oh Follow, oh-oh
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out?

You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We all doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait

You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head

You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right

You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right
You know it's gonna be
All right

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
Got myself an angel
Straight from the heavens above
And I'm truly, truly thankful (Thankful)
For having such a heavenly love

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
Just standing she's got it (Tell the world about it)
Found a four leaf clover (Feels good all over)
And I love her (And I love her)
Listen to me now, she's in love with me

[Chorus: The Temptations]
I got a girl, won't trade her for the world
'Cause nothing can match what she's worth
She's sweet as can be and she's crazy about me
I've got heaven right here on earth

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
She's got eyes, that sparkle like diamonds, yeah
Listen to me, she's got a heart
Talkin' about her heart, that's made of pure gold, woo

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
She's sugar and spice, baby (Everything nice)
Peaches and cream (The little, little things)
And I love her (And I love her)
I want to tell you that, she's in love with me

[Chorus: The Temptations]
I got a girl, won't trade her for the world
'Cause nothing can match what she's worth

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ye-ye-yeah)

[Verse 3: David Ruffion]
Whenever we go steppin' out
I can't tell you how proud I feel
Her beauty surpasses for Mona Lisa
Sometimes I can't believe she's real

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
She's a living dream (She's my protection)
From lonely nights (She's my protection)
And I love her (And I love her)
Listen to me, she's in love with me

[Outro: The Temptations]
Let me tell you 'bout a girl, won't trade her for the world
'Cause nothing can match what she's worth
She's sweet as can be and she's crazy about me
I've got heaven right here on earth
Listen to me now, I got a girl, won't trade her for the world
Listen, nothing can match what she's worth
She's sweet as can be and she's crazy about me
I've got heaven right here on earth
If you're lonely in the black of night
If you call me, I'll be there
I was falling and you helped me get it right
And I thank you girl, and I thank you

And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late

If you just come down
I can look you in the eye
I can tell you that I love you
And my love will never die
And it's time that you know
Just how far I mean to go
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon

Come tomorrow, candle burns
And I wake up by your side
All my sorrow, you made it disappear
And I thank you, and I thank you
And I lay down my life
And I won't be alone

If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon

And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late

If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
Chorus:
Neva gon' bounce, neva, neva gon' bounce
(never.... Say never) (3x)

Y'all bitches...
Get ya' mind right
Get'cha, get'cha mind right (7x)

1st verse:
I'm tryin' to do my thang like a rap star tryin' to
Stay clean, ache my hands, and avoid the game
But it's hard. 'cause I can ball dope and get paid
Like a muthafucker gotta be another way to pay
T. Tucker, used to roll twenties by the ounce (ounce)
My papa got a brand new mag it's called bounce
Crackers wanna label me a nigga man but I'm
A bigga man, I said fuck that or do go to trigga
Man. It's the new somethin' cream goin' round
It started in the saint town and now it move to
Ghost town. Said tonight was time but where
Your gat? Niggas get wild when they hear
Botty-at, booty-at. You bitches tryin' to pussy-pop
Dealin' herb, slung tapes ten dollas a rock
Ya gotta take what you need, take what you
Want, slingin' tapes out the club and tapes
Out the trunk. When the trigga man bails soft
Take'em to the saint tell him rock another block
Party. Dj irv had that shit bumpin', T. T. Tucker
Had the dance floor jumpin', whole project
Full of hoes (come on, go T. T., go T. T., go). But
If a nigga jumps stupid I'm blast ya' (who put this
Fuckin' thing together?) me, that's me that's who
I told you don't fuck with me
Chorus

2nd verse:
Oooh, see I'm the one that you talkin' bout. Drop
A little red tape and a stone in the sword, and my
Pocket got swoll from insurance. I bought a
Little more gold and fucked a lotta' more hoes!
All them bitches know what's up (how they know
How they know?) they heard me on the radio
Buddah I set up. Where-he-at hittin' dead home
If it wasn't bumpin' in your ride it was bumpin' in
Your headphones. No it ain't gone to my head
'cause I ain't gon' let it, damn it feel good gettin'
Sweated, huh, huh, huh. Uptown, downtown
Cross the river, don't matter 'cause I'm the nigga
The nigga nigga, the nigga nigga. One brick
Object (what happened?) couldn't keep my
Muthafuckin' ass out that project. Shit, that's
When it happened (what up?) 5-0 busted in
There was a raid and I was captured

1st bridge:
Alright, all you niggas on the floor right now
Down! Get out the way!
Ay man, why you fuckin' wit' me?
I'm the fuckin' boss, I put this shit together
I tol' you that 

[punch], shut the fuck up, I
Don't give a fuck who you are get your ass
Down on the floor!
Chorus

2nd bridge:
Man calm down, calm down
Yo T. T. Don't trip (for real?), 'cause when them
Laws let you loose boy we gon' handle this
See you gonna get your shot at limelight, but
In the meantime in between time keep your
Mind right. (but man they said that I was
Wanted) for what? (narcotics, homicide
Shoplifting warrant, so much shit I can't finish.)
This call concludes this minute. 

[dial tone]
(hello? , hello? Bitch, you gon' hang up on
Me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Alright (21x)

Chorus

Shake that ass, never gonna....
Hey little darlin', come down and see
A high standard of living just ain't for me
Just ain't for me
So tell me somethin', why can't you see?
You're a natural villain, stay far from me
Stay far from me
Start trying to treat me the way I wanna be
Start trying to treat me the way I wanna be
Stop trying so hard
And start trying to make it better baby
Start trying to make it better baby

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
And then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river that I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

[Verse 2]
She tried hard to help me, you know, she put me at ease
And she loved me so naughty, she made me weak in the knees
I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I've ever had
And I wish I had a river that I could skate away on

[Chorus]
Oh, I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

[Outro]
It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
Yes, away on

[Chorus]
Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Oh won’t  you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back(I want you back), ooh-ooh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Oh-woah-oh
Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Won’t  you please let me
Back in your heart?
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
Ooh-ooh baby
Maybe it's been so long
Our house looks kind of different
But the empty rooms still mean the same to me
And as I wander through the darkness
I'll keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
I'll kiss your memory

I'll kiss your memory
As though you were here
I'll hold your memories till you reappear
And as I wander through the darkness
I'll keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
I'll kiss your memory

I'll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over
And I'll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me
And I will wander through the darkness
I'll keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
I'll kiss your memory
I'll kiss your memory
As though you were here
I'll hold your memories till you reappear
And as I wander through the darkness
I'll keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
I'll kiss your memory
I hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair
I hate these striplights they're not so undoing as your stare
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I wanna do is tear
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here

[Chorus]
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm
You have this expression dear no words could take its place
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face

[Chorus]
I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls
If you'll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss
If you don't know what is wrong with me
Then you don't know what you've missed
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess
And a handful of eagerness says "What do you suggest?"

[chorus
Thanks to you
I've got a reason to get outta bed make a move or two
Thanks to you
There's a net below cause otherwise well I don't know
And thanks to you
There are promises of laughs and loves and labyrinths
And reason to suspect that I'm meant for this
A smile a song a tender kiss
Thanks to you

Thanks to you
There's a thing I think I know
I really mean or variations on that theme
Thanks to you
I have time to turn time to cool and time to burn
And thanks to you
There's something suddenly too good to miss
In other words a way through this
And just when one might feel so perfectly alone
There's someone else's stuff to trip on besides ones own
Thanks to you
One can only guess what happens next
As it is I balk and stumble through a world gone quite absurd
Dodging shadows lurching through the rain
I'm not complaining but I'm caught
With or without you I'd have to get through this anyway

So where does the genius go when business is slow
And even dreaming has a way of scheming to get you down
Likely off at some chateau so how would he know
It gets as lonely up there as anywhere
Where moving over to make room once seemed impossible
It's not impossible
That one handed applause
That unspoken word
That treefall in the forest someone finally heard
Thanks to you

So I made her say, "Ah, Ah Ah"
Now she got her hands on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)

[Verse 1]
Papa's faith is people
Mama she believes in cleaning
Papa's faith is in people
Mama she's always cleaning
Papa brought home the sugar
Mama taught me the deeper meaning

[Verse 2]
She don't like my kick pleat skirt
She don't like my eyelids painted green
She don't like me staying up late in my high-heeled shoes
Living for that rock 'n roll dancing scene
Papa says "Leave the girl alone, Mother
She's looking like a movie queen"

[Verse 3]
Mama thinks she spoilt me
Papa knows somehow he set me free
Mama thinks she spoilt me rotten
She blames herself but Papa he blesses me
It's a rough road to travel
Mama let go now, it's always called for me

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I get that feeling
And I want to settle and raise a child up with somebody
I get that strong longing
And I want to settle and raise a child up with somebody
But it passes like the summer
I'm a wild seed again, let the wind carry me
You may not be an angel, `cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along, I'll string along with you
I'm looking for an angel, to sing my love so to
And until the day that ones along, I'll string along with you
For every fault that you have, say, I've got three or four
The human little faults that you do have, just make me love you more
You may not be an angel but still I'm sure you'll do
So until the day that one comes along, I'll string along with you
I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your hand
I'll do anything to keep you satisfied
And I'll love you more than anybody can

And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
Leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime

I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the tears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes

And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
A picture of the joy that is mine
The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime

I'll walk in the rain by your side
I'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
I'll do anything to help you understand
And I'll love you more than anybody can
And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
The leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
What can I do to prove it to you that I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do

I was so wrong, right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you?

I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry?

Baby I'm so, I'm sorry
Got to prove that I'm so sorry

I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
What can I say dear, what can I do?
What can I say, what can I do
After I say I'm sorry?
Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you g

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you to be happy
You to have the best of things
To be down with me, baby
'cause your lovin', it's so good

You're giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby don't you know
That I'm down until the day I die
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you
Now you know i'll never do anything to hurt you
'cause baby I love you
Every night and day I pray
Your love returns
Oh I'd give my life
If it would only make you happy

Rap (notorious B. I. G)
Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'
Spittin' in faces in public places
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with amanda
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said
Poppa doin' this, poppa doin' that
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her word like the koran
Ya'll stay friends, i'll stay and smoke phil benzs
Honeysuckle sets, biggie secret pyjama sets
You were the reebok vandal, now you were chanel sandals
I made you - why would I play you?
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home

Chorus
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
Baby everything you want it for baby
You to be down with me
So give me that ass back baby
'cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you g

Chorus
Don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
Yes don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll smother you with kisses
When her birthday comes around
But as soon as she gets her presents
She'll down talk you all over over town
No don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

She'll beg you for clothes and diamonds
Until you're all in hock
And then you'll come home one mornin'
And your key won't fit the lock
Don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
Well, one day she'll say that she loves you
The next day she'll throw you in the street
She'll call you every mornin'
Every mornin' noon and night
She'll call you in between times
Just to see if you're doin' alright
She'll ask to borrow five
And then she'll beg for ten
And baby that five and ten
You won't ever see again!

Man don't ever trust a woman
Until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you
And the next day she'll throw you in the street

[Chorus]
I am a witness for the prosecution of a hate in this love affair
I who am guilty of nothing but always wantin' to be there

[Verse 1]
Mama, I swear I love you, I always have
In school I once traded chairs
If I couldn't be near you, I wanted what was yours
Now I just want you to care

[Chorus]
I am a witness
Witness
I am a witness for the prosecution of a hate in this love affair
Whatever it is you think that I did
You're wrong, I wouldn't even dare
'Cause you know I am a witness for the prosecution of a hate in this love affair
Witness for the prosecution
Yes I am

[Chorus]
Don't you know I am, I am a witness, witness
Witness for the prosecution

Oh, I swear by heaven I love you, I always have
In school I once traded chairs
If I couldn't be near you, I wanted what was yours
Now I just want you to care

[Outro]
I am a Witness for the prosecution of a hate in this love affair, yes I am
Witness for the prosecution

Witness for the prosecution of hate in this love affair
Witness

Witness for the prosecution
Guilty, seven years hard labor, take him away!
I told you that I loved you, you said that is so good
I called you my darlin', I thought I always would
But now you've gone and left me, I don't know what to do
So my little darlin', I write these words to you

You dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat
You just sorta stomped on my aorta
You started going out with guys, I felt us drift apart
And every step you took was a stomp upon my heart

I only hope that someday, you get them low down blues
In some smokey honky tonk, you looked down at your shoes
You'll think about that tender heart that you crushed beneath them soles
With your clod bustin' stompers, you left my heart so full of holes

You dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat
You just sorta stomped on my aorta
You started going out with guys, I felt us drift apart
And every step you took was a stomp upon my heart
Every step you took was a stomp
Upon my heart
Do I know your friend who?at a club?
Who was there? girl I wouldn't
Wait a minute, calm down
I was at the club with who?
Get tha f**k...man, u know what

Girl Im not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame
I call no names, real talk
See girl, only thing im trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk
Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sitting in VIP smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl

Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this

How the f**k she knew I was with them other girls then
When the whole club packed wait a minute let me finish what I've got to say
I've been with you five years and you listening to your motherf**king girlfriends
I dont know why you f**k with them all jealous no man havin ass hoes anyway
Real talk
Alway accusing me of some old bullshit when Im just trying to have a good time
Robert you did this, Kells I heard you did that
Dont you think i got enough bullshit on my mind
Real talk, hold hold up
Didn't I just give you money to go get yours hair, toes and nails done the other day, hmm
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Real talk, oh
Gave who some damn money?
I ain't gave nobody no damn money girl?

Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway
You gonna burn what?
Bitch I wish you would burn my motherf**king clothes
With your triflin ass, milton, you bogus girl, milton
Start your ....up and get ready to take me home
This bitch then lost her motherf**king mind
Down from the great white north, more than enough and then some
Swept her up on his horse, Tumbleweeds, we're meant to get stuck up on a fence
Heaven must have sent you, you've got no wire to roll against
Keep her steady cowgirl, don't let go of the reins
You are ready now girl, never mind the growing pains

Worlds out there are waiting, big and wild as the sky
No more hesitating, it's now or never, do or die

Keep her steady cowgirl, don't let go of the reins
You are ready now girl, never mind the growing pains

As hard as you imagined it being without me, we'll both be wishing it were that easy
Don't give me a pull, give me some room, when this round is through, I'll be coming back home
Wide open spaces between these two prairie hearts
Wondering where their place is in a world so far apart
Keep her steady cowgirl, don't let go of the reins
You are ready now girl, never mind the growing pains

[Verse 1]
This angel
Always the brightest
Oh surely will
Fall out of the nest
Conscious of the falsification
And the harnessing
Of our reality

[Chorus]
There'll be no return
No rapprochement
No conciliation
Wisdom will never come

[Bridge 1]
Constantly evolving, curious
Somber, obscure, dark and luminous
Vitriolic, stringent, prophetic

[Bridge 2]
He penetrated
The wheels of modern
Society that
He hated so so much
Hated with all his strength

[Verse 2]
The angel
Would never submit
For his eyes were
Wide open and lit
We brought oil
Where there was a fire
In this way for good
Were bound to the devil

[Chorus]
There'll be no return
No rapprochement
No conciliation
Wisdom will never come

[Bridge 3]
The tumbler stayed standing up
All of his life he flinched not

[Outro]
Surpassing of the art
Surpassing cinema
Surpassing life itself
Ding dong ding dong...
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarassed

(Mom and daddy says) Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do

I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper (wink, wink)
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter

(Mom and daddy says) Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy

Where it had been left hundreds of years ago?
Extract from the depth is but a setting sun
Paradise is scarce in this light that won't shine
What is our earthly task but a worthy design?

Some held it in sight for scattered it may have been
They're ready to fight in a priceless inkling
The request is here ready to resurrect
What else can we do but recover the project
Our earthly design can be so detached
What crushes our desire not to be trapped?
When the higher spheres tell us to and not to
Everyone agrees demanding more veto
Our earthly design can we be so detached
What crushes our desire not to be trapped?
Okay

Oh, it's a long, long time from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
He was not in this county
He was forty miles away

But they took him 'cross the mountain
And they whomped him on the hill
Yes, they took him on the mountain
And they whomped him on the hill
It was there that he pleaded
Oh, please, let me make my will

But Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
He was not in this county
He was forty miles away
But they took him down to Danville
And they throwed him in jail
Yes, they took him down to Danville
And they throwed him in jail
And it was then nobody sought him
Nobody could go his bail

But Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
He was not in this county
He was forty miles away

But they took him out at midnight
And they strapped him to a tree
Yes, they took him out at midnight
And they strapped him to a tree
It was there that they killed him
With rifle bullets three

But Hiram Hubbard was not guilty
Lord, I heard a great many say
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I heard a great many say
He was not in this county
He was forty miles away

[Intro]
So you think I should buy you a car?
Why, because Elvis did?
Darlin' come on

[Verse 1]
Because Elvis gave 'em cars, you think I'm cheap
And you're hard done by
Look, you live here like a star, rent-free suite
Big blue pool that you sun by

[Pre-Chorus]
Trips to tropic shores
Clothes from fancy stores
You want too much, you want too badly
You want everything for nothing

[Verse 2]
Going to the church
You chant for my downfall
Chanting for my house, my friends
You want it all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The pillows on my bed
The visions in my head
You want too much, you want too badly
You want everything for nothing

[Chorus 1]
In the land of litigation
The courts are like game shows
Take what's behind the curtain, the jury cries
I'm not going to be the jackpot
At the end of your perjured rainbow
Not if local justice has even one good eye

[Verse 3]
Oh it's not like I was blind, I saw
But I took no action
As you began to climb, green-clawed
Dissatisfaction

[Pre-Chorus 3]
It wasn't hard to guess
That the end would be a mess
You want too much, you want too badly
You want everything for nothing

[Chorus 2]
In the land of mass frustration
The judges are sleeping
Counting wooly little lawyers and grinding their teeth
Outside my sleepless window
The Hollywood sirens are shrieking
While down some search-lit alley runs some lost belief

[Verse 4]
Oh I'm tangled in your lies, your scam
Your spider web
Spit spun between the trees, doors slam
You want my head

[Pre-Chorus 4]
You'd eat your young alive
For a Jaguar in the drive
You lie too much, you lie too badly
You want everything for nothing

I was granted the opportunity to holla at Mr. Quarters about his upcoming album

You know, I been, I've been thinking about doin' this shit since, you know, back when I was forty, so I figured "Hey fuck it. I'm a go ahead and just do the damn thing, just go ahead and do the damn thing."

Ya'll feel that? Feel that nigga

Now feel that fuckin' nigga!
Hey, ya'll holla back at a muthafucker and you know what I'm always sayin nigga:
If you can't earn no muthafuckin' cents, you better beg for the quarter
Yes your talkin' about your woman
Wish to god, man, you could see mine
Your talkin'about your woman
Wish to god, man, you could see mine
When she start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind

Her daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
When she start walkin'
The deaf and dumb begin to talk

I remember one Friday morning
We were layin' down across the bed
Man was in the next room dyin'
Knelt down and raised up his head
And said ain't she pretty
The world know she's fine
She start lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
Hey, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, I declare my baby's pretty
The whole state knows she's fine
Oh, when she starts lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
I've got a wreck of emotion
I have a terrible notion fixed on you
And everything you do
I made a magical potion
Of perfect words and the ocean, for you
I hope you think it's cool
I've been waiting for the longest time
I've been waiting for the longest time
I've been waiting for the longest time for you
I'm sick of all this commotion
A glance of eyes from across the room
Has me dragged on for so many week now
I've been waiting for the longest time
I've been waiting for the longest time
I've been waiting for the longest time for you
It's very far away
It takes about half a day
To get there, if we travel by my a.....dragonfly

No, it's not in Spain
But all the same
You know
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right

Hang on, my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's a really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic

The clouds are really low
And they overflow
With cotton candy
And battle grounds
Red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time
On bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

I woke up this morning
There were tears in my bed
They killed a man I really loved
Shot him through the head

Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground

Sent him off to prison
For a seventy dollar robbery
Closed the door behind him
And they threw away the key

Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground

He wouldn't take shit from no one
He wouldn't bow down or kneel
Authorities, they hated him
Because he was just too real
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground

Prison guards, they cursed him
As they watched him from above
But they were frightened of his power
They were scared of his love

Lord, Lord, so they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground

Sometimes I think this whole world
Is one big prison yard
Some of us are prisoners
The rest of us are guards

Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground

You may be rich
You may be poor
You may be high
Or you just may be low
But if you fall in love
Oh, and you should lose
A woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues

Wo, you may be young
You may be old
Maybe you've heard
Or maybe you've never been told
If you've got a good woman
Oh, try not to misuse
Oh, a woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues

She'll make you hot in the winter

Make you cold in the summertime
She'll make you feel young in the spring
And in the fall drive you out of your mind
A woman, don't you hear me callin' you?
Yeah woman, you don't care
Yeah, you don't care who you give the blues

Oh, you may be up
You may be down
You may be short, tall, skinny
Or you just might be round
Oh, don't be too sure of your woman
Thinkin' man, that you can't lose
Oh, remember that a woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues

[Intro]
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long

[Verse 1]
Before you get into the shower
Before you worry about your hair
Baby give me one more hour
I want you to stay right there
I dont wanna lose a moment
I dont wanna miss a kiss
If i could plan the perfect day, love
Then i would start it just like this

[Chorus]
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning

[Verse]
Now baby how can i convince you
I'll make it so you can't resist
Whatever else you have to do now
It can't be half as good as this
I'll chase you underneath the sheets, love
And i won't let you get away
The day won't be complete, love
Unless we get a chance to say

[Chorus]
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning

[Bridge]
Open your eyes
See my son rise
I feel you're skin
So warm inside
Day breaks so sweet
When you're next to me
So stay each night
So each morning will be

[Chorus]
Before We Start The Day Dear
Im Whispering in your ear
Let's get lost together
I will smile forever
Was morning
Like a fish gets caught on a hook
You'll go for a line, get hit with the book
Like cop puts cuff on a crook
Baby, you'll get yours

Like a clown falls down from a slap
You'll fall for sweet talk and know you're a sap
Like a bear walks right in a trap
Baby, you'll get yours

Like Eve who tricked old Adam
Had to pay the cost
A great Voice boomed
And said, "Madam, get lost"

Like a spider spins a web and waits for a fly
You'll fall for it, gent some hard-hearted guy
When he walks out with slim goodbye
Watch those swinging doors
'Cause you'll get yours
Just like Eve who tricked old Adam
She had to pay the cost
A great Voice boomed
And said, "Madam, get lost"

Like a spider spins a web and waits for a fly
You'll fall for it, gent some hard-hearted guy
When he walks out with slim goodbye
Watch those swinging doors
'Cause you'll get yours

[Verse 1:]
Alone in a room
It's just me and you
I feel so lost
'Cause I don't know what to do
Now what if I choose the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you

[Chorus:]
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life is so cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart
Oh yeah

[Verse 2:]
My hopes and dreams
Are fading fast
I'm all burned out
And I don't think my strenghts gonna last
So I'm crying out
Crying out to you
Lord I know that you're the only one
Who is able to pull me through

[Chorus:]
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life seems so cloudy
Lord guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart

[Bridge:]
So show me how
To do things your way
Don't let me make the same mistakes
Over and over again
Your will be done
And I'll be the one
To make sure that it's carried out
And in me I don't want any doubt
That's why...

[Chorus:]
I need to talk to you, yes I do
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life seems just a little bit cloudy
Lord you can guide me through
Thats why I open up
I open up my heart, my heart
My heart, my heart
All I need to do is hear a single word from you
I open up my heart
Just one word could make a difference in what I do, Lord
(Guide until I'm sure)
I open my heart to you
You just say one word, one word, one word
One word, one word, one word
I open up my heart to you

You're the lover of my soul
Captain of my sea
I need a word from you
That's why I open up my heart
There's strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men that toil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge that
I cremated Sam McGee

Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows
Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows
He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in hell."

On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail
You talk of your cold! Through the parkas fold it stabbed like a driven nail
If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee

And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow
And the dogs were fed, and the stars overhead were dancing heel and toe
He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."
Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:
"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone
Yet it ain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."

Well, a pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
And we started on at the break of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale
And he crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;
And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee

With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, I hurried, horror-driven
There wasn't a breath in that land of death, because of a promise given; It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: "You may tax your brawn and brains
But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate my last remains."

Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code
In the days to come, though my lips were numb, in my heart how I cursed that load
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed that thing

And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
And the trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;
And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin

Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a thrice it was called the "Alice May."
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;
Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my crematorium."
Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you never did see;
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee

Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky

I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
But the stars came out and they danced about before again I ventured near;
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peek inside
I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; ... then the door I opened wide

And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—
And since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, this is the first time I've been warm."

There's strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who toil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge that
I cremated Sam McGee
I'm feelin sexy
I want to hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

The way your body moves across the floor
You got me feelin n-a-s-t-why
I might just take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel your energy
The vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin so crazy babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Intro]
Haha, liar
A one, two, a one, two, three

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
This thing (This thing)
Called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (Woo, woo)
It jives (Woo, woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride
On my motorbike, until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love (Oh)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get, get on my tracks
Take a back seat (Ah-hum), hitch-hike (Ah-hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready

[Outro]
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, oh
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, oh
Crazy little thing called love, oh
Ooh
High rise blocks out the blue
The pavement sticks like glue
You're getting nowhere
Hitch a ride on a wing and a prayer

When you're crying out loud
A face lost in the crowd
A voice no-one can hear
You'll get by on a wing and a prayer

So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will...

Go. Rain, thunder, blowing down
(You better believe it, love is everywhere)
(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)
Feels like you're gonna drown
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
Reach out, no one's there
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
Just hold on to a wing and a...
Prayer. Like smoke in the air
(It's just a little homegrown philosophy)
(Take it or leave it, it comes for free)
You'll slowly slip away
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
All senses prevail
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
You'll fly home on a wing and a prayer

So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go

Now you walk that high wire
(You better believe it, love is everywhere)
(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)
In truth you'll want to fly
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
You'll fly everywhere
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
If you trust to a wing and a prayer

So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing
It's just a little homegrown philosophy
Take it or leave it, it comes for free
If you trust to a wing and a prayer

You better believe it, love is everywhere
And if you can feel it, you're halfway there
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing
If you trust to a wing and a prayer

Just a little homegrown philosophy
Take it or leave it, it comes for free
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
...

[Verse 1]
Strangely beautiful
Beautiful strange
That's what we said
Instead of the name
If you count the times
He took all the blame
You would find the reason
Behind the game
Beautiful strange

[Verse 2]
In the darkness
We must look for the way
Words so strange
That only the mind can say
If it makes no mind
What color or holy day
Why is this game
The only one that we play
Beautiful strange

[Non-lyrical Vocalizing]

[Verse 3]
Dive inside your soul if you wanna know
The light inside the darkness forever glows
The sun is like the diamond inside the coal
And like an embryo it grows and grows and grows and grows
Beautiful strange

[Outro]
Oh, beautiful strange
Beautiful strange
Beautiful strange
Oh
Beautiful strange
Hey!
(Pharrell)
Love was the egg see...
And it was born in a cloud with silver lining. (Unhun)
But it broke,I mean it hatched on the ground so time flew right by me...and walaa

(Chorus)
I know you thought your life was gon be easy when you didn't call, you found out you were wrong.See I know you thought your life was gon be easy you thought you had it all but you found out you were wrong.....See Maybe there was something wrong amd you weren't tellin' me nooo ohh .See See maybe the laughs on me and life was tellin me a jokee
Pharrell)

(Chorus)

Babee

[Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
If I had your number
I'd call you on the phone
I'd breathe a little heavy; if that didn't work, maybe I'd start to groan
I don't love you
I'm just a horny toad

[Verse 2]
I don't want your money
'Cause I got all I need
All I want is to rub your body until you start to bleed
I don't love you
I'm just a horny toad

[Verse 3]
If I had your address
I'd come right to your door
I'd knock all day till you let me in and then I'd knock some more
I ain't crazy
I'm just a horny toad

[Verse 4]
If you think I'm nasty
You ain't seen nothing yet
You see I'm the kinda brother that the more you scream, the nastier I get
I can't help it
I'm just a horny toad
Now watch me dance

[Verse 5]
Run, go tell your boyfriend
That his loving done got too old
Might as well pack his things and get his dead ass on the road
Tell him you live on a lily pad
With a horny toad
I never cared much for moonlight skies, I never wink at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light
I never went for after-glow, candle light on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park, shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark, that's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows on my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light
I know U've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
And if U just close the door
I would not be surprised
Even though I know U've heard it
These words I'm tryin' 2 say
I think the others only flirted
With the true meaning of always

U can say what U wanna
But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center of your heart
No, no
Heart (Heart)

I see the candle through your window
Burns there every night
The shadow leaves an innuendo
Of no one holding U tight
Many nights I've dreamt U near me
But awaken 2 U gone (Gone)
I know one day U'll hear me
I don't care how long
U can say what U wanna
But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center of your heart
Oh yeah

(Journey center of your heart)
Journey 2 the center of your heart
Heart

I've waited a lifetime, baby
Just 2 know your name
We've done everything in our minds
Let's stop the game (Let's stop it)
Even though I know U've heard
These words I'm tryin' 2 say
Somehow I think these others, they only flirted
With the true meaning of always

(U can say what U wanna)
Oh, U can say what U wanna
(But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2)
But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center ... (Heart)
(U can say what U wanna)
(But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center of your heart)
Heart, heart
(Heart) (repeat in BG)
Your heart (x3)

[Intro]
OKAY!
Fuck it, I don't care
The Appeal!
When I fucking came to this fucking country
All I had was a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1:]
We need more Ros, My bitches gettin' thristy
My words like New Years, Christmas came early, (BuRR!)
Got these bitches urling, my earring's perfect
My left pinkey finger rolling like George Gervin
My name ain't Ervin, but call me Magic
Abra Cadabra, top off the Phathom
458 Italia, first in the states, out of town plates, just to make it look great
I need a haircut, plus a carwash
I get out the car and they take their bra's off
See I fought the law and the fuckin law won
Came back on Appeal wanna new outcome
Overload your eardrumbs, hear it hear it come!
Income Income, go and get you sum
Say bye to the Bad guy, Wave bye to the Bad guy, Gucci Mane the bad guy
Yes, I am the Bad guy, Wave bye to the Bad guy

[Chorus:]
I came to this country with a dollar and a dream and a choppa and a team full of killas, what you mean?
Imma bad guy, bad guy from start til the end
Say hello to my little friend
I couldve been a doctor, shouldve been a lawyer
I go to court so much I couldve been my own employer
Imma die a dope boy, always been a hustla
Started off custom now I (Say hello to my little friend)

[Verse 2 - Bun B:]
.......

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I got 60 racks laying on the floor in magic city
Like Samuel L Jackson I think it's time for killing
I touched his wife titty and the nigga start tripping
That ain't proper etiquette you see the bitch stripping
AR-15 whipped his ass into pieces
Don't get it twisted think it's all about the pieces
And all about the bracelets
I'm still fighting cases
10 thousand for the glasses
Diamonds in they faces (BuRR, BuRR)
Your own blood taste it
We stomp you till you tasteless
My t-shirt ain't tailored...
You read what is said - bitch
Brick squad bossman off with you head - bitch
Run for the exit
They shooting inside here
Parking lot gun fight bodies outside here
Police best bet come with the riot gear
Soldiers down to die here
Move to America
Dollar and a dream and a donor picture, tear it up

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]
I know my street, that's where I live
I never take, I always give
They always leave me on the shelf
I live my life all by myself

My car ain't big, I can't go fast
And ev'ry drink I take's the last
I'm always tryin' to save my health
I live my life all by myself

Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me
I'm a man who stands alone
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be

So take your hand down off my chair
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there
And I ain't neve seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself

My car ain't big, I can't go fast
And ev'ry drink I take's the last
I'm always tryin' to save my health
I live my life all by myself
Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me
I'm a man who stands alone
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be

So take your hand down off my chair
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there
And I ain't never seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself

I live my life all by myself
Well she's walking
Through the clouds
To the circus life
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras moving
In a fairy tale
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

Lord when I'm sad
When I'm sad she comes to me
Her thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, it's alright, she says it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
I've got dust on my shoes
Need my crankcase drained
I've got dust on my shoes
Need my crankcase drained
Its been a mean dry spell
But I think its gonna rain

Well the storm clouds roll in
My dogs pulling on his chain
Well the storm clouds roll in
My dogs pulling on his chain
Its been a long dry spell
But I think its gonna rain
Let it rain now… now

When I look at my field
Everything is cracked and flayed
I say I look at my field
Everything is cracked and flayed
And then I wonder to myself
How much can a poor man take
If your well runs dry
You might loose your sugarcane
Mmmm that good sweet cane babe
If your well runs dry
You might lose your sugarcane
Mmm hmmm

Its been a mean dry spell
But I think its gonna rain
Its been a mean dry spell
But I think its gonna rain
Its been a mean dry spell
But I think its gonna rain
Two lives, two hearts, two souls who never part
We said, we would for life and that's why
Tonight I don't fear the end of the road 'cause I

I keep going, keep going
I keep going till we've run out of road
I keep going, keep going, yeah
I keep going till we've run out of road

I just wanna love you forever
So I keep going, keep going
Till we've run out of road, yeah

We lose, we win, we fall to get up again
We said, we'd love for life that's why tonight
I don't fear the end of the road 'cause I

I keep going, keep going
I keep going till we've run out of road
I keep going, keep going, yeah
I keep going till we've run out of road
I just wanna love you forever
So I keep going, keep going
Till we've run out of road

I said I love you and that's forever
I'm sure that we will survive

So I'll keep going, keep going
Keep going till we've run out of road
Keep going, keep going, yeah
I keep going till we've run out of road

'Cause I just wanna love you forever
And I just wanna love you forever

So I keep going, keep going
I keep going till we've run out of road
I keep going, keep going, yeah
I keep going till we've run out of road

'Cause I just wanna love you forever
And I just wanna love you forever, yeah
After it's all been said
The music spinning in our head
Can't forget the feeling of
The magic of that summer in love

Ooh, I wanna take you there
Do you wanna turn back the pages?
Memories and photographs
The world has changed
And yet the game
Is still the same

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time? Woah
The good times never have to end
And now's the time to let them happen again
We can have ourselves a blast
The good times, they aren't only in the past

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time?

And as the sun goes down
We raise a glass to kindness
To all the good times we shared

Isn't it time we get ready again?
Isn't it time we go steady again?

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time?

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Pink Floyd
Wish You Were Here
Shine On You Crazy Diamond I-IV
Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!
Yeah, listen to the lyrics
We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end
Not the world, but the age is ending
Ending, listen to the astrological message I'm sending
I'm sending, tell em
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God, changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically
The new testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God no lie
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun, that hangs on the cross of the zodiac
The zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time, two thousand years and that's a fact
It's called an age or a house in the zodiac
The twelve disciples, are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish or dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age, of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
And creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrryyy!)
Do you wanna go higher...
Part 1:
Blues has got me, there is teardrops in my eyes
Yes the blues has got me, there is teardrops in my eyes
Well dark is the night, since my baby said good-bye
Oh how I've suffered since my baby went away
Yes how I've suffered since my baby went away
And I've got that feeling that my baby's gone to stay
Take me back baby, forgive me for the wrong I've done
Yes take me back darling, forgive me for the wrong I've done
Well I know I love you, and you're the only one
Yes talk to me baby, call me on the telephone
Yeah talk to me baby, call me on the telephone
Yes the blues has got me, and I want my baby home
Yes if your baby love you, keep her home and treat her nice
Oh if your baby love you, you better keep her home and treat her nice
Well never mistreat a good woman, this is some doggone good advice
Part 2:
Yes it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face
Well it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face
I'm tellin' you people, no one else can ever take her place
Yes the doorbell is ringing, I know there must be somethin' wrong
Yes the doorbell is ringing, I know it must be somethin' wrong
Well looka here it's my baby, she's done changed her mind and come home
So hurry baby, come on in and close the door
Yes hurry baby, come on in and close the door
Let me put my arms around you baby, so my nights won't be dark no more

Plenty of time...yeah

No changing, it's mine
Sometimes you look, right, through
But all I see, is, all I see is you...yeah
I'm kind of like a train that just won't stop
Trying to put the key inside the lock
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not

Waiting for you to connect the dots
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not
Like me or not
I don't care if you lose my number, ain't gonna crumble, ain't gonna fall to the floor
I always got more...yeah
You can tell all your friends that I'm not your type, but if you don't try me, how can you be sure
Well how can you be sure
Sometimes you look right through
But all I see is, all I see is you...yeah
I'm kind of like a train that just won't stop
Trying to put the key inside the lock
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not
I ain't ever gonna lose this plot
Waiting for you to connect the dots
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not
Like me or not
Sometimes you just know
That you shouldn't let go
I'm kinda like a train that just won't stop, stop, stop
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not
I ain't ever gonna lose this plot
Waiting for you to connect the dots
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not
Writer(s): David/Evans/Altman

Daisy is darling, Iris is sweet
Lily is lovely, Blossom's a treat
Of all the sweethearts - a guy could meet
Well I finally chose an American beauty rose

Camelia's tragic, she can't be mine
Magnolia's magic, it makes Maggie shine
Laurel will hug you, Orchid's divine
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose

She's clingier than Ivy, and she's zingier than black-eyed Susan
And springier than Mabel in June
I'm daffy as a daffodil, it's laughable the way I thrill
When roses are in bloom

Pansy is pretty, Willow is tall
Violet's kisses, tulips (two lips) recall (Violet's kiss is Tulip's recall)
How can I choose one, I love 'em all
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose
Go 'way little boy
I'm not for you
Go back to her
Where you'll be more secure
She knows you better than I do
Go 'way little boy
I'm not for you
Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad
I don't wanna to see you bleed
She's the one that you need
You'll never miss what you ain't never had
Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad
Go 'way little boy
It's much too late
Walk back out the door
Don't wanna see you here no more
You're making it hard for me to concentrate
Go 'way little boy
It's much too late
Can't you hear your mama callin'
Don't you recognize her voice
I think you'd better heed her warning
While you still have the choice
Go 'way little boy
You're much too late
Your future's lookin' bright
Don't throw it away tonight
It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye
Go 'way little boy
Can't you see that you're makin' me cry
It's easy to say you love me
It's easy to just play the part
I want to believe you love me
But you can't fool my heart

You gave me a promise true dear
But somehow I knew from the start
That you'd never keep your promise
No, you can't fool my heart

I know you're just pretending
And the things you say are untrue
And I'm sure you'll soon be spending
Your love with somebody new

I don't have to keep pretending
I know that we're drifting apart
You might think you are fooling someone
But you can't fool my heart

I know you're just pretending
And the things you say are untrue
And I'm sure you'll soon be spending
Your love with somebody new
I don't have to keep pretending
I know that we're drifting apart
You might think you are fooling someone
But you can't fool my heart
No, you can't fool my heart

[Verse 1]
Frozen to the glass again
Out of our skins again
Cold I am, tonight I am
Tomorrow's really on my mind

Sure to think of, from now on
The things will move more slowly
But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams

[Chorus]
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

In this skyline

[Verse 2]
The past it almost shimmers now
All we needed, all we wished for
But here I am and safe am I
Trusting in an endless sky

[Chorus]
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

In this skyline

Skyline
Skyline
Skyline

[Verse 3]
Are things getting better now?
Are things getting worse?
But I'm standing in the sunshine
And it lifts my heart and feeds my mind

The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome is just another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the bay

Chorus: I left my heart in San Francisco, high on a hill it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care
My love waits there in San Francisco, above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco, your golden sun will shine for me
I'm chargin' 16 fever, 16 fever
Nigga, my price cheaper, 16 fever

Hoes ridin' vics dog but I ride beemers
I swear the red chain'll cost 16 fever

Hoes ridin' vics dog but I ride beemers

Fish scale sendin' my pigeons by mail

Lots of folks back east they say
"Hello" every day
Hitting the hard old dusty way to the California line
Across that desert sand they go
They're getting out of the old dust bowl
They think they're going to a sugar bowl
But here is what they find
Oh the police at the port of entry say
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"

And, well if you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is the garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not
You won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi

If you want a house or farm
That won't do nobody harm
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea
Don't swap that old cow for a car
Better stay right where you are
You had better take this tip from me
Cause I read it in the want ads every day
And the headlines on the papers always say
If you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is a garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not
You won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi

I'm gonna buy a paper doll, that I can call my own
A doll that other fellas cannot steal
And then the flirty, flirty guys - with all their flirty, flirty eyes
Will have to flirt with dollies, that are real

When I come home at night - she will be waiting
She'll be the truest doll in all this world
I'd rather have a paper doll, to call my own
Then have a fickle minded - real live girl

[Verse 1]
If you decide to make me blue, I'll be in trouble
If you decide to be untrue, I'll be in trouble
'Cause no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in trouble

[Verse 2]
If you decide one day you want to make a change, love
You want to leave me here and love a total stranger
Well, no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So if that's what you wanna do, I'll be in danger

[Bridge]
I'll do everything I can to make you stay
Keep you by my side (By my side)
'Cause I love you in such a way
I have to forget all about my pride

[Verse 3]
If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
If you decide you want to go, I'll be in trouble
I can't prepare myself and soul, I'll be in trouble
So no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway
So I just want you to know, I'll be in trouble

[Outro]
I'll be in trouble, (So much trouble)
If you ever leave me, baby (I'll be in trouble)
If you deceive me (So much trouble)
I must confess, (I'll be in trouble)
My life would be a mess (So much trouble)
I'll be in trouble, baby (I'll be in trouble)
So much trouble (So much trouble)
Hmmm, everyday, trouble (I'll be in trouble)
And everyway, so much trouble. (So much trouble)
Hmmm, baby (I'll be in trouble)
So much trouble (So much trouble)
Pain in my heart
Treatin' me poor
Where can my baby be
Lord, no one knows

Pain in my heart
Won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be
Lord, where is she

And one day
My days are gettin' tough
Won't you come back, come back, come back, baby
Lord

Pain in my heart
Won't let me be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I wake up restless night in misery
Lord

Won't somebody stop this pain
Lord, one day
My days are gettin' tough
Won't you love me, love me, love me, baby

Pain in my heart
Pain in my heart
Somebody stop this
Pain in my heart
It's killin' me baby
This pain in my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Pain in my heart
This pain in my heart
Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
And it doesnt show signs of stopping
And i've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dieing
And my dear is still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

And the fire is slowly dieing
And my dear is still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
I'm walking around in circles out of time
Spending out of focus like I lost my hand
Even though I know it's what you did
I'm not gonna show it

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Everytime you bruise me with your words
When you look right through me like you haven't heard
It doesn't really matter
Cause even though I'm shattered

You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry

Tear drops are frozen, in everything you had
I’m stuck in the moment, you're never getting back
Cause even though I'm shattered
You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try
You won't see me cry
You won't reach me, so don't try

Proving it, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
No, no, no, nooo

Closing in, shutting out, turning off this light
You won't see me cry
Walking around in circles out of time
I met her dancing to the Castle Rock
I held her tight and danced around the clock
We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock
She kissed me and I kissed my heart goodbye
I felt like I was drifting 'cross the sky
We rocked to heaven to the Castle Rock

Music was soft and low, setting me all aglow
Holding it to my heart, how could I dream we'd part
Suddenly she was gone, leaving me dreaming on
Now every time they play the Castle Rock
I'll take myself a walk around the block
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock
Go get 'em, Harry, for old time's sake

I met her dancing to the Castle Rock
I held her tight and danced around the clock
We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock
Now every time they play the Castle Rock
I'll take myself a walk around the block
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock

[Verse 1]
Hey you, don't you give up
It's not so bad
There's still a chance for us
Hey you, just be yourself
Don't be so shy
There's reasons why it's hard

[Chorus]
Keep it together, you'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, what ending would we do?
This could be good, hey you

[Verse 2]
Hey you, open your heart
It's not so strange
You’ve got to change this time
Hey you, remember this
None of it's real, including the way you feel

[Chorus]
Keep it together, we'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, will envy what we do
This could be good, hey you

[Post-Chorus]
Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, little brother
Hey you, save yourself
Don't rely on anyone else

[Bridge]
First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first

[Verse 3]
Hey you, there on the fence
You've got a choice
One day it will make sense
Hey you, first love yourself
Or if you can't
Try to love someone else

[Chorus]
Keep it together, we'll make it all right
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, will envy what we do
This could be good, hey you

[Bridge]
First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first
Another day is over and I'm on my way home
Knowing you'll be waiting is all I need to know

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy

Forget about my troubles
Forget about my woes
You're the one who comforts me
Whenever I feel low

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy
You're everything I could imagine
Fillin' me up with such passion
Eternity is not long enough for you and me

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood
Let's build a fire
Till the embers retire, we'll be
Lost, in a world of ecstacy

Rain falling from the skies
Like lonely tears through misty eyes
Rain streaming down my face
Brings memories my heart cannot erase

Here alone in all my sorrows
Waiting for the clouds to hurry by
Praying that a new tomorrow
Will put the sun back in the sky

Rain wash away my tears
So when that sun appears
I'll see my love again

[Chorus]
Stork patrol, we're patrolling
Stork patrol, he's rolling
Stork patrol with my storkies
Stork patrol

[Verse 1]
Yo, what up fine-feathered stork? Peace, you're lovely
Hollow legs, long beak, feathers so cuddly
Yo I want to step to ya stork but I don't know how
Your style's mad intimidating, makes me go wild
Get you open like those webbed toes, you know I spread those
Scrawny bird legs past the head when I bed those
Steaky seed stork steady salty in your seed sack
How about this barnacle, bird? you know I need that
Your feathers shiny, nasty plumage
Let me probe your inner sanctum, I love you doin' it
With your storking ass, beautiful Marabou
Plenty of birdseed for you, incubators too
What up, feathered boo boo? Don't I recognize you?
National Geographic cover '92
Turn around your backyard I can barely speak
Oops, there go my kids all over your beak

[Chorus]
Callin' all storks, we're on a stork patrol

[radio] we have an APB out for three storks heading...
Chicks fly the coop when you pull up to them birds
You are a beautiful specimen
A beautiful specimen

[Verse 2]
Hey yo big 

[?], I know you love Victoria's Egret
Garter belt all on your your claws on some freakish
I love you like my wingspan, everything's grand
Knock it airborne make you pray to god to bring land
Never worry about what your friends say, they're just pelicans
Swallowing the minnows of this other species' gentlemen
Thirty days, thirty nights on my eggs you sitted
'Cause you've always been committed till the day I was acquitted
Lovely, eatin' baby crocodiles and insects
Let me be your park ranger and your sanctuary 

[?]
Ooh, I want to ruffle you up, suck on your beak
Freak nasty-ish, make you stand on one feet
Yo, my eyes are red and my voice is trembling
Please don't leave me, stork; these days I need you till the end
When the cops came, you held my stash in your beak
God damn, nasty freak

[Outro]
Alright listen up stork
Three human men have got you surrounded
Now come outside and marry one of us
Oh Judy, do you hear me call your name
Oh Judy, do you really feel the same
Oh Judy, if I were you I'd take the blame
Judy, it's gettin' stronger every day

Oh Judy, I felt it's you in every way
My Judy, that's why you're always here to stay
I love you so
I want you to know

I can't let you
Give me a chance to show
Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear

Then Judy, tell me that you really care
Well Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Please Judy, tell me that you really care
She believes in god
And karma too
Paranormal powers
You know some people do
Got scorpio risin'
Uh huh
Tell you what's in your stars
She was down in rio
Turn the heads of state
Got 'em into makin'
This planet a better place
On copacabana
Uh huh
Oh yeah she radiate better go meditate
Everytime i touch my baby
Strange things happen
Strange things happen
Everytime i touch my baby
Strange things happen to me

Oh ohhh ohhhh

[Verse 1: Jim Paciulli]
I flow nicely, you know who I be
Last name Paciulli, aka Jimmy G
Be a rotten Crab Apple underground MC
And I do this all for love so I rhyme for free
And that's just fine with me
So let me tell you a lil' somethin' about my family tree
I got roots from Italy, not Germany or Ireland
Fuck guns, it's all deadly lyrics that I'm firin'
My kids don't listen, to what the Don say
They rattle the whole enclave like Dante
From The Last Don did, grab a L, then I'm
Rollin' chronic, gotta get the bomb lit son
I smoke so much I got a call just to get off
At the hospital they spray my lungs to get shit off

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Model number 051-664795
Unidentified flyin' classified surveillance
Sweatin' paranoia fluids and juices produces
A liquid army of Battlecats
With pins in they hand
This world's a notebook
I left my last thoughts on South America
Visualizin' galaxies and starin' at stars
And thinkin' how my next verse might be
Written on Mars or Jupiter
Most cats got cataracts in they third eye
That's why I
Try to focus mine
With the bird's eye perspective
Act like a ghetto child and get neglected
Or like my fifth grade teacher disrespected
Now I'm on point, and Ritalin gets all the credit
Computer chips
Underneath my skin so I'mma shed it
That's why I
Stay focused, my word is birth 'cause I deliver it
Lyrical M-I-C-section induced by injections of Ritalin

[Intro]
I want everybody to get up off your seat
And get your arms together and your hands together
And give me some of that old soul

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
I been workin' graveyard shifts eight days and no breaks
This ain't livin', somethin's missing
Friday night the weekend's here, it's right on time
I'm on a mission for somethin' different (Come on, come on)
Ain't no time to waste, girl, it's gettin' late
Let's show them what we can do
My work is done, the weekend's just for fun
Get out of your seat and let's move

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]
I've been down and back and forth and side to side
Now you're groovin', let's keep it movin'
All around the world, let's get down tonight
You gotta use it before you lose it, hey hey
Don't forget to treat each day as if it were the last
Life's too short for the blues
Get your light to the fire
Get this party started right
It's time to break all of the rules

What y'all came to do?
Put on your dancin' shoes (Hey)

[Outro: Aretha Franklin & John Legend]

Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head

I'd tried to tell the woman
But she doesn't believe a word I said
Go light pretty baby...
Gonna need my help some day
It's all right pretty baby...
Gonna need my help some day

You're gonna wish you listened
To some of those things I said

Go ahead pretty baby
Oh, honey knock yourself out
Go ahead pretty baby
Oh honey knock yourself out

I still love you baby
Cause you don't know what it's all about
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
I am the son of a grassland farmer
Western Oklahoma nineteen forty three
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free
I gave up my father to South Korea
The mind of my brother to Vietnam
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil
Four generations of love on this farm
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm

What are we making weapons for
Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

I had a son and my son was a soldier
He was so like my father, he was so much like me
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be
He gave up his future to revolution
His life to a battle that just can't be won
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old
What are we making weapons for
Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner
A slave to the ways of the powers that be
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other
What does it take for a people to learn
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn

What are we making weapons for
Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

Have we forgotten
All the lives that were given
All the vows that were taken
Saying never again
Now for the first time
This could be the last time
If peace is our vision
Let us begin
Have we forgotten
All the lives that were given
All the vows that were taken
Saying never again, never again
Now for the first time
This could be the last time
If peace is our vision
Let us begin, let us begin

Cannot prevent the Snow Goose following him
Out across the channel and left into the heart of

College degree
.....

[Verse 1]
It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place 'cept you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know

We're drinkin' my friend to the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Verse 2]
I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feelin' so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad?

I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Bridge]
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't you listen to me
Till it's talked away?

[Verse 3]
Well, that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear

But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Outro]
The long, it's so long
The long, very long

[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You try to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 1]
Wish that I could wind
Like a spiral stair through time
To your body next to mine
Warm and satisfied
Wish that I could catch
A night train to the past
Climb aboard and hear you ask
Darling, come inside

[Chorus]
Memories, memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Of days gone by
That make me cry
Memories, memories
Sweet memories
That make me sad
They take me back to you
Memories, memories
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

[Verse 2]
Watching falling stars
On the grass by my own car
Making love there in the dark
Thinking we're alone
Old man shined his light
Trying not to act suprised
He left hard and all uptight
Told us to get on home

[Chorus]
Ooh, memories, memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Of love we shared
Of love we shared
Memories, memories
Sweet memories
Of love we shared
We will never
Share them again
Memories memories
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

[Verse 3]
Wish that I could wind
Like a spiral stair through time
To your body next to mine
Warm and satisfied
Wish that I could catch
A night train to the past
Climb aboard and hear you ask
Darling, come inside

[Outro]
Ooh, memories, memories
Sweet, sweet memories
Of days gone by
You made me cry, baby
Memories, memories
Sweet memories
That make me sad
They take me back to you
Memories, memories
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
To you, baby, to you, to you, you, you, you, you, ah
Memories, memories
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
There's no end to our love
Our hopes our dreams our sighs
No end at all, no sad goodbyes
No fears, no tears, no love that dies

It's senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
Never-ending
The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever

All we are and all we know
Is love and love alone and so
The world may spin its weary way
Its lonely night and lonely day
While we go floating far above
In never-ending timeless love, it's senza fine
All we are and all we know
Is love and love alone and so
The world may spin its weary way
Its lonely night and lonely day
While we go floating far above
In never ending timeless love, it's senza fine

Let it always be senza fine
Never ending
The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever
Girls it's been my pleasure
To know quite a lot of you
And in the main
You're pretty sane, it's true
But there are a few who do to
Doo ti doo too beautiful a job
It isn't quite what they planned
When the man gets the upper hand
He's takin' her for a ride
I'd call it suicide

If when she tries to run away
And he calls her back, she comes
If there's a next time, he's okay
Cause she's under both his thumbs
She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide

She loves to ride in big parades
But he wouldn't so she won't
She needs at least a dozen maids
But if he says no she don't
He wishes she knew his side
Soon there'll be trouble brewin' I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide
Suicide, she's commitin' it
Suicide, he's not gettin' it
Suicide, it's a quittin' a day

She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide
Would you annihilate us if you had the chance?
That's such an anti-social thing to do
You've got us crapping our collective pants
May I suggest you take it down a notch or two?

We're not exactly sure why you're upset
Did that Seth Rogen movie make you super mad?
You'd like us if you got to know us, I bet
We're mostly harmless, peaceful people
Hey, we're really not so bad
My point is:

Please don't nuke us, North Korea
Right now, we're all a little tense
We don't hate you
Frankly, we don't think that much about you
No offense!

Now, you might call us blood-thirsty dogs
But that metaphor is not very apt
We're just a bunch of simple, fidget-spinning, goofy dorks
Who probably couldn't find your country on a map
No, we're not savages or cannibals
Well, maybe just a really, really, really, small percent
So I think it would be best
If you'd knock down those missile tests

Don’t turn us into cinder
While we’re swiping right on Tinder
Don't jump-start Armageddon
Or our beds we'll soon be wettin'
Would ya think this through for a moment, please?
Now why would ya bomb our nice celebrities
Why in the world would you kill Tom Hanks?
'Cause nobody doesn't like Tom Hanks!

So please don't nuke us, North Korea
That would seriously ruin our day
Remember
We're not evil, psychotic monsters
No matter what your news may say
We're just some goofballs from the USA
(please don't nuke us, please don't nuke us)
HEY!
Just out of the infantry this morning
I had to pay my dues across the sea
No one back in boot camp ever warned me
What the readjustment blues would do to me

"Welcome to Havana," said the pilot
"We must have made a wrong turn on the way"
"Let's buy some cigars and keep it quiet
If they don't know we're here, we'll get away"

Just as I had realized he was joking
I saw we were in Washington D.C
'Cause there was all the patriotic buildings
Just like I had seen them on T.V

It must have been a holiday 'cause there was this parade
People carried signs I couldn't read that they had made
'Till I got closer and my heart fell to my socks
There was a battle raging and the air was filled with tear gas and rocks

And there was the flag I'd fought against so often
The one I fought for hanging upside down
The wind was blowing hard, the dirt was flying
It made the city sky look dark and brown
I saw a girl, she could have been my sister
Except her hair was long and in her face
She explained this was a demonstration
Against the war and for the human race

Now I've seen a lot of strange things in my travels
Cannibals, yes, and aliens galore
But I never thought I'd see so many people
Saying we don't want your + + + war!

The troops all had on uniforms just like the one I'd worn
But they were all domestic and my duty tour was foreign
They carried guns just like the ones across the sea
Except this time I was the citizen and they was pointing their guns at me

Yes, I was just a citizen
And I was walking down the street
And it was just then that the readjustment blues
Got through to me
I'd know you anywhere, I'd know that grin
I'd know you anywhere when you walked in
I would tingle with a single glance in your eye
Watching the starlight dance in your eye
You saw my vacant stare, you understood
I'd love you anywhere, honest I would
I was certain this would happen, strange as it seems
I'd know you anywhere from my dreams

[Refrain]
Hana
Hana

[Verse 1]
Hana steps out of a storm
Into a stranger's warm but hard-up kitchen
She sees what must be done, so she takes off her coat
Rolls up her sleeves and starts pitching in

[Verse 2]
Hana has a special knack for getting people back on the right track
'Cause she knows they all matter
So she doesn't argue or flatter, she doesn't fight the slights
She takes it on the chin like a champ

[Refrain]
Hana
Hana

[Verse 3]
Hana says when life's a drag, don't cave in
Don't put up a white flag, raise up a white banner
In this manner, straighten your back
Dig in your heels and get a good grip on your grief

[Verse 4]
Hana says, "Don't get me wrong, this is no simple Sunday song
Where God or Jesus comes along and they save you
You've got to be braver than that
You tackle the beast alone with all its tenacious teeth

[Outro]
Light the lamp
Hana
Hana
Hana
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun
For another overload
I hear you singing in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows
That stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
Now, maybe the world doesn't see you
And maybe they don't understand
Just 'cause you don't see the footprints
Don't mean that they're not in the sand

I know you're surrounded by strangers
It feels so alone in your heart
But when everyone stands in the darkness
No one can tell them apart

Now everyone has their own stories
And nobody's end's quite the same
I love for the days in the sunshine
Up over the nights in the rain

But love brings change, oh, yes it does
(Love brings change, change)
Love brings change
(Love brings change, change)
Oh, love brings change when you need it
(Love, love, love brings change)
When you look eye to eye with an angel
Don't mean that it's always the end
Sometimes it's the start of a new blessing
That comes in the form of a friend

Now we all live in fear of when that day will come
When memories are all we can hold
The fire that burns is a natural love
And it keeps us both warm when it's cold

Now all I wanna do is see ya laugh again
And see that same joy in your eyes
I know that you're trying to just keep on smiling
And everything passes with time

'Cause love brings change
(Love brings change, change)
Oh, love brings change
(Love brings change, change)
It is a fact, ay, ay, ay
(Love, love )
Love brings change, love brings change

Be still, wait on it
On the blessings, girl
In the morning time, yeah
Be still, wait on it
Change is gonna come, oh oh

[Intro]
Hey, baby
What you doing?
Well, stay there
I got a surprise for you
I'm on my way over

[Verse 1]
Suddenly I feel like I wanna break loose
Jump in my six and come and see you
Girl, I'm gonna do something that's brand new
Um, I got a kinky surprise for you
So girl, get ready 'cause I'm on my way
Put your sexy body in some negligee
And if you feel me, let me know it right now
And baby, this is how it's all going down
There'll be

[Chorus]
Three knocks at the door, my baby
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby
Sit back in the chair, my baby
'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby
And get your body real open, baby
And do what you been hoping, baby
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo
Do you mind if I strip for you?

[Verse 2]
Now I'ma stop and get some gas, my baby
That gives you time to freshen up, my baby
And if you want, just leave the door unlocked
I'll be creeping in 'bout 12 o'clock
So turn the telephones off, my baby
No interruptions while I'm driving you crazy
Girl, I want you to know tonight is yours
Start in the bed and end up on the floor
There'll be

[Chorus]
Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby (sit back)
Sit back in the chair, my baby (ohh)
'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby (and get your body)
And get your body real open, baby (do what)
And do what you been hoping, baby (girl tonight)
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo (do you)
Do you mind if I strip for you?

[Bridge]
(You'll be watching) watching
(Slowly rolling) slowly rolling
(For you) for you
Whatever you want me to do, I will do
(Girl, I promise) baby, I promise
(You will not regret)
You won't regret it
I'm everything that you ever wanted
I'ma strip to the bone
And just let you get on it, girl

[Chorus]
Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby (just sit back)
Sit back in the chair, my baby (relax)
'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby (about to go there)
And get your body real open, baby (open)
And do what you been hoping, baby (tonight)
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo (oh oooh)
Do you mind if I strip for you? (you)
Three knocks at the door, my baby
(I bet three knocks, I bet three knocks)
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby (baby just sit back)
Sit back in the chair, my baby (I'm about)
'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby (get you open, girl)
And get your body real open, baby
(for what you been hoping, girl)
And do what you been hoping, baby (ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo (pull a switcheroo)
(Do you mind) do you mind if I strip for you?
(If I strip for you)
Three knocks at the door, my baby (ohh, oh, oohhh)
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby
(Said my clothes is coming off baby)
Sit back in the chair, my baby (so just sit back, baby)
'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby
(I'm about to go there, baby)
And get your body real open, baby (open, baby)
And do what you been hoping, baby (hoping, baby)
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo (pull a switcheroo, yeah)
Do you mind if I strip for you?
Three knocks at the door, my baby
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby
Sit back in the chair, my baby
'Cause I'm about to go there, my baby
Without a song, the day would never end
Without a song, the road would never have been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good, no how
Without a song, without a song

[Intro]
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?

[Verse 1]
I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside de house dey bring
And when I talk they start to sing:

[Chorus]
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey

[Verse 2]
I couldn't even digest me supper
Due to the children's behavior
John (Yes, pa), come here a moment
Bring de belt, you're much too impudent
John says it's James who started first
James tells the story in reverse
I drag my belt from off me waist
You should hear them screamin' 'round de place

[Chorus]
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey

[Interlude]
Hey! I kill mother's son!

[Verse 3]
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
They're making fun, my wife declare
You should be proud of them, my dear
These children were taught too bloomin' slack
That ain't no kind of joke to crack

[Chorus]
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mouth
That is your daddy, oh no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey

[Outro]
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
Shut your mouth, go away
Mama, look a boo-boo dey
St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Oh, she pulls her man around by her apron strings
Well, if that wasn't for powder or for her store-bought hair
You know that gal I love wouldn't have gone nowhere, nowhere

I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause that gal I love, she's gonna left this town

Well, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
Oh, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause that gal I love, she's gonna left this town
St. Louis woman

St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Oh, you know she pulls her man around by her apron strings
Well, if that wasn't for powder or for her store-bought hair
You know that gal I love wouldn't have gone nowhere, nowhere

Got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be
Oh, that gal's gotta heart like a rock cast in the sea
Well, oh hell, she wouldn't have gone so far from me
Today is the day to say I do
Yes, I promise to be true

I pledge all my love to you always
Don't you know this ring
This ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above oh, oh
Who cherish all the magic of our days

Oh Lord, oh Lord, here I stand
Golden chains around our hearts
Vow to death we'll never part
From this day as one we'll start our lives

Oh Lord, here I stand
With my heart out in my hand
Rich or poor, I am your man
I'm your lover and friend for life
Ooh

So much love, so much love, girl
So much love, girl, la, la, la, la
Today, today, today is the day to say I do
Yes, I promise to be true
I pledge all my love to you always
Don't you know this ring
This ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above oh, oh
Who cherish all the magic of our days

And I can hear them when they play
Our Brazilian wedding song
Frank Sinatra
Miscellaneous
I Cried For You (Now It's Your Turn To Cry Over Me)
I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has its turning, that's one thing I'm learning
I cried for you, what a fool I used to be
Now I find your eyes just a little bit bluer
And I find your heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you, not it's your turn to cry over me
Yeah. Yeah

Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night
I've been in fashion from the start
I've been unselfish with my heart
And if I've been around the world
Met a million different girls
You'd still be in with half a chance
If you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I'll do things for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
Yeah
Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night
I've been in fashion from the start
I've been unselfish with my heart
And if I've been around the world
Met a million different girls
You'd still be in with half a chance
If you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I'll do things for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties

Yeah
Hey, ya know, Rob
The word, Mike, what's up? Man
I got something to tell you
Oh, tell me my brother
While you were gone, your woman
My woman what?
Your woman steppin' out on you
I gotta talk with this girl, right now

Girl, rumor has it that you're leaving
Girl, tell me that it isn't so
Woh
Never been one to show my feelings
Kept my emotions deep inside, oh
You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
That's what it took to open up my eyes
Baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
Baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know, ever know
Spoken: Ever know baby
Girl, I never was a fancy, fancy talker
And girl, I write my passion in a song
Oh
Hope my melody is appealing
Words that I say can change your mind
Our love is poetry in motion
I need to have you here to make the lyrics rhyme
Oh baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
Baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know, ever know
I can't stand, I can't stand it
Ever know
Ever more
Ever know
Ever know
Check me out
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I want to go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
(Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
Let me go home

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide songs being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
They know, everybody knows that Santa's on his way
With lot of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is trying to spy
You know that, to see if reindeer really know how to fly
Everybody knows, reindeer fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to you
Merry Christmas to you
I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning
And thunder were desire
This old house would have burnt down
A long time ago

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl
I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time
And no matter how I try
The years just flow by
Like a broken down dam
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go

There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear 'em in there buzzin'
And I ain't done nothin'
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the mornin'
Come home in the evenin'
And have nothin' to say?

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go

Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go

Its a perfect day*
The coolest breeze
Not a cloud in the sky
Casts a shade on me
Colours shining bright
Oh, Its so surreal
And on this perfect day
I got lost
Get me out of this confusion
I'm falling apart
I've got an aching heart
I'm so out of place

[Chorus:]
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
On a perfect day
I'm drowning in memories
Throw me a lifeline, don't think its my time
And I can hardly breathe
Oh, why did you have to leave
On a perfect day

[Chorus:]
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
We all know that you're not a lonely heart
We can't stand the laws
You're watching over us, taking care of us
Until we meet again, my friend
You are everything to me and I love you for it
But now you're gone
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on, so carry on, I carry on
It'll be okay

[Intro]
(Care to dance, goes too far)
(I Believe My Time Ain't Long, take one)
(Shhh, tell her to shut up)
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna get up in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gonna get up in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best gal I'm lovin'
Now, my friends can get my room

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
And if I don't find her West Illinois
She'll be in East Monroe, I know

[Verse 3]
I don't want no woman
Want ev'ry downtown man she meet
No, I don't want no woman
Want ev'ry downtown man she meet
She's a no good li'l doney
She'd not allowed out on the street, mm-hmm, now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I believe
I believe my time ain't long
I believe
I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
And break up my happy home, mm-hmm
Hello, young lovers, whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own

I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own

[Intro]
Brothers? (Yeah)
Sisters? (Yeah)
Says here in Genesis, one chapter one
In the beginning God made the earth
It also says here in Genesis, six chapter six
That the children of Israel were sinning (Sinning)
A-sinning (Sinning), a-sinning (Sinning)
What did I say? (They were a-sinning)
That's exactly what I said
And when God saw them sinning
It hurt Him to his heart
It hurt Him so bad, it made Him mad
It made Him so mad, he was angry
And when God got angry, the sky turned dark
And it was than that he told Noah to build the ark
Who built the ark? (Noah)
Who built the ark? (Noah)
Who built the ark? (Noah, Noah)
Noah built that ark

[Verse]
Children, stop to still, listen to me
God walked down by the Briny sea
Beheld evil of the sinful man
Declared that he would destroy the land
Spoke to Noah, Brother Noah stopped
He said, "Looka here, Noah, build me an ark
Won't you build it big and strong
Build it three hundred cubic long
Thirty high, about fifty wide
I want it to stand my rain and tide
On this day I make my mark
In a hundred years I want that ark
Knock it free with this evil land
Not a living thing is gonna stand
Except the things that I tell to you
That I'm gonna need when the world is new
I've been east and I've been west
I've decided to put this world at rest
I've been up and I've been down
Nothing but evil all around
I've seen brother turn against brother
Up this high and it'll go no further
Women weep and children mourn
Sorry the day that man was born
Sinful people one by one
Sorry the day my wrath begun
Sorry the day my wrath begun
Sorry the day my wrath begun
Sorry the day my wrath begun
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
And all this land is my land
Not a living thing is gonna stand
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)

[Bridge]
Who built the ark? (Noah) Yeah
Who built the ark? (Noah) Yeah
Who built the ark? (Noah, Noah)
Noah built the ark

[Verse 2]
When after God told him what to do
Then the work began cut and hew
Ringing of the hammer was "judgment"
Ringing of the saw "God said repent"
Hundred years he hammered and sawed
Building the ark by the grace of God
After the foundation was laid
Hewed down the timber and the ark was made
Called in the animals two by two
There was the Ox, the Camel and the Kangaroo
Elephant, the monkey and the crocodile
He even made the animals they couldn't smile
Packed them in the ark so tight
The Owl couldn't get no sleep at night
Called in Japheth and Shem and Ham
God began to flood the land
Raised his hand to heaven on high
And He knocked that sun and the moon from the sky
Shook the mountains and disturbed the sea
Hitched his reins to his Chariot Wheel
Stepped on land and stood out on shore
Declared this time couldn't be no more

[Outro]
Declared this time couldn't be no more
Declared this time couldn't be no more
Declared this time couldn't be no more
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain ('Cause it's gonna rain)
'Cause it's gonna rain
Please don't let me argue anymore
I won't make you worry like before
Can't remember what we fought about
Late, late last night, we said it was over
But I remember when we thought it out
We both had a broken heart

(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you
(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you

As I drove away I felt a tear
It hit me, I was losing someone dear
Told my folks I would be alright
Tossed and I turned, my head was so heavy
Then I wondered as it got light
Were you still awake like me?

(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you
(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you tight
(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you
(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you
(Whoa baby) Kiss me, baby
(Whoa baby) Love to hold you

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Verse 1]
I'll write a song
I thought about it for far too long
But I've never had someone to sing about
Until I met her and each day gets better
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody else understands me like she
Now that I know what true love means
I Just hope she stays with me

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Verse 2]
She wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how love's supposed to be
She wants it better
I want to let her know
She belongs right here with me
She's heard it all but I'll make her see
I'll make her fall
Make her believe
I promised her that I'll never leave

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Bridge]
I just had to write a song about her
Tell her I don't wanna leave without her
Tell her I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll never leave her alone

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

Each day gets better
I just can't let her go

Each day kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Ah, I had a lot of love last night
Ah...
Ah, I had a lot of love last night
Ah...
Ah...

I've given all my love away and I've been left with none
But can you say that I'm to blame for loving anyone
I used to think that I was always older then my time
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time

Ah, I had a lot of love last night
(had a lot a lot of love)
Ah...
Ah, I had a lot of love last night
(had a lot a lot of love)
Ah...

I'm casting all my dreams hereto, my fish have gone to sea
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me
I always used to think that I was better then my kind
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time
Ah, I had a lot of love last night (had a lot a lot of love)
Ah, I had a lot of love last night

Somebody once told him that he wouldn't take Prince through the ringer
Let him go down as a washed up singer
Ain't that a bitch?

Bury him face down, let the motherfuckers kiss a ass, OK?

Face down! {x2}

Told 'em he wanted 2 sing a song about a black child goin' buck wild
And they just laughed in his face
Talk 2 your lawyer but U got no case
What U need 2 do is keep your place
Next time U pull a card, it better be a ace motherfucker
Or U can lay face down (Face down!)

But when them motherfuckers turn around ass up, U're what?

Face down! 1 2

Hmph, fuck all y'all
Face down! {x3}
We're together again (oh darlin')
We're together again (oh darlin')
Out of all the times you made me cry
Out of all the times you made me sigh
Still we're together again (we're together again)

I didn't want ever want you to go
Darlin' I can't help but let the whole world know
That we're together again (we're together again)

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

[Bridge 1]
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt
Oh

[Chorus]
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh-oh)

Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

[Bridge 2]

Now I know how Joan of Arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt
Eh

[Chorus]
Oh, Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Yesterday (yesterday)
All my troubles seem so far away
Now it seems as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

[Verse 1]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday

[Chorus]
Yesterday (yesterday)
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Why she had to go I don't know
She would not say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Chorus]
Yesterday (yesterday)
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
I believe in yesterday
Was so far away
Oh yesterday was far away
And I know I can't turn back
'Cause yesterday is...gone
Love, are you awake or are you sleeping?
I'm so excited I could die...
Starting out our lives
Must make some plans for the future
Now we need to settle down...
Make a home our own

What we gonna do when the baby comes?
It won't be long

Love, am I awake or am I dreaming?
I'm so excited I could cry
At times I'm so afraid
Say you'll get a job
And never leave us...
Though I know you'll make it right
Find a better life

What we gonna do when the baby comes?
It won't be long
Don't you ever go
Say you'll never leave
Promise you won't ever leave
Don't leave me
We need you

Rose
I will try to settle down but
I can't tell the future
Rose
I will try to stay around but
I don't know the future

Oh Rose
You'll never know
Just how much I need
You so

Oh Rose, you'll never see
Just how much you mean
To me

But Rose
This road is so hard and long
And I just can't say
Take me to your world of wonder
Let me come inside your room
Invisible
Now you see nothin'
Some investigation as to the state of us
No misunderstanding girl
On either side

I couldn't lie if I try any other way
I can't stop thinking of that girl of mine
I'm for the rise and the fall
Any other way and

Ohh
Ride on my ghost train
Ohh
You shouldn't do it, you shouldn't do it
Ohh
Ride on my ghost train
Ohh
Who can stop your past from rushing by
Born to live one million stories high
Into the night
Into the day
Take me to a town or country
Stranger in a strange land
And I'm an alien
No you can't find me
You be there at the station
When the train arrives
When it leaves I get my hands on you

I fool myself if I turn any other way
I still keep searchin' for that girl of mine
I'm for the hell of it all

Do it anyway and

Ohh
Ride on my ghost train
Ohh
Hearts can break and hearts can
Turn the tide
All is love and love is open wide
Ghost train
Ghost train
Into the night
Into the day

[Verse 1]
We had some chickens
No eggs would they lay
We had some chickens
No eggs would they lay
My wife said "Honey
This isn't funny, we're losing money
Why don't the little chickens lay?"

[Bridge]
One day a rooster came into our yard
And caught those little chickens
Right off their guard, ha ha ha ha

[Outro]
They're laying eggs now just like they used to
Ever since that rooster came into our yard
They're laying eggs now just like they used to
Ever since that rooster came into our yard

Just a few months ago, I had the pleasure of going to a place in New York City called the Blue Angel. And there, I had the privilege of seeing and hearing one of the newest, one of the most refreshing groups I've heard in a long, long time. These young fellas are very young, as you will see in a moment. And their main concern at the moment is not getting hit recordings or, uh, trying to get work. Their main concern at the moment is trying to stay out of the United States Army, ha ha ha ha ha—a problem which I have long since not had to care about. However, for their first appearance at Carnegie Hall, it gives me great pleasure and the great privilige to share a program with the magnificent Chad Mitchell Trio
"Ha Ha Ha", says Mama Bear as she irons Daddy's holey underwear
And "Hee Hee Hee", says Daddy bear as Junior pours honey all on sister's hair
Anyway you know they live happily ever after

Well, "Ho ho ho" say the little fish
As the sad fisherman goes home without a hitch
But "Hee hee hee" says the fisherman
With his lady burning french fries in the frying pan
(This is so silly man)

"Hee hee hee" says you to me
(Man I don't feel like going through with this, this is really silly)
Oh man, I wanna die
'Cause walking around on the ground is really cramping my high
I sure don't wanna live without you forever after, no

Now what does all this have to do with the three little bears?
Well, I was just feeling blue, 'cause I really care
That you're still gone from me and I'm as sad as I can be
So I'll sing and play this tune until you come back home to me
So long, my love, goodbye, farewell, adieu
So long, my love, our love's no longer true
Let's make the final scene nice and clean, no aftermath
Oh miss the bitter talk, and just walk us a separate path, face it
Be sure this kiss is now an endless thing
I seem to miss the bells that use to ring
So like they say in France, when romance is all fini
Please give me my chapeau, cause I gotta get going
I'll say so long , my love, before you say it to me

Let's face it, be sure this kiss is now an endless thing
I seem to miss the bells that use to ring
So like they say in France when romance is all fini
Please give me my chapeau, I gotta get rolling
So I'll say so long, my love, buzz off, my love
Take a walk, my love, before you say it, before you lay it on me
Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough baby
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Don't worry baby
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
'Cause baby
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe
Remember the day
I set you free
I told you, you could always count on me darling
From that day on, I made it a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, some how
'Cause baby
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe
Oh, no, darlin'
No wind, no rain
Or winters cold
Can't stop me baby
'Cause you are my goal
If your ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just sing for me, ooh, baby
My love is alive
Down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can
Don't ya know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
At the moment there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough

[Intro]
She likes, she likes, she likes
She likes, she likes, she likes
That's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
That's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (yeah, Jason Derulo)

[Verse 1]
Now get on over here and get up on this bed
I'm all up on you, now lock me in with your legs
Pulled your shirt to the left and kissed that one
Pulled your shirt to the right, how did I miss that one?
I really want it but I love it that you're teasing it
Once I start I ain't gon' stop until I'm pleasing it
Almost time to come up out them jeans
Huh, you know exactly what I mean uh

[Pre-Chorus]
As we take it from the bed to the floor
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa
If you're ready, say you're ready and you'll see
First one's coming by the time you count to three

[Chorus]
One, like a teacher, you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an all on ya
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
One, I can feel it coming down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Oh, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, referee, I think we're ready for round two
Stay right there, I'll come to you
Just relax while I analyze your tattoos
Tryna see where I'ma put my name on your back, boo
Just when you thought the waterpark couldn't get no wetter
I'm dripping down a back, like I'm doing it in my sweater
Rise above the oven, cream on the cupcake
Hazelnut flavored, Haagen Dazs milkshake

[Pre-Chorus]
As we take it from the bed to the floor
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa
If you're ready, say you're ready and you'll see
First one's coming by the time you count to three

[Chorus]
One, like a teacher, you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an all on ya
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
One, I can feel it coming down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (four, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Nobody-body is listening, let it go
'Cause I wanna hear you sing, baby, sing
Somebody-body better turn on the radio
'Cause I wanna hear you sing, baby, sing
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Oh, baby, yeah, woah-oh, woah-oh

[Chorus]
One, like a teacher, you're sending me to the corner (woo)
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an all on ya
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
One, I can feel it coming down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (oh, baby)
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (oh, baby, that's when you're singing like)
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah (that's when you're singing like)
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Huh, that's my shit
We're the orchestra to your board
And we beg for the scraps from your table
All we want is to be like you
Music to play your ___
Pump pumping sounds through the speakers below
Hello
I've tried so hard to keep still
They will chew you up
They will spit out your bones
Standing in the shadows at the end of the bed
I never said anything
I live a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a band
It seems so volatile
Oh my, oh my
He was a good man
And he said he was the best
They said that even when life spat in his face
He put everything back in its right place
A conflict of interest, you might say
Are you trying to bribe me?
_____ for my sins
We are plants, happy plants
Superhuman builders' day
See
____________
I leave you for bitch of _____ and go green
Loved to death like egg mayonnaise
With a grin like roadkill
Fine, let's stay
Everything is alive
There is nothing but blue skies from now on
No ghosts, no skeletons
A man hovers in the dust, dust, dust
Thank you very much, thank you
Everybody drive home safe and carefully tonight
And we'll see you in our lounge in a few weeks time
Goodnight! God bless!
Let's go home, Jonny

[Intro]
Kells
Yo, I can't keep doin' this
I got to say something
You feel me?
See, I just can't keep living life confused, girl
We gotta make a move
Tell me something, 'cause uh

[Verse 1]
First, you wanna go, then you wanna stay
And then you wanna talk about it, baby (What?)
Put your bag down, and pick your bag up
And then you just walk out on me, baby (What?)
If love were ice, then I can see a future
In what we're doing, baby (What?)
Girl, I'm not tryin' to confuse ya
Just wanna spend my life wit' you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
(Girl, please tell me where do we go from here?)
Girl, I wanna change your name to my name
And I know you feel the same way, so
Girl, let's just go get far away from here
And let it beat, let our hearts beat
Take a deep breath — now, baby, hold on

[Chorus]
(Hold on) And girl, don't let go
(Hold on) Yeah, just keep holding on
(Hold on) Baby, we'll walk through the storm together
(Hold on) Oh yeah, girl, I promise you this love's forever

[Verse 2]
First, you say you love me
And then you say, well, I don't know (What?)
We both feel same, so baby, what the hell
Let's go (What?)
You holla at your friends, I'll handle the streets
Let's just let 'em all know (What?)
Girl, I gotta be with you if I'm gonna be free
'Cause you are my soul, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
(Girl, please tell me where do we go from here)
Tell me, girl, I wanna change your name to my name
And I know you feel the same way, too
Girl, let's just go far away from here (Far away from here)
And let it beat, let our hearts beat
Take a deep breath — now, baby, hold on

[Chorus]
(Hold on) And girl, don't let go
(Hold on) You just keep holding on
(Hold on) Oh yeah, girl, we'll walk through the storm together
(Hold on) Hey, and I promise this love is forever

[Bridge]
(Although, we've come from two different worlds)
Oh, baby, that doesn't matter to me
'Cause my world is you, yeah
(Who would've thought we would get this far?)
And I don't care what the world may say
It's you and me against all odds

[Chorus]
(Hold on) Hold on, and baby, be strong
(Hold on) We can make it, baby, if we just hold on
(Hold on) We'll walk through the storm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hold on) Just hold on, just hold on
(Hold on) Hold on, just hold on

[Outro]
(Hold on) (We're gonna make it, baby)
(Hold on) (We're gonna make it, baby) (What?)
(Hold on) (We're gonna make it, baby)
(Hold on) (We're gonna make it, baby) (What?)
(Hold on) (We're gonna make it, baby)
(Hold on) (We're gonna make it, baby) (What?)
Know when it's right
U know when U feel it, baby
U hold it, U hear it, U touch it, it's right
Everybody know who's U, who's U
When it's real soul
Ain't no way 2 fight it

Sing it girls
(Uh-huh!) {repeat in song}
Ah yeah
Yeah, yeah

When I was a little itty bitty baby
Yo, cookin' in the belly, wasn't even born
The way my mama tell it, drove that woman crazy
Every time I hear the music, I start kickin' on the 2 and 4, oh!

Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - cuz it's the one it's got 2 be
Remember now, when I was just a little boy of 7
Preacher man, Sunday mornin' talk about heaven and hell
"Hey brother, if U don't believe and change your evil ways
The rain gonna come, there won't be nowhere 2 run
Nobody 2 tell ya?

Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! ?it's the one it got 2 be, alright

Hey now pretty sweet thing, tell me where U got that walk
I feel it when U hold my hand, U got these old knees just-a-knockin'
When, when U give me that kiss, fill me through and through, huh
I don't know where U got it, girl, but don't U dare stop doin' what U do

Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - yeah, U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - cuz it's the one it's got 2 be

If I already ain't change your mind, tell U one more story
Only a man that's truly blind can't see the glory
Think about what U're doin' here, think about what U say
If U shine the light on your brother when he's lost his way
Then guess what?
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
This irrepressible lover boy can not misjudge one another
Let me suppose U got the right one, baby

One more, one more

CHORUS {Parts repeat in BG}
Writer(s): Dennis/Adair

I make a date for golf -
You can bet you life it rains
I try to give a party -
And the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go thru life;
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Ev'rything happens to me

I never miss a thing -
I've had measles and the mumps
And ev'ry time I play my ace -
My partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool;
Who never looks before he jumps
Ev'rything happens to me

At first my heart tho't;
You could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick;
To end my despair
But now, I just can't fool;
This head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and called;
I sent "Air Mail Special", too;
You answer was goodbye -
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once;
And then it had to be with you
Ev'rything happens to me

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

Everybody keeps on talking about it... nobody's getting it done
I'm tired, tired, tired now of listening, listening... knowing that the ship's gotta run

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Everybody keeps on pushing and shoving... nobody's, got the guts] (x3)
You owe me ti-ti-time, now they're writing me in... I'm gonna act like I should

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Everybody keeps on listening in... Nobody listening up] (x2)
We've been try-try-trying now to let you in... And, you just got let in by their luck (?)
Everybody keeps on talking about it... nobody's getting it done

Everybody keeps on talking about it... nobody's getting it done
I'm tired, tired, tired now of listening, listening... knowing that the ship's gotta run, just gotta run
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x2)

This is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between
What we have now
And what we wish we could have

More fulfilling--and less frustrating

Out of the envy in our eyes
Glamorous picture people rise
Gleaming down from screens and pages
Glamour before your very eyes

Isn't it true, isn't it true?
Good question, I know - who cares?
Look here they tell you
If you had this, if you had that
Latest styles and colors
If we had that for us, wouldn't it be fabulous?

If you had that house, car, bottle, jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars, movie stars, movie stars
Order your youth secrets of the stars
Call now, just $9.99
Our discontent is their delight
They offer relief for the purchase price
Love in a bottle, love on four wheels
Is that our new car Charles?

Isn't it true--isn't it true?
We guarantee it--pick up your phone and dial
See here they sell you
If you had this, if you had that
I want a new truck!--More power!
If you use this shampoo
True love will come to you

If you had that house, car, bottle, jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars, movie stars, movie stars
Hollywood's greatest legends

Recognize this?
Dreamer
Soft sexy hair
Dream on
He's going to love me in this ruby, ruby lipstick
Others will notice! Sexy! Who cares!

Recognize this?
Dreamer
Latest styles and colors
Oh, dream on, dream on, dream on
The fashion looks you've been hoping for
Sexy, ssexy
Recognize this?
Dreamer
So special
Dream on
We will have happiness in heaven
The place you dreamed of retiring to
Who cares

Recognize this?
Dreamer
I know that glamour is sexy
Oh dream on dreamer
What could go wrong?
Dream on
Who cares

Recognize this?
Dreamer
I'm afraid I can't go below two million
Dream on
Life would be easy if I had that new appliance
Food processors for all of us
Who cares

Recognize this?
Dreamer
There are lots of strings
Dream on
We can solve everything in science
Naturally
Science
It's a picture of how to get what you want out of life
Recognize this?
I love it
Dreamer
Isn't there some other way?
Who cares!

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
So you feel like you ain't nobody?
Always needed to be somebody?
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking

All you gotta do is save the world, yeah

[Verse 2]
So you feel it's the end of the story?
Find it all pretty satisfactory?
Well I tell you, my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making

Yes, you're a hero, ooh yeah

[Orchestral Part]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Flash!
A-ah!

[Reprise]
He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand (he'll save with a mighty hand)
He'll save with a mighty hand (he'll save with a mighty hand)
He saved with a mighty hand (save us)
Every man every woman every child (man, woman, child)
He's the mighty (mighty)

[Outro]
Flash!
A-ah!
When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

I'm afraid of the ghost
When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared on bandits

When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

And why am I irrational?
There are things I cannot control
When I'm alone at night
In the forest at night
I'm not scared of bandits
I cannot suppress it

I'm not oppressive
I'm afraid the ghost
(I'm afraid of the war)
I'm afraid of the war
(I'm afraid of the ghost)
I'm afraid the ghost
I'm afraid of them both

[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
My friends say you're so into me (Into me)
And that you need me desperately
They say you say we're so complete
But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long, it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Your body language says so much (So much)
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But 'til you say the words, it's not enough
Come on and tell me you're in love, please

[Chorus]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know

[Bridge]
Come on, baby, come on darling, ooh yeah
Come on, let me be the one
(I need to hear you say) I need to hear you say
(You love me all the way) You love me all the way
And I don't wanna wait another day

[Chorus]
Don't (don't), don't let me be the last to know
(Just let me be the one)
Don't (don't) hold back, just let it go (Just let it go)
(I need to hear you say) I need to hear you say
(You need me all the way) You need me all the way
So baby, if you love me
Don't (don't), don't let me be the last to know
Don't (don't) hold back, just let it go
(I need to hear you say) I need to hear you say
(You need me all the way) You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so
Don't let me be the last to know
There's a shining light
On my waking hours
It's not the day, it's the night
Not the morning shower

Fear will be around
If you don't wake up to a cup
Of Moreno's blend
It can all be the end
Now

Oh, I know
It's getting harder each day
Just trying to rise
I know there must be a way
To ease my troubled mind

Fear will be around
If you don't wake up to a cup
Of Moreno's blend
It can all be the end
Now
They called it stormy Monday,but Tuesday is as just as bad
Oh, they called it, they called it stormy Monday, but Tuesday, Tuesday is as just as bad
Oh, Wednesday is worst And Thursday oh so sad

The eagle flies on Friday now, Saturday I'll go out to play
Oh, the eagle, the eagle flies on Friday Saturday I'll go out and play
Sunday I'll go to church, and I fall on my knees and pray

I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
But Lord, Lord have mercy Lord have mercy on me
You know I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Lord, please send my baby back on to me

Help me out here man, help me out

Sun rise in the east, it set up in the west
Yes, the sun rise in the east baby, and it set up in the west

It's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
Which one, which one, which one a little bad
Yeah! Go ahead Do it one more time
Oh, the eagle flies on Friday Saturday I'll go out to play
Oh, the eagle flies on Friday You know Saturday I'll go out to play
Sunday I'll go out to the signify church Oh when I'll fall down on my knees and pray

I say, Lord have mercy Lord have mercy on me
Lord, Lord, Lord have mercy on me
Please, have mercy on me
You know I'm crazy, crazy 'bout my baby
Please, send her back, send her back on to me

Yeah!
How to make amends for the things they say
The girls avoid the stormy sky
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But I and my heathen heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
"Listen to the words!" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true

When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
(when the boys come marching home)
(home, marching home)

Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But, in truth, i don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learned to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster
Walking through the wars
The girls who never close 'til dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two
When the boys come marching home
(home, marching home)
(home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
(when the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home
(home, marching home)
(home, when the boys come marching home)
(home, marching home)

When my heart starts to beat like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
Oh when my heart starts to beat like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
You know you've only been gone 24 hours baby
And baby it seems like a million years

Now if I ever mistreated you baby
You know I didn't mean no harm
Oh if I ever mistreated you baby
God knows I didn't mean no harm
You know I'm just a little country boy baby
And I was raised right down on the cotton farm

Oh you give me so much trouble baby
Baby I don't know what to do
Oh you give me so much trouble baby
Baby I don't know I don't know what to do
I ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing now baby
Baby it's all over and it's all on account of you
Who's that lady
Beautiful lady
Who's that lady
The real, real, real fine lady
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I didn't get a chance
To ask her to dance
It was love at first sight
I just saw her tonight
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I like the way she danced in the dark
And disappeared in the night
And oh she stole my heart
It was love at first sight

Who's that lady
Beautiful lady
Who's that lady
I gotta meet that lady
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me
Who's that lady
That real fine lady
Who's that lady
That beautiful lady
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

Say hey lady
I'm in love with you

[Intro]
Ooh
Ah, ah, a-ah

[Verse 1]
Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Verse 2]
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Bridge]
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

[Chorus]
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted (Haunted), haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, ooh

[Intro]
This is how we funk on the Northside

[Chorus]
This is how we funk on the Northside
Players ain't gon' stop till it's sold
This is how we funk on the Northside
To get paid in the Moneyapple, got to be bold

When you cop your paper next Friday
This is what I want you all to do
Nevermind the vapor come up my way
We got something freaky for you

Never you mind what you find in the state of your mind
Your city or part of town
When you get up in the Moneyapple
Baby you got to get down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Hey hey hey hey!

[Chorus]
This is how we funk on the Northside
Players ain't gon' stop till it's sold
This is how we funk on the Northside
To get paid in the Moneyapple, got to be bold
(Oh)
(This is how we funk)

When you get tired of the Muzak
That's playin' on that no-funk radio (Uh)
We gotta taste the bass that'll take your face to the Ace of Spades
You never ever thought your ugly face would go
Bass: tell ya one time

Never you cry when you buy a sample single
From the NPG got joints for days
Chart be gone we get it on stage, baby
Aftershow's on the Internet, players gettin' paid!

Hey, this is how we funk
Oh yeah
Hey, this is how we funk
(Hey) Everybody say


(Oh, oh)
(How we funk)
(How) {x3}
With a bone 2 play
We can find the mayor
Talk about that piece of land
Fill a garden y'all
Fill a fan with some hand picked images like the man
Sweet potatoes like U never seen (Tell it)
Martin wasn't the only one that had a dream
Know what I mean? (Woo!)

[Chorus]
This is how we funk on the Northside
Players ain't gon' stop till it's sold
This is how we funk on the Northside
To get paid in the Moneyapple, got to be bold

This is how we funk on the Northside
Players ain't gon' stop till it's sold
This is how we funk on the Northside
To get paid in the Moneyapple, got to be bold

This is how we funk on the Northside
Players ain't gon' stop till it's sold
This is how we funk on the Northside
To get paid in the Moneyapple, got to be bold
(This is how we, this is how we funk)
(We, we be...)
(NPG, so funky it's good to me)
(Northside) (Hey)
This is how we funk on the Northside
This is how we funk on the Northside
Got to be bold
(Got to be)
This is how we funk on the Northside
This is how we funk on the Northside
This is how we funk on the Northside
This is how we funk on the Northside
This is how we funk on the Northside

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
I was once out strolling one hot and summer day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and I
Felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
But there I was (Oh, there I was)
I was taken to the place (Taken to the place)
The hall of the mountain king (Hall of the mountain king)
I stood high upon the mountaintop
Naked to the world
In front of me (In front of me)
Ah yeah, was every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones
Short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones
Big crazy ones
Out of the middle
Came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Ooh, ooh, something crazy

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
I thought to myself: What could this mean?
Am I going crazy or is it just a dream?
Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard
Somebody say

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Oh, spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl

[Verse 3: Ronald Isley]
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
And in the other, a glass, good God
She poured some of that wine
From the bottle into the glass
And she raised it to her lip
And just before she drank it, she said
Spill that wine

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine, yeah, yeah)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Spill, spill, spill, spill, spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl
Come on and spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl
Spill that wine

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Come on and take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Oh, take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill, spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl, good God
Come on and take that pearl
Come on and spill that wine

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Ah, take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl (Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Come on and spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl
Come on, spill that wine

[Chorus: The Isley Brothers, Ronald Isley]
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Oh, take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Come on and spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Yeah, yeah, spill that wine)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Come on and take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Won't you just spill it)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Come on and spill it)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Come on, spill that wine, yeah now)
Spill the wine; take that pearl
(Oh, oh, take that pearl)
Spill the wine; take that pearl

Spill the wine

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
Come on now, come on, take that pearl now
Spill that, spill that wine
I need you
Oh oh, I need you
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know
That I need you (so), (so), (so), (so)

I want you
Oh oh, I want you
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know
That I want you (so), (so), (so), (so)

[Paul]
You knew my lips were lonely for, the kisses you could give to me
Ever since the first day, baby, that we met

[Eddie]
So if you say you're mine and let our hearts combine
I swear I'll never let you forget how much...

I love you
Oh oh, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know
That I love you (so), (so), (so), (so)
I need you
Oh oh, I want you

[Paul:] Baby, baby, baby

[Eddie:] Baby
Oh oh, I love you

[Paul:] Darling, darling

[Eddie:] Oh, darling
Oh oh, oh
Come home, come home, come home, come home

[Paul:] Can't you see that I need it

[Eddie:] Bring it home to me, baby
Come home, come home, come home, come home

[Paul:] I really really love you, baby

[Eddie:] Hey, baby
Come home, come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home, come home

[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Bridge]
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

[Chorus]
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Outro]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I offer you the moon set in a summer sky
That is mine to give, se¤orita
I offer you the breeze singing a lullaby
That is mine to give, se¤orita
I can't bring a golden crown set with pearls and rubies rare
But I can bring a rose and place it in your hair
I offer you these things that come from up above
I give them and my love to you

I can't bring a golden crown set with pearls and rubies rare
But I can bring a rose and place it in your hair
I offer you these things that come from up above
I give them and my love to you
If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away;
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high;
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, or will be again;
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go, I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away
Please don't go away
I love him, I'm his
And everything he is, I am, too

I love her, we're one
There's nothing to be done

I have a love
And it's all that I need
Not a thing I can do (Not a thing I can do)

When love comes so strong
There is no right or wrong
Your love is so strong (When love comes so strong
There is no right or wrong.)
Your love is so strong. (I love him, I'm his.)
Be with her now forever. (And everything he is.)
And love her. (Your love?)
My love? (My life?)

I have a love
And there's nothing to be done
Right or wrong
(I love him, with a love) I have a love
And there's nothing to be done
Right or wrong

(I love him, with a love) I have a love
And there's nothing to be done
Right or wrong
Writer(s): Henry Mancini - Jay Livingston - Ray Evans

Dear heart, wish you were here to warm this night
My dear heart, it seems like a year since you've been out of my sight
A single room, a table for one
It's a lonesome town all right
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart, I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more

(A single room, a table for one)

Over and over

Hey, hey, don't say goodnight
When you know it's time for love
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say goodnight
Oh, when you know I gotta have your love

Help undress you girl

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't say goodnight
Oh, when you know I gotta have your love

Ooh we babe, don't ever, ever say
Don't ever, ever say
Ever, ever, ever say
Don't say goodnight, don't say goodnight
How would you like Aladdin's Lamp to call your own?
The wells that once was Singapore, fast Italian cars
Diamonds big as stars, just name it and it's yours
How would you like the finest laces from Cologne
And pearls that come from coral shores
And to match your eyes, blue Venetian skies
Just name it and it's yours
I know all this may sound extreme, and quite impossible to do
But when we kiss, the wildest dreams could very possibly come true
Until you have Aladdin's Lamp to call your own
Let's window shop the local stores
And for just a start, if you want a heart
I have one that worships and adores
Just name it, and it's yours
(musical interlude)
Until we have a dozen oil wells in the yard
Let's window shop the local stores
And for just a start, if you want a heart
I have one that worships and adores
Just name it, and it's yours

The sun sinks behind me in the west
This is the time of day I love best
Salt breezes murmur through the coconut palm
As the colors change, they set a scene of tropic calm

Seagulls headed back to land
Over the mangrove and the salt pan
By a lazy creek with a six pack and a fishin' line
Win back some memories and losin' track of time

I head a little further north each year
Leave the cities behind, out of sight out of mind
Up where my troubles can all disappear
I head a little further north each year

Feeling the night wrap around me
Eases my mind's serenity
Ocean waves are hummin' on the outer reef
These balmy days and sultry nights are a welcome relief

I head a little further north each year
Leave the cities behind, out of sight out of mind
Up where my troubles can all disappear
I head a little further north each year
I head a little further north each year
Taking my mind to an easier time
Up where there's silence and the night sky is clear
I head a little further north each year
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the base and the sunset glow
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like
(Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races?
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out
(Will we loved your last hit?)
So I'm thinkin', I'ma scoot me somethin' hot
In this south-sea meringue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Caribbean seas, with the hot mommies
Screamin'
(Aii poppy)
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your door, we flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta feed the film
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Don't get me wrong, Shytown got it goin' on
An New York is the city that we know don't sleep
An we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mierda, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami

Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

Welcome to Miami

[Verse 1]
Dark clouds before my eyes
Can't face the morning skies
Day comes a day too soon
I'm waiting for that silver moon

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm wrong
But I'm feeling like another night
Would make it alright

[Verse 2]
Twilight is fading through
Seems like I'm fading too
How can I believe it's real
When nothing starts to stop this wheel?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm wrong
But I'm feeling like another night
Would make it alright

[Verse 1]
Dark clouds before my eyes
Can't face the morning skies
Day comes a day too soon
I'm waiting for that silver moon

You want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You should see my body

I'm kinda tight, I'm feelin' right, enough to see somebody
I wanna let it off tonight
Wanna dance, wanna party
Wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Won't you sing my body
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance
Wanna be myself tonight, me bodied

[Verse 3]
Baby, all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh

While we grind to the beat
And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be
Ain't no worry, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop, just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body
Get somebody
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, let me work on you

[Chorus]
I ain't worried, doin' me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied, gettin' bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (Hey)

A country girl in Paris, moonlight on the Seine
Memories of Tennessee, Nashville in the rain
It's such a contradiction, a heart that's filled with pain
A country girl in Paris, dreamin' Nashville in the rain

She walks along the boulevard, Champs Alysee
Thinks about a country boy three thousand miles away
Pride is such a hard thing, it's such a price to pay
To be all alone in Paris with true love so far away

Up upon Mont Martre when she stops to rest awhile
All the artists look at her and they long to paint her smile
For even in her sorrow there's something in her eyes
That makes the young men jealous, makes the old men sigh

They say the loss of innocence is always linked to pain
For once the heart is opened nothing ever is the same
And so the evening lends itself to lovers and romance
The way to heal a broken heart is to give true love
One more chance
A country girl in Paris, moonlight on the Seine
Memories of Tennessee, Nashville in the rain
It's such a contradiction, a heart that's filled with pain
A country girl in Paris, dreamin' Nashville in the rain
A country girl in Paris, longing for Nashville in the rain
Turn it up

You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down

You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town

From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty, new sound
Come on now

You need to, you need to lay it down
Come on now
You need to, you need to lay it down
I see ya
You need to shut it up
Your cup ain't full enough
Let me show you what I learned
From laying in the cut

You need a six string
And let that sucker ring
The holy funking roll
Let it get the people up

You need to lay it down
(Get up)
You need to
(Get up)
You need to lay it down
(Get up, lay down)

To say this name borders on blasphemy
Everybody wanna be me
If your girlfriend didn't have the surgery
Maybe she could see what I see

You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down

You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town
From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Come on, now

Yours ain't really the grove we dance to
We need something more funky to move to
Y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
That purple bounce, bounce

Rio de Janeiro
Euro and Sud Amero
This dirty little groove for you
Let's do it now, come on, boo

Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now
Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now

Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now
Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now

You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town
From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Let's go

[Intro]
This isn't love
This isn't love, oh
Ayy, I love hard love
Why you wanna put a gun on my heart?
I just gotta say, ayy, oh
I just gotta say, ayy, oh

[Verse 1]
I've always loved hard, so I took it slow
I guess it's my fault 'cause I'm on the go
But I always cared for you
Not saying I'm perfect, not even close
But I don't deserve this but, girl, I suppose
I wasn't there for you enough 'cause

[Pre Chorus]
You're coming home late, with nothing to say
Can't look me in my face, I can't live on this way
Can't live on this way
Can't live on this way, hey, hey, hey
You put a thorn in my heart (heart)
That's when it starts (starts)
Just a little tear (tear), just a little tear (tear)
That's when I bleed (oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
When I bleed (bleed), I bleed out (out)
When I cry (cry), I cry loud (loud)
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
But when you leave, I bleed out
When I bleed (bleed), I bleed out (out)
When I cry (cry), I cry loud (loud)
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
But when you leave, I bleed out

[Verse 2]
I look in those eyes, there's nothing there
I'm looking into, the coldest stare
I've ever seen
We haven't touched each other forever
Don't know what I'd do, if we're not together
I'm not ready to leave, no, baby, baby, no, oh

[Pre Chorus]
You're coming home late, with nothing to say
Can't look me in my face, I can't live on this way
Can't live on this way (this way)
Can't live on this way, hey, hey, hey
You put a thorn in my heart (heart)
That's when it starts (starts)
Just a little tear (tear), just a little tear (tear)
That's when I bleed (oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
When I bleed (bleed), I bleed out (out)
When I cry (cry), I cry loud (loud)
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
But when you leave, I bleed out
When I bleed (bleed), I bleed out (out)
When I cry (cry), I cry loud (loud)
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
But when you leave, I bleed out

[Bridge]
Ayy, I love hard love
Why you wanna put a gun on my heart?
I just gotta say, ayy, oh
I just gotta say, ayy, oh
Ayy, I love hard love (love hard)
Why you wanna put a gun on my heart?
I just gotta say, ayy, oh
I just gotta say, ayy, oh (woo)

[Chorus]
When I bleed (bleed), I bleed out (out)
When I cry (cry), I cry loud (loud)
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
But when you leave, I bleed out
When I bleed (bleed), I bleed out (out)
When I cry (cry), I cry loud (loud)
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
But when you leave, I bleed out
When I bleed, I bleed out
When I cry, I cry load
When I love, you can bet I'm all in
When you leave, I bleed out

[Intro]
Gentlemen, hello

[Verse 1]
I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you, baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore

[Verse 2]
Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of

[Verse 1: Brad Delson]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings, no more

[Verse 2: Brad Delson]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again, no more

[Bridge: Brad Delson]
The wings have torn the flesh away
The early morning sings, no more

[Verse 2: Brad Delson]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again, no more

[Bridge: Brad Delson]
The wings have torn the flesh away
The early morning sings, no more

[Outro: Brad Delson]
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings, no more
I have but one heart, this heart I bring you
I have but one heart to share with you
I have but one dream that I can cling to
You are the one dream I pray comes true
My darling, until I saw you, I never felt this way
And nobody else before you, ever has heard me say
You are my one love, my life I live for you
I have but one heart to give to you

*Dicimo o mari, facimu l'amore
*A curi a curi che ci passa
*Ca u mare parla e na' carezza
*Ma a tia la brezza, fina murir
You are my one love, my love I live for you
I have but one heart to give to you
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home and I believe I'm gonna rain
We're so sorry but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring
We're so sorry Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil, and we're so easily called away
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Admiral Halsey notified me
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea
I had another look and I had a cup of tea and butter pie (Butter pie)
(The butter wouldn't melt so I put it in the pie)
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground Live a little, get around
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky
Hands across the water (Water)
Heads across the sky

[Verse 1]
How tides control the sea
And what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change
No two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan

[Pre-Chorus]
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

[Chorus]
(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) All my wrong from right
(Day) Or my day from night
(Dark) Or the dark from light
(I live) But I love this life

[Verse 2]
How infinite is space
And who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat
Where truth and fiction meet
Why nothing ever turns out as you plan

[Pre-Chorus]
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

[Chorus]
(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) All my wrong from right
(Day) Or the day from night
(Dark) Or the dark from light
(I live) But I love this life
Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight
Wear your boxing gloves in case some fool might wanna fight

Put on your high heeled sneakers and put your wig hat on your head
May not win a prize, I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock them dead
Well, these are just a bunch of guys from Detroit
Name of Bohannon
They can play the music straight
But they thought they'd double clutch it for you

So, you see, they got together
These cats sure are funky
And they thought you might dig a little dance
Called the Double Clutch

You see, these is just a bunch of cats from Detroit
Called Bohannon and them cats
So they got together and thought of this funky thing
They wanted y'all to do the Double Clutch

Sure is funky

You see, these cats from Detroit
Bohannon and Ray and Melvin
Playing the Double Clutch
Now, all through this album
We played the double up
Well, by now you should be deep in it

It's all over about now, y'all
We hate to leave you
But we got to go
This isn't sometime, this is always
This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

This isn't just midsummer madness
A passing glow, a moment's gladness
Yes, it's love, I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always
We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her

Look out babe

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day

Split man

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
Yo

Oh, yes it will

Oh, yes it will
This has been The Fugees
L Boogie, Prize Well, Wyclef
The Refugees are out
(Yes it will, yes it will, yes it will)
Perdido
I look for my heart
It's perdido
I lost it way down in torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero
I sway that they play the bolero
I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that's when my heart departed

High, was the sun when I held her close

Low, was the moon when we said, "adios"

Perdido
My heart ever since is perdido
I know I must go to torito
To find what I lost perdido

(scat)
High, was the sun when I held her close
Low, was the moon when we said, "adios"

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
Darlin', I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll gurantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Can we go back to the days when our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
They way they use to be
Oh God, give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes to face reality
Every moment without you, it seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Can we go back to the days when our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
They way they use to be
Oh God, give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Interlude: Michael McCary]
Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
(The blame is on me)
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe (Got to believe) in the spirit of love
(Spirit of love)
It can heal all things, we won't hurt anymore
No, I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
(Can we go back, babY? I just wanna go back, baby, yeah)
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
They way they used to be
Oh God give me a reason
(I'm down on bended, down on bended knee)
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
(Oh, ho, ho, baby)
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
(Wanna build a new life, just you and me
Wanna make you my wife, raise a family)
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
They way they used to be
Oh God, give me a reason
(Give me a reason)
I'm down on bended knee

[Outro: Shawn Stockman]
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee
The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're a lot older
And all because of the gal that got away

No more her eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you dreamed
Have all gone astray

The gal that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen its final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more, that all time thrill
For you've been though the mill
And never a new love
Will be the same
Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of hers, you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where she gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and it's tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow she may turn up
There just no let up
The live long night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A lost lost loser
Looking for the gal who got away

Please come back
Won't you come back
The gal that got away
Night grows cold
I've been lonely so much
Out of reach
Save it only for me
Nothing in life is the same
And the sooner we stop to start

And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn

Maybe you can hide your face forever
God knows it's true
That when you search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
To be heard

Souls on fire
Feel her voice in your ear
She goes on
Living only for me
Nothing you say could be wrong
'Cause you give me the lovers sign
And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn

Maybe we can share it all forever
But not 'til we do
I'm gonna search for someone
There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
To be heard

And baby are we waking up together
'Cause God knows it's you
If there is love for someone

And there's a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
There's a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn

Maybe we can share it all forever
But not 'til we do
I'm gonna search for someone

There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
To be heard

There's a heart like mine
There's a heart like mine
I just wanna see
The best side of me
And it's so easy to be
'Cause it's all
'Cause it's all in my lover's eyes

I just wanna know
The best way to go
And it's goin' to show
'Cause it's all
'Cause it's all in my lover's eyes

Love shinin' bright
By day and by night
Ooh...by candlelight
Well, it's all
Well, it's all in my lover's eyes

(Lover's eyes)

And love's gonna flow
Come and go
Oh...you know I know
That it's all
That it's all in my lover's eyes
I just wanna, I wanna, I wanna see
I wanna see the best side of me
And it's so easy to be
I know it's all
All in my lover's eyes

Oh, it's all in my lover's eyes
I know it is
Ooh...ah, yeah, baby
I wanna say it in a whisper

(Lover's eyes)

Ooh...ooh...
I love you, love you, baby
And I'll always, always, always, always need you, girl
Let us be wise and resigned
Let us be sweet and obedient
Let us be fit and guided
Let us be wise, let us submit

How sweet it is to obey and to carry out happiness
Whilst being appropriately unburdened by wise and worthy guides
Relieved from the heavy burden of responsibility
Responsibility for our direction of our behaviour

How sweet it is to obey and to carry out happiness
Whilst being appropriately unburdened by wise and worthy guides
Relieved from the heavy burden of responsibility
Responsibility for our direction of our behaviour
Which won't be necessary before the social laws of nature
Which won't be necessary before the social laws of nature
None but the lonely heart
Can know my sadness
Alone and parted
Far from joy and gladness

Heaven's boundless arch I see
Spread out above me
Oh, what a distance dear to one
Who loves me

None but the lonely heart
Can know my sadness
Alone and parted
Far from joy and gladness

Alone and parted far
From joy and gladness
My senses fail
A burning fire devours me
None but the lonely heart
Can know my sadness
All that I need is just a piece of paper
Say a few lines, make up my mind
So she can read it later, when I'm gone
Elisa, goodbye , Elisa

All that I need is just a quiet corner
Bring to the light , things I must write
Got to get it over with, choose
Elisa , goodbye, Elisa

The song that I sing
The times I've tried to hide it
I'm sorry to say, I'm going away
That's what I've decided on
I've tried
Elisa , goodbye, Elisa

Goodbye Elisa
Elisa goodbye
Elisa goodbye
Elisa, Elisa
If everybody had an ocean

Hee's baaacckk!
If Pit's on da job, then there's no need to worry
Dog just hurry up and wait
'cause I ain't Going no where anytime soon
Sick what these rappers wanna be?
That's me, times 2
Now
Get ready for me to take over this game
I'm cutting da flow, like I'm cutting da cane
Things will never be da same
Pause
There's a lick for 50 bricks
Now pause
And think about it
Then pause
Is it really worth it?
Then pause pause
FUCK YEAH!!!
I'm ready to go, jump in da ride
Get da mask, get da gloves
Cut off da lights, pop da gat
Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
But don't forget to pick up da prize
And upgrade the ??
If they don't give up da pies
Now
I would hate to have to calm these boys down
'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal
Why don't you just give us da keys and pounds
Now Guess What He Said?

[Chorus 2x]
Ya'll want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
Ya'll hurry up and wait! Ya'll hurry up and wait!
I've been brought up
By street cats who didn't get caught up
Like that New Jack Nino Brown at da Carter
I'm da new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
Little bit smarter!
One afternoon I came to hear
You sing a soft song into my ear
Who would have thought quite by chance
We might engage in a loving dance?

Coming together, coming apart
Lost in diversions, dancing stars
Caught in the quiet, off on our own
Coming together, standing alone

Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid

What about you, what about me?
Two years from now where will we be?
Each of us gone our separate ways
Lost in a headlong passage of days

Maybe we might give love a try
Extending the moment before "goodbye"
And for a gentle moment in time
We'll take what pleasure people can find
Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid

What is for real, what is false?
All of us seem to be caught in a waltz
Turning around, turning again
When will the dancing ever end?

As for us, you and me
Our eyes are open, we can see
Both of us know where we've been
Why must we both go dancing again?

Come join the dancing, come join the waltz
Don't look too closely at my faults
Why can't I die here in your arms?
Safe from the night and safe from the dawn

Back to the nowhere from where I came
Don't worry of me, I know what I am
Where I'm goin' and where I've been

I'm not afraid!
I'm not afraid!
No, I'm not afraid!
Yes you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
Hey you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same
Every now and then, baby, lady luck deals another hand

You're calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man
Hey you're calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your man

You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand

[Verse 1]
In my heart your love has found
The safest hiding place
Inside is a field and trees and a lake
Around is a wall, no one from hell could break

[Pre-Chorus]
In there you'll shine
In there you will cry

[Chorus]
My heart has been a lonely warrior
Who's been to war, so you can be sure
In my heart your love has found
The safest hiding place

[Verse 2]
Inside is a stream
Around is a wall no one from hell could break

[Pre-Chorus]
In there will shine the light of heaven's eye
In there you will cry

[Chorus]
My heart's been a lonely warrior
Who's been to war so you can be sure
Your love's in a sacred place
The safest hiding place

My heart has been a lonely warrior before
Who's been to war, so you can be sure

[Verse 1]
You'd be surprised, girl
Soon they'll mean nothing to you
They'll fall into their brew
And take down some of the boys with them, too
There's nothing
Nothing that you have to do

[Chorus]
In another time, girl
Your tears won't leave a trace
In another time, girl
In another place

[Verse 2]
You've been down, girl
Their whispers are hailstones in your face
You're so tired of waiting
For something to change
They don't know what to do with
Something so good
That you wouldn't hurt them
You wouldn't hurt them if you could

[Bridge]
One of these days
They're gonna fall into their brew
And they'll know exactly what they did to you
Darling, I just want you to know
Your tears won't leave a trace

[Chorus]
In another time, girl
In another time, girl
In another place

[Outro]
Darling, I just want you to know
Your tears won't leave a trace
In another time, girl
In another time, girl

Whiskey bottles and brand new cars
Oak tree you're in my way
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm (You fool, you)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink fool, would drown you (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you (Yeah, you)
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Aw, you fool, you
You stick them needles in your arm
I know I been there before

One little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix Lord, might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Oh, you fool, you
Don't stick those needles in your arm
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool
The Big Boat
(Eddie Boyd)

The big boat is at the landing
And my baby is waitin' to step on board
The big boat is at the landing

And my baby is waitin' to step on board
Yes, I know the little girl is leavin'
Oh but the reason why I just don't know

I was standin' at the landing
Crying sweet thing please don't go
I was standin' at the landing
Crying baby doll please don't go
Well, because you know I love you
Yes, I love you, woman
I love you with all my heart and soul

You know I got to find my baby
If it takes a lifetime to track her down
I got to find my baby
If it take a lifetime to track her down
I'm gonna stay on the trail of my little sweet thing
Keep her just like an old bloodhound
Love is a burning thing
Can change into a firy ring
Bound for wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

They say that love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames they went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...
Sweet smelling
Essences
Hugs and smiles
Sweet kisses
Movements
Towards me
Embrace
Reverie
Tenderness
Velvet skin
Treasured dreams
Intimate
Silk and gold
Nuit d'amour
Naked soul

After such distance
Come to me, precious being, come to me
After such ennui
Come to me, delicious, enfold me
After such a long drought
Here a place for flowers to flourish
But if you must
And if you must
If you must go, go--

The wind will take you
It will lift you
Across the ocean

Into the sky
Towards the sun
It will take you, high--

So if you must
And if you must
If you must go, go--

Sweet smelling wind
Announcing
L'amour de ma vie
When you're ready
Mon bel amour
Simply come to me
There's an airline plane
Flies to Heaven everyday
Past the Pearly Gates
If you want to ride that train
Have your ticket in your hand
Before it's too late
The world looks wrong
And your money's spent and gone
And your friend has turned away
You can get away to Heaven
On this airplane
Just bow your head and pray
Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
Take this airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
Oh, a lot of people guess
Some say no and some say yes
Takes some and leave some behind
But you will surely know
When to the airport go
To leave your sins behind
Lot of speakers speak
Lot of preachers preach
When you lay their salary on the line
Well, the only earthly way
Is to bow your head and pray
You can fly to Heaven on time
Fly to Heaven on time
Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
And take that airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
Your ticket that you obtain
On this heavenly airline plane
To leave this world behind
You've got to make that flight
May be daytime, might be night
But you can't see your way if you're blind
Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
Take that airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
My love is ever you, my love
Now and forever, you my love
You walked into my lonely world
What peace of mind your smile unfurled

Yes, and because of you, my love
My wishful dreams came true, my love
In my uncertain heart, I am only certain of
How much I love you, my love

In my uncertain heart, I am only certain of
How much I love you, my love
Turn out the light, sleep won't come
I think about what's going wrong
Lying so close, so alone
Please turn to me, I'm almost gone

Hold on, I feel our love is changing
Hold on, please don't let me disappear
Hold on, there's time to rearrange things
Hold on, I'm not me without you here

Put out your hand, touch desire

Where there's a spark, could be a fire
Open your arms, let me see
If there's still love in you for me

Hold on, I feel our love is changing
Hold on, please don't let me disappear
Hold on, there's time to rearrange things
Hold on, I'm not me without you here

[Verse 1]
To the ends of the earth
I'll follow my star
To the ends of the earth
Just to be where you are
No matter where you roam
I'll never be far behind
Who cares where the path may wind
As long as I find you?

[Verse 2]
Though the melody dies
The song lingers on
And a thousand goodbyes
Won't convince me you're gone
I'll follow you, my love
You'll never be free
To the ends of the earth
'Til you've given your love to me

[Outro]
To the ends of the earth
I'll follow my star
To the ends of the earth
Just to be where you are
No matter where you roam
I'll never be far behind
Who cares where the path may wind
As long as I find you?
Though the melody dies
The song lingers on
And a thousand goodbyes
Won't convince me you're gone
I'll follow you, my love
You'll never be free
To the ends of the earth
'Til you've given your love to me
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet
The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

I thought, as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long
The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail
The right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men

[Verse 1]
Ever since she saw you in my bedroom
Watching over me as I slept
Damn my nigga I missed you to death, yeah
And it came to a point where I couldn't hear it
But I know she don't see nothing but them good spirits
Only the good die young and not the whole squad you was a good guy huh
And if I was there I would've took them shots
You ain't even the kind of nigga that would get shot
Exclusive jay, jimmy, people open up your ears hear me
Ain't nothing worth more than a life in this world
What the fuck we was supposed to tell this man's wife and lil girl
You was a real nigga, real shit
Why niggas gotta kill niggas just to steal shit
That man's mama gonna never get her son back
But what goes around comes back

[Verse 2]
Dj I'm wishing rip still for return if possible
Couldn't go to the funeral cause I couldn't see you in the coffin bro
My last image of you, you posting in your new chevy
Camaro bit really smoke in it but you would let me
Oh my god swear to god your daughter's your spitting image
When your daughter met my daughter what a wonderful feeling
As long as the good lord ables me to get money
Put it on my daughters your daughter will never go hungry
They say they could die young if that's not false
And that explains why my homeboy's life's lost
'Cause he was a good nigga fuck ceremony
Rest in peace to trevor martin but my nigga wasn't a hood nigga
No he didn't deserve no bullets in him
I thought he was gonna live a bright hall
Them pussy could've killed him
Instead they took your life along with your sneaks
Devil u I p went in peace

[Verse 3]
Lord forgive me but why you doin' this again
You just took my big brother when I was in the pen
But how much pain can a grown man take
But I gotta keep pushing 'cause god don't make mistakes (never)
The doctors told me you was gone and I couldn't believe it
Your vital laying down but your soul in with jesus
I'm on my hole in your grind telling me come back
I told her let go 'cause wherever you are you got my back
I almost lost it when I seen that herse at the church
Shit hurt I can barely get through this verse
And I ain't rich but me and you know I ain't paper chasing
So I'ma try my best to make so that your daughters grace so
We saw the vision for the win squad together nigga
I guess it kinda drove you from heaven was better nigga
Jimmy me and you will always be your mort decoy
And wash the blood of my enemies off my hands

[Verse 4]
Tears coming down my eyes wishing for better days
Exclusive jay I know you in a better place
Never will be forgotten as long as I'm alive
You was a good dude in everybody eyes
Always on the grind you hussle hard
My prayers go out to your family from my heart
Thank you for being a friend thank you for being my brother
And I'ma do my best to look out for your daughter
No more pain god get the devil off me, and let me be free
All this stress is a mess that I don't need
Hunger games do your best or you don't eat
And my dog gonna be forever winning
So that mean your life ain't never ending
So I know I got 'em when I need 'em
Tell jesus I see him when I see him
Praise god yeah
Just tell me baby! Just tell me baby!
What can I do to change your mind?
Hey, hey, hey baby
What can I do to change your mind
I've got the blues about you baby*
You keep me worried all the time

You say you love me
I believe you do
But I think you're trying to quit me
And what more can I do?

Hey, hey, hey baby
What can I do to change your mind?
I've got the blues about you baby
You keep me worried all the time

You've got a man in the east
You've got a man in the west
I'm sitting here wondering
Which one you love the best
Hey, hey, hey baby
What can I do to change your mind?
Got the blues about you baby
Keep me worried all the time

*in the original version:
I've got the freight train blues
Baby, and the tracks are all out of line

[Long instrumental intro]

[A1]
Hotel rooms, sleep eludes me
In this strange life I lead
Occasional friends, likewise lovers
Never wanting what I need

Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
Now and then a tear rolls off my cheek

On the warm breeze the little bells
Tinkle like wind chimes
Close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes

Gone to young men every one

Gone to soldiers every one

Gone to graveyards every one

Where have all the graveyards gone
Long time passing
Where have all the graveyards gone
Long time ago
Where have all the graveyards gone
Gone to flowers every one
When will they ever learn
When will they ever learn
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize all others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
`Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love
Let's say goodbye till tomorrow
With a word sincere
How do you make it through the night?
I hope to God you're still here, I pray Olé

Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?

Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?

Can you make, can you make it through?
I pray Olé

It's a God eat God world, it's a dog's tomorrow
And the song and the wind
Brings nothing but sorrow
I pray Olé, I pray Olé, I pray Olé
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?

Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?

Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it?

Usually in the morning
I'm filled with sweet belonging
And everything is beautiful to see
Even when it's raining
The sound of heaven singing
Is simply joyful music to me

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

So many different places
A million smiling faces
Life is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you
And how it is to touch you
Oh, paradise was made for you and me

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

I know that life goes on just perfectly
Everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feel like breaking
And anywhere is where I'd rather be
Oh, and in the nighttime
I know that it's the right time
To hold you close and say "I love you so"
To have someone to share with
And someone I can care with
And that is why I wanted you to know

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
Without you
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true
May you always do for others and let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
May you stay forever young

Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young

May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth and see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young

Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young

May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful, may your songs always be sung
May you stay forever young

Forever young, forever young, may you stay forever young
Last Night
I lost the best friend I ever had
Last Night
I lost the best friend I ever had
You know she gone, she gone and left me
That made me feel, feel so bad

Now it's early in the morning
And my love is comin' down for you
Early in the morning
And my love is comin' down for you
I want you to tell me, tell me, tell me baby, now
What in the world are we gonna do

If she don't come back
I don't know what I'm gonna just do
If she don't never come back
I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do
'Cause she's gone and left me
Left me to see the whole night through
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
And then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run

If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
Till you're back, back beside me, till I'm holding you
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms

Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forevermore I'll wait for you

I got my gear in my pack
I got my pack on my back
Today's the day I'm going camping

Just got the go ahead sign
The weather's gonna be fine
Today's the day I'm going camping
I'm gonna pitch me a tent

Won't have to pay any rent
It looks like ev'rything is "A O.K."
As far as I can see
I think it's gonna be a perfect camping day

The trees and animals
And clear blue skies
A waterfall comes tumbling right before my eyes
Birds that fly above a mountain stream
It's absolutely perfect better than a dream
Peace and quiet where the Good Lord smiled
Fields and fields of flowers growing wild
This is just where I belong I'm a mother Nature's child
It's time to hit the trail
To hit the hill and dale
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains

It's great to reach the snow
And see the world below
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains
Each time we stop to eat

We get to rest our feet
And we'll make it if we take slow
'Cause the best way to climb
Is one step at a time and hicking is the only way to go

I got my gear in my pack
The trees and animals
It's time to hit the trail

I got my pack on my back
And clear blue skies
To hit the hill and dale

Today's the day I'm going camping
A waterfall comes tumbling right before my eyes
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains
Just got the go ahead sign
Birds that fly
It's great to reach the snow
The weather's gonna be fine
Above a moun-tain stream
And see the world below
Today's the day I'm goin' camping
It's absolutely perfect better than a dream
Oh, I love hiking in the mountains

I'm gonna pitch me a tent Won't
Peace and quiet
Each time we stop to eat

Have to pay any rent
Where the Good Lord smiled
We get to rest our feet

It looks like ev'rything is "A O. K."
Fields and fields of flowers growing wild
And we'll make it if we take it slow

As far as I can see
This is
'Cause the best way to climb

I think it's gonna be
Just where I belong
Is one step at a time

A perfect camping day
I'm a mother Nature's child

One day U'll see that I'm the best

If I am good then U are (accessible)

Where little boys give up, a good man sticks around ... yes he does!

[Governor]
Hustlin... out here...

[Chorus: Governor]
I'm out here, hustlin
I'm just thinkin 'bout gettin back home to you babe
I'm out here, hustlin
You see that's how I'm able to send that little money to you
Hustlin - let's get more freedom
In my future, so we can ball (out here)
So we can sip champagne, and puff that mary jane
And you can fly first class on an airplane

[T.I.]
Jeah, ay, let's go man
I remember comin up, used to hate to get on the bus
Dreams of gettin paid and makin the big bucks
Started to get a little then couldn't get enough
Let me in, I'ma win nigga I don't give a fuck
The environment sucks but the bread ain't bad
The broads, don't fuck 'em all but the head ain't bad
I'm young, rich and legit; think the Feds ain't mad?
Haters are sick of the Six, so scared of the scad
Dag, damn nigga ya ain't have to brag
This'll never pay, remember when you said that bad?
The nigga still thinkin I blew up so fast
J. Geter, remember when you put up yo' last?
This for my niggas tryin to flip yo' cash
'fore the Feds can get a chance to clip yo' ass
Get a lot of powder in a Ziplock bag
Wrist full of rubber bands, 40-cal's in the dash

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Yo ay, ay, let me holla at 'em Gov'..
I know some people love me to death and there's some that can't stand me
Cause I got a big ass crib in Miami (what else?)
Another out in Cali, backyard so sandy (okay)
And most broads find it hard to understand me
But the same attitude that make crews goddamn me
Is the same ones that got me lookin cool at the Grammy's
Haters wanna damage me but King you'll never be
Shawty holla at me when you get your first felony
Then holla at me when you've been on Dave Letterman
Say they never seen a real nigga so elegant
Lames wanna hear that real shit and I'm tellin it
Trained the game to be sold and I'm sellin it
Chasin a Honda mil', that bullshit is irrelevant
We can race if you wanna, I bet on me and you'll never win
Simply cause a loser's somethin I've never been
If you doubt now holla back at 2007 then

[Chorus]

[Governor]
Hustlin... out here...
Hustlin... out here... 

[echoes]
Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and everyday
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find away?
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away
(Intro:)
Yeah, that boy Gucci
Got my nigga block in this bitch
East Atlanta's finest
E.C.T South!

(Chorus: Gucci Mane)
Early in the morning Nigga Imma be up
Imma be up, Imma be up;
Call Block or Gucci Mane when it's time to re-up
It's time to re-up It's time to re-up;
7:30 in the morning, Nigga we gon' be up
We gon' be up, we gon' be up;
Call Block or Gucci Mane when it's time to re-up
It's time to re-up, it's time to re-up;

(Verse 1: Yatta Mann)
Boys what it do?
Nigga getcha g's up
Dope man bitch!
Call me Mr.Re-Up
The kitchen smells like fish, the fish scale dog
1000 Grams at a time on the Digiscale ow!
.45 Mac
Rubber band stacks
Spent a ½ a mill wit Papi watch how fast I get it back
The dope boys love me
Taught'em how to cook
You whip it real hard, cold water, let it drop
The dope man bitch!
Sold bricks, sold rocks
100 thousand dollars, fell like I shot a cop
The dope man bitch!
Sold grams, sold white
Cook the work 10 minutes
Fiends gave me 5 pipes
New York nigga's love how I work that turn pipe
Got Micheal Jackson yay
Powder 10, but it cook white
I don't get nervous when I ride them highways
Dope man bitch!
Everyday is my birthday!
(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Gucci Mane)
I got the city on lock!
Have you ever seen a ¼ million dollars in a Nike shoe box?
I can show you how to trap!
100 grand worth of cap
And I pray that my phone ain't tapped!
Nigga buy for the smell of it
Bought a hard top 6 and I sat it on spree's for the hell of it
7 on the dot!
Got some cain and its jumping out the pot!
I'm in the game so I give it all I got
To a million dollar spot
I got a rainbow Range same color as lean
Wit the matching rims on it, man that bitch so clean
Gotta skittle Drop Jag and a fruity Chevelle
If I drop the top back, bubble kush you gon' smell
Every flip I cop another whip
Every trap I cop another chain
Every play I cop another tool
What these nigga's know bout Gucci Mane?
Notta damn thang!
I'm icy, something like a polar bear
When your girl give me brain better hold her hair
100 Grand in the bag just to make you stare
Re-up wit the man
Gucci Mane Lil'Flap
(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Gucci Mane)
Go with our rental cars
Used to serve hard to Mountain Park;
Now I stand behind the burglar bars
Say Lil'Breeze best smoke ya gars;
I'm the hustler of the century
When you think of money mention me
I said my buddy get it to the key
From Arkansas to Tennessee
Every Brick, Pill. And every "P"
Some how it doesn't come from me
I'm on T.V gettin interviewed
Still got them thangs in the intertubes
8 grand for the good purp
A t-shirt, under my t-shirt
Aye lock it up, that's a bad word
You had to whip it till your wrist hurt
You shoulda holler'd at Gucci or Block
Got'chu a dime to a ½ a block
I'm knocked diamonds and I never stop
Disturbing cocaine; duckin cops

(Chorus)

[Verse 1]
It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to break a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 2]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I think you might like to know
That the singer's gonna to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So may I introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Back, before I said goodbye
Just as the first day turned to night
Just as the concrete turned to dust
And the steel turned into rust

All I could think was a new way to dig through the damage
Couldn't think of a way to get through this
Now, I see you taking advantage
And I find another reason to do this

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm digging us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
You're gonna have to follow me under it

Let go, it's begun
Close your eyes, I'm not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Now, that I said goodbye
Just as the darkness turned to light
Just as the next light turns to day
And the world gets underway

All I can see is the anticipation
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops
And I waited patiently, taking it in
Ready for the first of the face-off's

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm digging us a hole to travel through
I wanna find a way to rattle you
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
You're gonna have to follow me under it

Let go, it's begun
Close your eyes, I'm not done
Breathe a word and waste your breath
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(I...) I'm digging us a hole to travel through
(I...) I wanna find a way to rattle you
(You...) You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
(You...) You're gonna have to follow me under it

(I...) I'm digging us a hole to travel through
(I...) I wanna find a way to rattle you
(You...) You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
(You...) You're gonna have to follow me under it

(I...) I'm digging us a hole to travel through
(I...) I wanna find a way to rattle you
(You...) You wanna try to hear the thunder hit?
(You...) You're gonna have to follow me under it

(I...) Let go, it's begun
(I...) Close your eyes, I'm not done
(You...) Breathe a word and waste your breath
(You...) And keep it up 'til there's nothing left

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1: Gerald LeVert]
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the ever lasting arms
If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly

[Verse 2: Yolanda Adams]
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes the silence could seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first it's got to start inside of me
If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it

[Chorus]
Cuz I believe in me, yea,yea,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

[Yolanda Adams]
If I can see it

[Gerald LeVert]
Then I can do it

[Yolanda Adams]
If I just believe it

[Gerald LeVert]
There's nothing to it, oh

[Chorus]
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I can do anything yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly
I can do anything, yeah, yeah, yeah

Anything I wanna do (Anything I wanna do)
Anything I wanna do (Anything I wanna do)
Anything I wanna do (Anything I wanna do)
I can do anything
I can fly

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
But you just think the same way
Get like you used to be

[Verse 2]
You're loving so many women, every one you see
You're loving too many women, every one you see
We never get much time together
Get like you used to be

[Verse 3]
There's no one in the world, no one else for me
There's no one in the world, no one else for me
But I think I'm gonna start looking, baby
So get like you use to be

[Verse 4]
Oh, love me but don't leave
Love me, baby, but don't you grieve me
Oh, baby, you used to mean so much to me
I wanna get my arms around you, baby
So get like you used to be

[Verse 1]
It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make-up mirror
Liquid soap and grass
And Jungle Gardenia crash
On Pine-Sol and beer
It's stifling in here
I've got to get some air
I'm going outside to get some air

[Verse 2]
Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down
They're such sky-oriented people
Geared to changing weather
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off
I'm floating off in time

[Verse 3]
When I was three feet tall
And wide-eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's General Store
All in their beaded leathers
I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum
I'd beat the drum like war

[Verse 4]
But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off
I'm floating into my dreams

[Chorus]
I dream paprika plains
Vast and bleak and God forsaken
Paprika plains
And a turquoise river snaking
(Where crows gaze vigilant on wires
Where cattle graze the grasses
Far from the digits of business hours
The moon clock wanes and waxes
But here all time is stripped away
Nowhere on these plains
Is a sprout or an egg in evidence
To measure loss or gain
Only a little Indian band
Come down from some windy mesa
No women to make them food and child
No expressions on their faces
I'm low in a helicopter
And the wind from whirling blades
Flaps their woven blankets
And flags their raven braids
How came they to this emptiness?
How came they to this dream?
How came I to this view
From a flying machine
Of earth and air and water
And a band of Indian men
Without herds or flocks or crops
Or families or fires to tend?
Like a phoenix up from ashes now
A blanket figure springs
With a fist raised up to turquoise skies
Like liberty
And at the point of vanishing
Where the sky and the earth meet
A bomb blooms
Deadly mushroom
White
Gold
Heat
Like a phoenix up from ashes
Up from violent mysteries
And growing 'till the giant blast
Is to it like a golfer's tee
There comes a child's beach ball
And memory takes me back
To the beach to toss it up
To the garage to get it patched
A pink and yellow beach ball
Rolling
Grand
Detached
Turning the blues and greens of earth
From space probe photographs
I float out of the hovercraft
Naked as infancy
And weightless
And drifting
Horizontally
Like a filing to a magnet
Like the long descent of rain
I am drawn
I fall against the ball
And lose paprika plains
I suckle at my mother's breast
I embrace my mother earth
I remember perforated blinds
Over the crib of my birth
And just as Eve succumbed
To reckless curiosity
I take my sharpest fingernail
And slash the globe to see
Below me
Vast Paprika plains
And the snake the river traces
And a little band of Indian men
With no expressions on their faces.)

[Verse 5]
The rain retreats
Like troops to fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor
I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire from J&B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back
I'm coming back for more

[Verse 6]
The band plugs in again
You see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights and spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back
I'm floating back to you
You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, baby, it seems to me
You'd love to see me cryin'

I don't know why I stay home
Each night when you say that you'll phone
You don't, and I'm left alone
Singin' the blues 'n' cryin'

You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me whenever somebody is near

It must be
Great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't 'cause can't you see what you mean to me?

You treat me coldly every day in the year
And you always scold me whenever somebody is near

Gee, it must be
Great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't 'cause can't you see what you mean to me?
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Woah now

Red, red, red, redder than red
Said I'm redder than red
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread
I get dreader than dread now

I forward on the scene
I'll do it real keen
Red, red, red, redder than red
I won't do no wrong

I'll always be beside you
Protecting by you
I'll never let you down
You can wear my crown
I'll be true to love you girl
I'll never tell no lie
'Cause I don't want to see those
Tears from your eyes
I'm red, red, red, redder than red
Did you dig it?
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread
I'm dreader than dread now

I won't do no wrong
I'll be a free man
Red, red, red, redder than red
Yes I am

I'll never hurt you
Never let you down
I'll stand always beside you
Oh, oh
I'll be true to the people
Who I love
I'll never hurt them
Woah now, woah now

Red, red, red, redder than red
Redder than red
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread
That's it, say I am red
Red, red, red, redder than red
Redder than red now
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread
Can I be dreader than dread
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread
Uh, every morning, every night
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread
Groove, groove, out of sight, out, oh God
Red, red, red, redder than red
'Cause I'm, oooooh
Dread, dread, dread, dreader than dread

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
Some people will always have it made
Some people will live in poverty for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is dead and gone
Life is uncertain, let me hear you say (Yeah)
Death is final, yes it is
There'll be days of sunshine and laughter
But don't forget you gonna have to shed some tears, oh ho

[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
It's the law of the land (My brother, oh)
Whether you like it or you'll understand (Ah hey hey)
It's the law of the land (Hey hey hey hey)
Laws made by almighty man

[Verse 2: Dennis Edwards]
Live by the good book if you're able
You must play your cards on top of the table
When you gamble you either win or lose
In life's everybody's got to pay some dues - well

[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
It's the law of the land (Well well well)
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand (You can't change it)
It's the law of the land (Ah-how)
Laws made by almighty man (Oh, hey)

[Break]

[Bridge]
Hey, it's the law, the law of the land
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand
It's the law, the law of the land
Was made by almighty men

[Verse 3: Dennis Edwards]
A peace of mind can't be found
Until you find yourself - think about it
You might not like being who you are but you better start liking it
'Cause you sure can't be nobody else
In other words: I can't be you - ain't no way, yeah - you can't be me
Well well, that's all with you, my sisters and brother
And that's the way that good Lord meant to be - hey-ho

[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
It's the law of the land (Well)
Whether you like it or you'll understand (Say say)
It's the law of the land (Hey)
Laws made by almighty man

[Verse 4: Dennis Edwards]
Looka here
The course of a man's day is driven by a cup
For your own protection your doors you must lock
What goes around comes around
You know what goes up, yeah, must come down - ah-ha

[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
It's the law of the land (Well well well well)
Whether you like it or you'll understand
(Everybody sing along with me)
It's the law of the land (Well well well)
Laws made by almighty man (Ah-ha)
It's the law of the land
In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Cause I really love you
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night (in the still of the night)
I remember (I remember) that night in May (I remember)
The stars were bright (I remember) above (I remember)
I'll hope (I remember) and I'll pray (I remember)
To keep your precious love
Well before the dawn's light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night (in the still of the night)
I remember (I remember) that night in May (I remember)
The stars were bright (I remember) above (I remember)
I'll hope (I remember) and I'll pray (I remember)
To keep your precious love
Well before the dawn's light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night (in the still of the night)
In the still of the night
Everybody has the right to be wrong at least once
Everybody has the right to be dunce-like, once-like
Not being too smart is, is no disgrace
What sets you apart is smilin' with egg on your face

Its naive to make believe that you're right, it's not bright
Only fools go walking on thin ice, twice

You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along
All it takes is simply saying you're wrong when you're wrong
And everybody has the right to be wrong

You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along
All it takes is simply sayin' you're wrong when you're wrong
And everybody has the right to be
It can be a real delight to be
And I'd fight, fight for the right to be wrong

"At least once!!"

[Verse 1]
You wanna make Van Goghs, raise 'em up like sheep
Make 'em out of Eskimos and women if you please
Make 'em nice and normal, make 'em nice and neat
You see him with his shotgun there, bloodied in the wheat?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, what do you know
About living in turbulent indigo?

[Verse 2]
Brash fields, crude crows in a scary sky
In a golden frame, roped-off, tourists guided by
Tourists talking about the madhouse, talking about the ear
The madman hangs in fancy homes they wouldn't let him near

[Chorus 2]
He'd piss in their fireplace
He'd drag them through turbulent indigo

[Verse 3]
I'm a burning hearth, he said, people see the smoke
But no one wants to warm themselves, sloughing off a coat
And all my little landscapes, all my yellow afternoons
Stack up around this vacancy like dirty cups and spoons

[Chorus 3]
No mercy, sweet Jesus
No mercy from turbulent indigo
Verse 1:
The summer smiles, the summer knows, and unashamed, she sheds her clothes
The summer smoothes the restless sky
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie
The summer knows, the summer's wise, she sees the doubts within your eyes

And so she takes her summertime, tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twist the world around her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of it all
And if you learned your lesson well

There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall
Writer(s): Cahn/van Heusen

If the lady's naughty but proper
If the lady's chic-er than chic
If her escorts must wear a topper
And each man's the man of the week
If she rides around in a brand new foreign car
The chances are the lady's a star

If the lady's utterly charming
If the lady's chummy with kings
If her whims are close to alarming
And it's known she's thrown a few things
If they've got a drink with her name in Jilly's bar
The chances are the lady's a star

If her smallest party is really extensive
With tons of expensive caviar

If the lady is someone with the same credentials
Someone with the same essentials
Someone who is worshipped from afar
She's a genuine - positive - totally - marvelous - perfectly - wonderful
She's a (great big, great big) star!
Ooh ooh ooh
When you wait and you watch
And you're wishing for something wild
I figure I can please you someday someway
I figure I can put your love on trial
I'm taking you back to school
Talk about making it something real
Nobody could deny you anything

You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you

You you you
You can run with the fun
You can tickle my nerves inside
In the face of heartbreak, heartache
It's gonna be a magic carpet ride
Better we make it soon
Let it be the one that make you
Cry for more
Anyone else would buy you anything
I'd do anything
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you

I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'd do anything

You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you
You know I'd do anything
Anything for you

I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'd do anything

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
You surely must know magic girl
Because you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see, girl
Just knowin' your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin' in on me, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
Baby, you're part of every thought I think each day
Your name is in every phrase my lips say
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldn't live without you

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin]
Baby (Baby), baby (Baby), baby
You're my everything, you're my everything, yes you are
(You're my everything, girl)

[Verse 4: Eddie Kendricks]
You're the girl I sing about
In every love song I sing
(You're my everything)
You're my winter baby
My summer, my fall and spring
(You're my everything)

[Pre-Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin]
You're my everything, you're my everything, yes you are
(When my way was dark, and troubles were near, don't you know baby, that you're my everything)
(Don't you know you're my everything)
You're my everything, you're my everything
(Don't you know you're my everything)
You're my everything, you're my everything
Y'all niggas is dead, dead!
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Face illest street niggas, illest rap niggas
It's murda!

Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you

Yo, shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
F**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
GRRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!
Uh! Dark man! DMX! Ruff Ryders! Def Jam!
I once lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money I didn't care
Always taking my friends out for a good time
Buying champagne, gin and wine
But just as soon as my dough got low
I couldn't find a friend, no place I go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it
Till the eagle grins

Nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And your friends, you haven't any
And as soon as you get on your feet again
Everybody is your long lost friend
It's mighty strange, without a doubt, but
Nobody wants you when you're down and out

You know folks, I once had a mansion
Way up on the side of a hill
I'd give champagne and caviar parties
Just for fun and get a thrill
But you know things they just can't stay like that forever
And now I can't muscle up enough money
To buy a shot of gin
But you know, if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it till the eagle grins
It's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out

Don't Say U Love Me
(Don’t say U love me) {x3}
If ever there was a girl of contradiction, baby, that girl is U
One minute U are a stranger, the next U’re my guru
How I miss those moments when I’d crawl into your arms
We were perfect lovers then, what happened 2 your charm?
Don’t say that U love me, baby, cuz I don’t wanna know
Our love is like a roller coaster, up and down we go
Don’t say U love me, I’m sick of this push and pull
U can’t even love yourself so 2 love me, U’re incapable
Don’t say U love me, I am not a fool
Say anything, just please don’t say U love me
I’ve been so naive and blind 2 think U’d do no wrong
Yes, I’m still a dreamer, but the little boy is gone
U used 2 hug me, kiss me, touch me, lick me, fill me with your charm
Then my credit card was in your hand and U say don’t be alarmed? (Whoa!)
Don’t say that U love me, baby, cuz I don’t wanna know
Our love is like a roller coaster, up and down we go
Don’t say U love me, I’m sick of this push and pull
U can’t even love yourself so 2 love me, U’re incapable
Don’t say U love me cuz I am not a fool
Say anything, just please don’t say U love me
Locked in your prison, I forgot about me
But now, my dear, I am here 2 tell U I am free
This little story is not 4 your glory
It’s time 2 pack your bags and don’t forget 2 leave the key
Don’t say U love me
Say anything, just don’t say U love me
If ever there was a girl of contradiction, baby, that girl is U
One minute U are a stranger, the next U’re my guru
U used 2 hug me, kiss me, touch me, lick me, fill me with all your charms
That was then, this is now
Don’t say U love me cuz I don’t wanna know
Our love is like a roller coaster, up and down we go
Don’t say U love me, I’m sick of this push and pull
U can’t even love yourself, 2 love me, U’re incapable
Don’t say U love me {x3}
Say anything, just please don’t say U love me
Don’t say that U love me, baby, cuz I am not a fool
Say anything, just please don’t say U love me
No, I don’t wanna hear it, just go!
Don’t say U love me
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Version on Seasons Greetings:
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Won't you please have snow
And mistletoe
And presents under the tree for me
For me

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
(Some other version:)
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were blue

You'll never know, dear, how much I loved you
How could you take my sunshine away?
Rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby
Like my back ain't got no bones

Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
I want you to roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby
You don't know how it makes me feel

Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow
Yeah, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby
Till I want no more
At my window, sad and lonely
Oft' times do I think of thee
Sad and lonely and I wonder
Do you ever think of me?
Every day is sad and lonely
And every night is sad and blue
Do you ever think of me my darling?
As you sail that ocean blue
At my window, sad and lonely
I stand and look across the sea
And I sad and lonely wonder
Do you ever think of me?
Will you find another sweetheart?
In some far and distant land
Sad and lonely now I wonder
If our boat will ever land
Ships may ply the stormy ocean
And planes may fly the stormy sky
I'm sad and lonely but remember
Oh, I'll love you till I die
When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark

When you walk through a storm
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Wave that flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat
Trap the rat, bell the cat
Ball the jack, chew the fat

Shoot the breeze, lose the keys
Feed the poor, starve the war
Read the signs, connect the lines
Pay your fines, save your dime

Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done come and gone, my oh my

Eat at Dave's, read the raves
Hides in caves, walk on waves
Pull the tooth, stretch the truth

Catch the fix, get your kicks
Play it next, pick up sticks
Trim your wick, try your tricks
Impress the chicks
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done come and gone, my oh my

[Instrumental break]

Wash the fence, dig the den
Live in shame, die in vain
Catch the flu, burn the stew
Shinin' shoes, sing the blues

Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done come and gone, my oh my
Summertime done come and gone, my oh my
My oh my oh my oh my oh my
Summertime done come and gone, my oh my
"The victims are what mean the most to us and that we cared so much about...."
"I just really feel that we are going to be known as the school that overcame"

I know you're feeling pain right now
And you don't wanna talk right now
I know you're going through something
And you don't wanna be bothered right now
Not gonna lie and say I understand
I just wanna be here for you if I can
To hold your hand and be by your side
And together we will get through these times

And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together

Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up
Now I know the burdens that you've had
And you don't think nobody cares
A storm comes out of nowhere
And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the private side, no
Cause I understand and now is not the time
See I just wanna help you make it right
Walk with you, holding the candle light

And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together

Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up

You see struggle so hard
No color, no color
And you missed the price
You are my sister
I'm your brother
And side by side we'll face this thing
Standing tall, you and me
Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise

Hey we gon' rise

Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise

Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up

Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up

Shoo doo doo doo
Shoo doo doo doo doo
Yes

[Verse 1]
I look into my eyes
To see the change in me
It's deep down in my soul, mmm
I look into my eyes
To feel the love in me
For you and you alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, how can love like ours begin again?
I'd give anything to hold you again
Oh, ooh, baby

[Chorus]
If I give you my heart
Can we make a new start?
Will you still love me, girl
Will you love me, girl?
(Will you still love me, baby?)
If I give you my heart (Yeah)
Though we've drifted apart
Will you still love me, girl?
Will you love me, girl?
(Will you love me, baby? Yeah)
Will you still love me, girl
Mmm, girl, if I give you my heart?

[Verse 2]
Oh, listen to my voice
To hear the need in me
For you and only you
Oh, listen to my voice
If you believe in me
You know my words are true

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep aching, baby, send me a sign (Send me a sign)
I'd give anything to know you're still mine
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
If I give you my heart (Give you my heart)
Can we make a new start? (Oh yeah)
Will you still love me, girl
Will you love me, girl?
(Will you still love me, baby? Oh yeah)
If I give you my heart (Hoo hoo hoo hoo)
Though we've drifted apart (Drifted apart)
Will you still love me, girl?
Will you love me, girl?
(Will you still love me, baby?)
Will you still love me, girl
Mmm, girl, if I give you my heart?

[Spoken Bridge]
Oh, girl, remember when we used to go to the movies?
Holding hands
I remember those times, darling
I just think that we should do those things again
Just give me a brand new start
Would you do that for me, darling?
Please

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been missing you so much I could scream (I could scream)
There's got to be a chance for this dream
Oh

[Chorus]
If I give you my heart
Can we make a new start? (Oh baby)
Will you still love me, girl
Will you love me, girl?
(I said will you still love me, girl?)
If I give you my heart (Hey)
Though we've drifted apart
Will you still love me, girl?
Will you love me, girl?
Will you still love me, girl
(Will you love me just a little bit? Oh yeah)
If I give you my heart (Give you my heart)
Can we make a new start? (Oh baby)
Will you still love me, girl
Will you love me, girl?
(Love me like you did last year, baby, oh oh oh yeah)
If I give you my heart (Yeah)
Though we've drifted apart
Will you still love me, girl?
Will you love me, girl?
(Say you love me, baby, ay hey hey hey)
Will you still love me, girl?
(Will you still love me, baby?)
Will you still love me, girl?
Girl

[Outro]
Girl, yes, if I give you my heart
Oh, come, oh, come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!
Oh, come, O key of David, come
And open wide our heav'nly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!
Oh, come, oh, come our Lord of might
Who to your tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times gave holy law
In cloud and majesty and awe
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!
Wash your face before your faded make-up makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never comes so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirror's hung up on you
Don't be last, your friends and your reflection
It's all so direction now
Poor Harlequin, you're quite an exception
Fay troubadour, on a downer
Gay Harlequin, doesn't believe in you
Doesn't believe it's true, such a downer

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 3]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 4]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Blue Jay Way Transition]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Well I've heard lots of people say
They're gonna settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along

I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right

Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home
You got that right
Well you got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right
I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice
You got that right
Sure got that right
Travellin' around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travellin' jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Well you got that right
Sure got that right

[he]
Got the cutest little way
Like to watch you all the day
And it certainly seems fine
Just to think that you'll be mine
When I see your pretty smile
Makes the living worth the while
So I've got to run around
Telling people what I've found

[Boy]
And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me. They didn't believe me!
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loviest girl that one could see!
And when I tell them
And I cert'nly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me. They'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me!

[she]
Don't know how it happened quite
May have been the summer night
May have been, well, who can say
Things just happen any way
All I know is I said "yes!"
Hesitating more or less
And you kissed me where I stood
Just like any fellow would

[Girl]
And when I told them how wonderful you are
They didn't believe me. They didn't believe me!
Your lips, your eyes, your curly hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest thing that one could see!
And when I tell them
And I cert'nly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the girl whose boy one day you'll be
They'll never believe me. They'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me!
I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've been so bad, I'm all alone

I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone
All right... (guitar solo)

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Oh baby, come on stay with me
Yes baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Oh baby I'm all alone
Oh baby I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin' since my baby been gone

[Verse 1]
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me, blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond, beyond, beyond
No return, no return
I'm deranged
Deranged down, down, down
I'm deranged down, down, down
So cruise me, babe, cruise me, babe, beyond

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby

[Verse 2]
The clutch of life
And the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby

[Outro]
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the…
Let me tell you bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every morning fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
So I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know shell go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile and tell them she told me so
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

If I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
Tells me every thing will be alright
So why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
In the evenin', Mama, when the sun goes down
In the evenin', Mama, when the sun goes down
Ain't it so lonesome, ain't it so lonesome
When your love was not around when the sun goes down

Well, I lay awake at night
Well, I'm just thinkin' to myself
Oh, I lay awake at night
Oh, I'm just thinkin' to myself
Oh, don't it hurt so bad
When your love was lovin' someone else
When the sun goes down

[Instrumental break]

When the sun rises in the east
When it sets down in the west
When the sun rises in the east, now, Mama
When it sets down in the west
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
Which woman'll love you the best
When the sun goes down

[Instrumental break]

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh, when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm going to get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

[Chorus]
The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah
Uh-huh, mhm

[Verse 2]
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This Christmas

[Chorus]
The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas, will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

[Bridge]
It's gonna be a special Christmas, oh
Ooh, hey, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Oh, the fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas, will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

[Outro]
It's gonna be a special Christmas
Shake a hand, shake a hand
It's gonna be a special Christmas
I've got you, baby, oh
Merry Christmas time
I love you
This Christmas

[Verse 1]
Six o'clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissing Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late 'cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days when you wish your bed was already made

[Chorus]
It's just another manic Monday (Ohh, ohh)
I wish it was Sunday (Ohh, ohh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ohh, ohh)
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

[Verse 2]
Have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine
If I had an aeroplane, I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there

[Chorus]
It's just another manic Monday (Ohh, ohh)
I wish it was Sunday (Ohh, ohh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ohh, ohh)
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

[Bridge]
All of the nights, why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night we got down)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down (Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh)
But when she tells me in her bedroom voice
"Come on, honey, let's go make some noise" (I can't resist)
Time, it goes so fast (When you're having fun)

[Outro]
It's just another manic Monday (Ohh, ohh)
I wish it was Sunday (Ohh, ohh)
'Cause that's my fun day (Ohh, ohh)
It's just another manic Monday
Did you say (that) I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
You'd better teach me tonight

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two
Hey teach me tonight
I who thought I knew the score of it
Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
Hey teach me tonight

The midnight hours come slowly creeping
When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

What I need most is post graduate
What I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate
You'd better teach me tonight

What do you get for lessons
Teach me - come on and teach me - teach me tonight
Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day
Be a simple man
Take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
Go find your woman and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above
And be a simple kind of man
Be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple, be a simple man
Won't you do this for me, son, if you can?
Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied
And be a simple, be a simple man
Be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Won't you do this for me, son, if you can?
Yes, I will
Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothin' else
And you can do this if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied
And be a simple kind of man
Be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Won't you do this for me, son, if you can?
Baby, be a simple kind of man
I'm bringing me home to you
It's all that I have to give
My life, my love, my everything
It's you I choose to be with

Had a wonderful time in the city
I smile when I recall
The space, the songs, the company
I really had a ball
It's a funny set of circumstances
Sends me out on the road alone
With the moon looking over my shoulder
I'm finding my way back home

I'm bringing me home to you
It's all that I have to give
My life, my love, my everything
It's you I choose to be with

Riding high in the Rocky Mountains
It's a quiet and peaceful time
I'd swear the stars are smiling
Like they know what's on my mind
You see on any such an occasion
My thoughts will turn to you
The time I spend all by myself
I mostly spend with you
I'm bringing me home to you
It's all that I have to give
My life, my love, my everything
It's you I choose to be with

Lalala la la la la la lala, lalala la la la la lala
Lalala la la la la la lala, lalala la la laaa

When I laid down beside you
All the love that you show
I want to live my life with you
It's all the dreams that I know

I'm bringing me home to you
It's all that I have to give
My life, my love, my everything
It's you I choose to be with
It's you I choose to be with
It's you I want to live with

Lalala la la la la la lala, lalala la la la la lala
Lalala la la la la la lala, lalala la la laaa

[Intro]
You go first...
That's all you got
Listen...

[Verse 1]
Cut me, cut me with your tongue, then love me when its over
You don't even know just how much you taunt me
Taunting and provoking, keep words unspoken
Pandora's box is open

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame brings pain
Accusations seal these walls
Walls built up to shield from pain
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop

[Chorus]
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe

[Verse 2]
Piercing, piercing with my actions, spitefully ignore you
I don't even care just how much you take
Bitten and it's potent, you hate it and I know it
Pandora's box is open

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame brings pain
Accusations seal these walls
Walls built up to shield from pain
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop

[Chorus]
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe

[Bridge]
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
It won't ever come down
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
It won't ever come down
'Round and 'round like the game roulette
Step on up, kid, and place your bet
'Round and 'round is the route we choose
Play that game, man, we all gon' lose
'Round and 'round like the game roulette
Step on up, kid, and place your bet
'Round and 'round is the route we choose
Play that game, man, we all gon' lose

[Chorus]
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby
Just like I know a good man should
You know I'm free, free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
Teenage darling, please be true
Teenage darling, I love only you
Teenage darling, teenage darling you're my girl
You caught me in a world

Teenage darling, please say you'll be mine
Now and forever, until the end of time

Teenage darling, you're my girl
Teenage darling, I love you so
Teenage darling, don't ever go
Plead on my love and on my heart
I want you to promise that we will never part

Teenage darling, you're my queen
Teenage darling, you're just sweet sixteen
Teenage darling, you're the answer to all my dreams
Oh what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future?
Say the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner?
Say the black bells of Rhondda
And who robbed the miner?
Say the big bells of Blaina

They will plunder willy-nilly
Say the bells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth
Shout the loud bells of Neath
Even God is uneasy
Say the moist bells of Swansea
And what will you give me?
Say the bad bells of Rhymney

Throw the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport
All would be well, if, if, if, if
Say the green bells of Cardiff
Why so worried, sister, why?
Say the silver bells of Wye
And what will you give me?
Say the bad bells of Rhymney
You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder
Can't you see the party's over
Let me go
Can't you get it through your thick head
This affair is finished - dead
Hey, let me go
I tried giving you the velvet gloves
I tried giving you the knockout punch
Hey, let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
I find it hard to be cruel
I find it hard to be cruel
With a smile, don't you?
You'll never find that perfect love
That you read about
That you dream about
Maybe I'll become a playboy
Hang around in gay bars
And move to the west side of town
You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder
Can't you see the party's over
Hey, let me go
Let me go
So you think I'm giving you the brush off
Well I'm just telling you to shove off
Hey, let me go
This ain't no time to waste my breath
We're going into sudden death
Hey, let me go
Can't you get it through your thick head
This affair is dead as a doornail
Hey, baby won't you let me go
The bell has rung, and I've called time
The chair is on the table, out the door baby
Baby won't you let me go
Let me go...
Take my blessings with you when you go
I don't wanna know no more
Head to toe, from top to bottom I've been kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no more

I'll be thinking of you when you go
Take a walk along the shore
Why should I pretend that nothing is the matter now?
Don't wanna be kicked around no more

My life could be so sweet
I can't remember when I started running
The water underneath the bridge can't keep a secret
She's still running home

Take my blessing with you when you go
To the next one you adore, ooh
Head to toe, and top to bottom I've been kicked around
Ain't gonna be kicked around no more

Don't wanna be kicked around
Ain't gonna be kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no more
My life could be so sweet
I can't remember when I started running
The water underneath the bridge can't keep a secret
I'm not running now

Take my blessing with you when you go
I don't wanna know no more
Head to toe, from top to bottom I've been kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no more

Don't wanna be kicked around
Ain't gonna be kicked around
Don't wanna be kicked around no more
Verse:
It's not that you're fairer
Than a lot of girls just as pleasin'
That I doff my hat
As a worshipper at your shrine
It's not that you're rarer
Than asparagus out of season
No, my darling, this is the reason
Why you've got to be mine

Chorus:
You'd be so nice to come to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise, to come home to and love
I may go and move to the jungle now
Way out in the woods
Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle people
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
I work hard everyday
From Monday to Friday night

The wages that they pay me
I swear that they're very light
The take out a little for the state
A little more for Uncle Sam

How can I ever catch up
And get myself out of this jam
Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
I go to town on Saturday
Just to pay my bills
I better make it early
Or the collector will come where I live
I got to church on a Sunday
I get on my knees to pray

Preacher takes up collection
And say brother what will you pay
I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
You're so sleepy
Wish that he could stay
Love him so
But now it's getting late

He'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
One more summer
And your dream comes true
Your world was not the kind
I ever thought I'd find
Myself to be a part of
Oh, but here I stand
In the middle of a foreign land
A stranger with love in his heart

Mmmmm, for love has no eyes
It comes in no disguise
It's free for those who want to share

And I've chosen you to be mine
So girl let's not waste no time
Let's not worry 'bout what they say
Let's take care of what is ours today

Sail on white moon
Across the dark and starry sky
Sail on white moon
Our love won't die
But girl you must realize
There be a difference in our lives
We're gonna be rejected
Oh, but that's to be expected

Sail on white moon
Across the dark and starry sky
Sail on white moon
Across the dark and starry sky

[Verse 1]
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh, oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?

[Verse 2]
Were you there when they pierced Him in the side?
Were you there when they pierced Him in the side?
Oh, oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they pierced Him in the side?

[Verse 3]
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Oh, oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
I was alone and sickly
It was a quarter of a moonlit night
I heard him cry through my window shade
And it filled me so full of fright
But I could not turn my back on him
I put on the back porch light
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan

I brought him bread and a blanket
But I told him "You can't come in"
You can sleep outside in the tool shed
Though a little rain comes in
Oh, I don't know you, you're a stranger
I don't know where you've been
"You can't come in here" said the keeper of the inn
"I don't want you in here," said the keeper of the inn

But I couldn't sleep for the thinking
You know my night got so insane
I thought, maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
But when I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
I thought maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning, Lord, he was gone
Frank:
I've got a home in that rock, don't you see?
I've got a home in that rock, don't you see?
The Charioteers:
Between the earth and sky I thought I heard my Savior cry
You better get home in that rock, don't you see?

Frank:
Now, the rich man Davies lived so well, don't you see?
Rich man Davies lived so well, don't you see?
The Charioteers:
Rich man Davies lived so well, when he died he had a home in hell
He had no home in that rock, don't you see

Frank:
A poor man Lazurus poor as I, don't you see?
Poor man Lazurus poor as I, don't you see?
The Charioteers:
Poor man Lazurus poor as I when he died he held my home on high
He had him a home in that rock, don't you see?
Frank:

You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?

Frank:

You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?
The Charioteers:
Between the earth and sky I thought I heard my Savior cry
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?
You better get a home in that rock, don't you see?
Some people are always Heaven made
Some people will live impermanent for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is better than tomorrow
Life is uncertain, let me hear you say, "Yeah"
That is that, oh yes, it is
There'll be days of sunshine and laughter
But don't forget you will have to shed some tears, oh
It's the law of the land, my brother, oh
Whether you like it or you'll understand, ah hey hey
It's the law of the land, hey hey, hey hey
'Cause made by almighty men
Live by the good book if you're able
You must play your cards on top of the table
When you gather, you either win or lose
In life's everybody's got to pay some dues, well
It's the law of the land, well well well
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand, you can't change it
It's the law of the land, ah how
'Cause made by almighty men, oh hey
Hey, it's the law, the law of the land
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand
It's the law, the law of the land
'Cause made by almighty men
A teacher man can't be found
Until you find yourself, think about it
You might not like being, well you ought, but you'd better start like it
But you sure can't be nobody else
In other words, I can't be you, ain't no quit, yeah
You can't be me, well well
That's all with you, my sister and brother
And that's the way that good life meant to be, hey ho
It's the law of the land, well
Whether you like it or you'll understand, say say
It's the law of the land, hey yeah oh
'Cause made by almighty men
Look at here
The tools of a man's day has got him by corrupt
For your own protection your Gods you must love
What goes around, comes around
And what goes up, yeah, must come down, aha
It's the law of the land, well well well well
Whether you like it or you'll understand
It's the law of the land, well well well
'Cause made by almighty men, aha
It's the law of the land, everybody else say
Whether you like it or you'll understand
Baby , oh no , i've been stuck here
I've been searchin' so long
Baby don't go , millions of people were wrong
In the dark of the cold light of day 
I will still be here
If my heart and my soul had their way 
You would still be here

Another lonely night in new york
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
'cause my baby's no longer around
And my feeling can never be found
Another lonely night in new york
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world

Baby , you said , a guy like me was way out of line
And knowing today , your leavin' was a question of time
In the mist of a sweet summer rain ,you will find me here
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way 
I'll be holdin' near
Another lonely night in new york
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
'cause my baby's no longer around
And my feelings can never be found
Another lonely night in new york
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world

(break)

In the dark of the cold light of day 
You will find me here
If my heart and my soul had their way 
You would still be here

Another lonely night in new york
And i'm just a soul in the heart of the city
Just another lonely night in new york
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
Just another lonely night in new york ( fade )
TV Girl- I don't care

(intro)
Everyone's talking 'bout the times ahead
As far as i'm concerned, were already dead
The funeral is over
The worlds gone mad
Everyone's concerned
But i'm happy as a clam

(chorus)
'cuz I don't care
(ohh oh)
I don't care
(ohh oh)
I don't care
(ohh oh)
I don't care
(ohh oh)

I smoke a pack of Reds and drink a six-pack everyday
I wanna stay sane and there ain't no better way
People call me crazy
They call me a cynic
So give me some advice and I'll tell you where to stick it
(chorus)
They say, read this, feel this, do this, do that
Eat right, exercise or you'll get fat
Get happy, get pissed, PCs and desist
Don't slit your wrist, its a blessing to exist
It's a lesson to be learned, penny saved penny earned
Have some kids, its your turn
Have a heart, do your part
Get smart, get informed
Protest the war

Play the hand your dealt
We're only trying to help
But i don't even listen, i hear it all the time
It all sounds the same, who will take the blame
I'll gladly be the villain if it gives you peace of mind
Call me a pathetic, but i don't really mind
She said love is a hard thing
Somewhere between golfing and gardening
Or parole board pardoning
But she was still down for a hard swing
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings
For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a bar-teend
And poor hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see why a bum had hard dreams
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene
Around the time they kicked us out, they had a park cleaned
She ain't living in a car she just RV-ing
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing
Known for burning clothes and petty car-keying
And other less harmful skylarking
Bought a bag out of American Rag
A small Chinese-made American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half
The picture that she bought wouldn't fit in the cab
On a train trying her best not to live in the past
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass
And that was it, fits, tantrums random
Helter-Skelter, a world gone Manson
And I'll spare you the details
Dinner is ceviche out of seashells
Annoyed cause her date really can't speak well
But she forced to press on like Lee nails
Next table was abhored by the weed smell
She was done at the moment that the tea fell
A thick wool jacket on a cool night
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight
Doesn't satisfy like a game of pool might
Thinking "what if Fantasia had a broom strike? "
Tune right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like?
She said "absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site"
And then left him
Like the Roots left Geffen
And the state Howlin' Wolf left Chess in
Stop to watch flows have an unpaid session on the steps of a Westin
She really need to check in
And to apologize to her best friend
New bras to put her chest in
Love life or deathin...
Biatch!

Eeeeh whappn no baby
You look good ina ya car eeh
Longtime mi watch ya mi whaa chat to ya
And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wha chat to me
So whappn Dre tell me whe di fuck a gwaan nuh!

Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my Glock clocked 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a tech 9 tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fuckin' heads cut off, muthafucker I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rollin' in my 4 with 16 switches
& got sounds for the bitches, clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by 'cause I'm too hard to lift
And no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the muthafuckin' D R E from the C P T
On a rhymin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top your trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop pop pop
Yeah 'cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse, go back & take another stop
'Cause I'm rollin' in my 6 4
With all the niggas sayin'
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah

Just another mothafuckin' day for Dre so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists it's just
That gangsta glare, with gangsta raps
That gangsta shit, that makes the gang of snaps, uh
Word to the muthafuckin' streets
And word to these hyped ass lyrics & dope beats that I
Hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my 4 on D's hittin' the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a muh'fucker ready to get my swerve on
But before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get The Chronic, the Remi Martin & my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches & skeezers
On my dick 'cause my 4 on hit
Pancake front & back, side to side & all that shit
So when I crawl I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip a nigga trip to the south side, yeah
Rollin' in my 6'4
With all the bitches sayin'
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the mothafuckin' bitches sayin'
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
You know what I'm sayin'?
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slausson
On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin'
Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 211
Fuck around & get caught up in a 187
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin' but I just watch them hang
So on & so on. Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak, now everybody
Peepin' out they windows when they hear me beatin' up the streets
"Is it Dre? Is it Dre?"
That's what they say, every single muthafuckin' day, yo
But I ain't trippin I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' & these hoes keep grinnin' I'll be
Rollin in my 6'4
With everybody sayin'
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With everybody sayin'
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Its 11:45
Gang of Escalades parked outside
Big bladess chromed up with shine
Only one thing on my mind
All week I've been a slave to the grind
Tonight I'm tryin' to have a good time
Rollin' wiht my whole crew behind me
To the livest hot spot we find

Haters step out my way
'Cause a playa just wanna play
No occasion to celebrate
But I'm gon' do it anywat
Line outside but I don't wait
Roll through the door but I don't pay
Lettin' go man I just can't wait
No more further delay
Time to get it on my people

(CHORUS)
Ain't a thang wrong with having a good time
Ain't a thang wrong eith getting it on tonight
Woo, woo, wwo fel alright
Leave the bullshit way behind
'Cause its party time
Making my way inside
See a honey by the bar that looks tight
Told her to order anything she likes
'Causeshe looks just that nice, yeah
After two drinks or more
I took her hand and moved to the floor
I handle mine, baby handle yours
'Cause I'm a make it hot for sure
Time to get it on my people

(CHORUS 2X)
(Rap)

(BRIDGE)
I wanna see you dancing on the floor
Hands in the air like you don't care no more
Because tonighr we're gon' all out fa sho
Nothin' else on my mind
You know it party time, party time
I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right
I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right
She go off every day and she won't come home 'till night
"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said
"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said
She don't care if I don't eat
'Cos she don't know how the rent is paid
She's a gamblin' woman, she chases men in between
She's a gamblin' girl, she chases men in between
She mistreats me and she cheats me
Meanest woman I ever seen
The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight
The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight
Every now and then I wonder will my baby be home tonight
I got a kind hearted woman
Sure is evil all the time
I got a kind hearted woman
Sure is evil all the time
Oh she wants to kill me
Just to have it all of mine

She's got a .32 special
Built on a cross of wood
She's got a .32 special
Built on a cross of wood
I got a .38/20
Man it's twice as good

Sometimes I'm thinking
You're too good to die
Sometimes I'm thinking
You're too good to die
Other times I'm thinking
You oughtta be buried alive
You tell me you're searching for a new place
You tell me tomorrow will have a true face
You say that I don't understand
When you speak of your summertime land
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along

You tell me your past often hurt you
And even your friends, they would desert you
But now you are beginning to see
The same things have happened to me
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along

You tell me your dreams have been broken
And not enough words have been spoken
The time has come to see it through
Slow down 'cause I'm coming with you
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love
Is playing the fool
Caring too much
Is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust
Is just for the children in school

I fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see
I fell in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out with me

I fell in love with love one night
When the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to see
I fell in love with love
With love everlasting
But love fell out
Yes, love fell out
Yes, love fell out
With me
Wendy, Wendy, what went wrong
Oh so wrong?
We went together for so long

I never thought a guy could cry
'Til you made it with another guy
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad

Wendy, Wendy, don't lose your head
Lose your head
Wendy ,don't believe a word he says

I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad

Wendy, I wouldn't hurt you like that
No no no
I thought we had our love down pat
Guess I was wrong
The farthest thing from my mind
Was the day that I'd wake up to find
My Wendy, Wendy left me alone

Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

The red man was pressed from this part of the west
It's not likely he'll ever return
To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
His flickering campfires still burn

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

How often at night when the heavens are bright
I see the light of those flickering stars
Have I laid there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of love
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

[Spoken Intro]
How can a non-musician discuss the future of music from anything other than a consumer point of view?
These few people make decisions for the bulk of us, without consulting any of us
Sales and distributions of our futures, uh!
If this world were fair and right, they'd give up the car keys this very night
Damn!
Hit it!
Two, three, four, five, six, seven

[Verse 1]
Flash forward, 2045
What did you stand for in the life of your pride
When faced with the final judgment of today
Who profitted from the game
That you and your niggas play
Radical man

[Verse 2]
Save the life
Come on take a stand
Give that money back

The brand new currency
Taking care of one another
You and me

Flash backwards, 1999
Backwards, 1999
In a world shot full of viruses, see
Tell me
How'd y'all stay alive?
Everyone of y'all
Depending on this so called man
For everything you got comes from his hand
Food, water, the clothes you wear
How many of y'all niggas really care?
To care
To care
Let's define this word, nigga
Define, define
Someone who stays high
High
Watching their life go by
By, by
Someone content with riding behind
Ride that
Nigga
They come in all colors
White, black, Puerto Rican
Is that the main niggas we're speakin' about?
Wear suits and buy and sell corporations
With only one thing in mind
Only one thing in mind
Break it up!
That is the destruction of the so-called radical man
By 2045
Let's get radical

[Verse 4]
Watch me now!
Schooled in the art of digital games
When the war broke out we called your name
(What's your name?)
Everyone of color put on the front line
Holocaust Avenue, 2009

[Verse 5]
Get an education, good job who says?
Say
Fool with the gold rush drinkin' Alize
I don't play nobody that's makin' no sense today
You got your own mind, so you think it's ok (It's not ok)
Telling themselves lies, Mos Def say
Where you gonna stay, nigga
Where you gonna stay nigga
Oh my God, it's the Green Mile!

[Spoken Interlude]
What's up y'all?
What y'all wanna do?
Talkin' about a radical man
Ain't nobody up in their crew no?
I could really run that computer
Make it flow
Flow flow flow flow flow
If you ain't born with it
Radical man
Talkin' about the two and four, hit me!
Wait up
What George say, all around
Alright

[Verse 6]
We claim Miles Davis, not Michaelangelo
We planted flags in the funk
You better act like you know
We don't care what Albert Einstein did
I'd rather know, rather know
What?
How to build a pyramid

[Verse 7]
Hey!
James Brown, Chuck D., and Jimi
Turn me up louder now
I don't think y'all hear me
I don't hear ya
2045
We will stay alive
2045
Yeah, everybody now
The war is on outside
And the whole pop scenario is just nothin' but a dream
A bad dream
The day you will wake is the day you get the real cream, nigga

[Breakdown]
Radical man
Radical man
Who got the gift, who got the plan?
Radical man
Radical man
Who got the gift, who got the plan?

[Verse 8]
This is the funk the industry most fears
Artists getting together
In a locker board of directors
I don't think so
Nobody's running this
Let's talk about DNA, nigga
The radical man

[Spoken Outro]
Where will you be in 2045?
30 million people right now, are being wiped off the face of the planet by disease
They claim they have no cure
In the matter of a blinking eye
All of us right now can testify
Take a stand, radical man

No matter how many hearts you have broken

Well I still love you baby
I'm waiting for your call

No matter how many times you have left me
Whoah and you said you never really cared
Oh I still love you
I'm just waiting for your call

Oh my dear my dear
The first time you left me
Whoah I couldn't say I did to make you stay
Oh But believe me dear
I'd never talk about about it
I'd just pray, pray that you'd come back home to me one day

Whoah No matter how long I'm longing outside
No matter how many times I been crying
Baby I still love you
And I'm just waiting
Baby I'm just waiting for your call
This road winds down through the valley
Through the warm green meadows I call home
Turn around and it leads across the mountains
Where the wind keeps telling me to roam

Down this road there's a fire always burning
There's a place at the table set for me
It's the same road that leads way over yonder
Where there's such a lot of world I'd like to see
There's so much of this old world I long to see

Tell my momma not to worry
I couldn't bear to know I made her cry
Tell my poppa if you see him
I tried, but I just couldn't say goodbye

I long to see the places they call somewhere
It's been my dream ever since my life began
And someday when my wandering days are over
I'll be coming back this road
You'll see me walking down the road
I'll be coming back this road
A better man

Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Well, if I done somebody wrong
Lord have mercy if You please

I used to have plenty money
Finest clothes in town
Bad luck and trouble overtook me
Why did You let me down?

Please have mercy Lord, have mercy if You please
Well, if I done somebody wrong
Have mercy if You please

Keep on working that child
Oh, in a mourning heart
Well, if I've been a bad boy, baby I'll change my way
Don't bad luck and trouble worry me

Oh, love my days
Please have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Well, if I done somebody wrong
Oh, have mercy if You please, oh Lord

[Chorus]
Here come them people, got me running, tryna they surround me
And out of nowhere in my head, I hear my mama talkin'
She told me quick money go send go send yo ass report to prison
And on some real Chicken Talk I think I should've listened
I'm Radric Davis but the ladies call me Gucci baby
I close my sometimes at night I hear my mama praying
I'm Radric Davis but the ladies call me Gucci baby
I close my sometimes at night I hear my mama praying

[Verse 1]
Real talk my first car was a Regal
Mama couldn't help me, so I bought the bitch myself
I cut my music up loud, the neighbors called 12
I'm just a young nigga gotta let the trunk wham
I took the hubcaps off and bought the gold rims
I'm 17 riding cleaner than your husband
There's nothing greater, bouncing, swerving, whippin thru Decatur
I blowed the brains out now, my high school homeboys turn to haters
Sophmore year Gucci fucking seniors
She's a doctor now, but Gucci fucked her by the bleachers
My mama told me son that one day boy you'll be a lawyer
I listened to her but I still went back on the corner

[Chorus]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear my crown of shit
On my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stain of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
Way down upon Sycamore Slough
A white man sings the blues
Selling roses of paper mache
With flecks of starlight dew
I swiped a bunch and threw it your way
Where hazy moonlight glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Shadowfall Ward
End of the avenue
Run, hide, seek in your own backyard
Mama's backyard won't do
All night long I sang Love's Sweet Song
Down where the water flowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Moonlight wails as hound dogs bay
But never quite catch the tune
Stars fall down in buckets like rain
Till there ain't no standing room
Bright blue boxcars train by train
Clatter where dreams unfold
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Seminole Square
Belly of the river tide
Call for me and I will be there
For the price of a taxi ride
Night double-clutches into today
Like a truck downshifting its load
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Thread the needle
Right through the eye
The thread that runs so true
All the others I let pass by
I only wanted you
Never cared for careless love
But how your bright eyes glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road

[Verse 1]
I don't care where you came from
Oh no, I don't care where you've been
All I know is that I love you
And I'm going to love you 'til the end
(Gonna love you until the end)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

[Verse 2]
For every hand there's a glove
For every, for every heart there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before

[Outro]
Yes, you're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
You're my (dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
(Better than anyone, better than anyone)
I love you (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before (Better than anyone before)
A-do me right because I love you (Better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before (Better than anyone before)
Baby (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before (Better than anyone before)
Oh (Better than anyone)
I really love you, baby (Better than anyone)
Do me right because I love you (Better than anyone)
I'm flying down deserted streets
Wrapped in mother's winding sheets
Asbestos boots on flaming feet
Dreaming of forbidden treats
When uniforms on nighttime beats
Ask me where I'm going and what I eat
I answer them with a voice so sweet

I can't come down
It's plain to see
I can't come down
I've been set free
Who you are and what you do
Don't make no difference to me

Well someone’s trying to tell me where it's at
How I do this and why I do that
With secret smiles, like a Cheshire Cat
And leather wings like a vampire bat
I fly away to my cold water flat
And eat my way to a bone of fat
And I say to the man with the funny hat
I can't come down
It's plain to see
I can't come down
I've been set free
Who you are and what you do
Don't make no difference to me

They say I've begun to lose my grip
My hold on reality is starting to slip
Tell me to get off this trip
They say that it's like a sinking ship
Life’s sweet wine's too warm to sip
And if I drink I'll surely flip
I just say as I take a nip

I can't come down
It's plain to see
I can't come down
I've been set free
Who you are and what you do
Don't make no difference to me

So, as I dream of cotton seas
And granite halls and redwood trees
An ugly eye that only sees
Endless mirrors and infinite me's
About the winter's coming freeze
This afterthought I say with ease
To all of you who made your pleas
I can't come down
It's plain to see
I can't come down
I've been set free
Who you are and what you do
Don't make no difference to me
Ah ah listen everybody (body), specially you girls (girls)
Is it right to be left alone when the one you love is never home
I love too hard my friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't fair

Can I get a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
Somebody (Can I get a witness)

Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Took to find it out all night I been cryin'
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by hr till the very end
Well she causes so much misery how's a gal supposed to be
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't right
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness
(Can I get a witness), I want a witness
(Can I get a witness), witness, witness
(Can I get a witness), witness, witness
(Can I get a witness)

Everybody knows especially you girls
That a love can be sad but my beloved's twice as bad
Now you kids do all agree that ain't the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
Yeah, I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
Somebody (Can I get a witness)

Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had
Keep on talking in my sleep 'cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you kids you all agree is that the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
Witness, witness, yeah, I want a witness

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
You played hooky from school
And you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said for the rest of the week
In your room you gotta stay, yeah
Now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you
(Now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you)
But deep down inside you know it ain't true

You've been punished 'cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care
'Cause you already made up your mind
You want to run away, yeah
You're on your way

[Chorus: The Temptations & (Dennis Edwards)]
Run away child, running wild
(Run away child, running wild)
Better come back home
(Better come back home)
Where you belong
(Where you belong)

[Verse 2: The Temptations]
Roaming through the city
Going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
Hey, it's getting late, where will you sleep
Gettin' kinda hungry
You forgot to bring something to eat
Oh, lost with no money, you start to cry
But remember you left home
Wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin' eyes

Siren screamin' down, neon light is flickin'
You want your mama
Ah, there's nothing for you
You're frightened and confused
I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see them no more
You want to hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go
Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mother's voice
'Cause you're lost and alone
But remember you make the choice, oh

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Runaway child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong, hey hey hey
Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong

[Bridge: Dennis Edwards & (The Temptations)]
You're lost in this great big city
(Go back home where you belong)
Not one familiar face, ain't it a pity?
(Go back home where you belong)
Oh, runaway child, running wild
You better go back home where you belong, oh yeah

[Outro: Dennis Edwards]
Mama, mama please come and see about me
Oh, but she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
I want my mama
Oh, you're frightened and confused
Which way will you choose?
I thought I knew the magic of you
And then you kissed me
Dear, when you kissed me
I simply stood there and gazed, completely amazed

I walked around, both feet on the ground
And then you kissed me
Dear, when you kissed me
I found myself on a cloud, apart from the crowd

I had nothing to glow about
You came by
Now I know all there's to know about
Things like stars in the sky

I will confess I thought for awhile
That you'd resist me
But then you kissed me
And now I'm in love

I will confess I thought for awhile
That you'd resist me
But then you kissed me
And now I'm in love
You kissed me
And now I'm in love
The old wolf sniffs the summer breeze, and dreams about his youth
For the sight of skirts above the knees turns his hardboiled brain to tears
And the scent of honey in the tree whets an old sweet tooth
The pretty girls go strolling by, I smile at them, and heave a sigh
And think of all the things I've missed, and all the pretty girls I've never kissed

They smile from field of daffodils, they wave from high and windy hills
In secret places by the sea, the girls I've never kissed still wait for me
All the girls whose names I can't recall, their faces haunt me still
All the pretty girls I've never kissed and never will
The girls of spring, the girls of fall, the girls of summer most of all
If only time did not exist, if only I could catch that boat I always missed
I'd go back and kiss all the pretty girls I've never kissed
Well the south side of Chicago
It's the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
He stood about six feet four
All the downtown ladies call him: "treetop lover"
The studs they call him: "Sir"

He's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he's a gambler
And he likes his fancy clothes
He likes to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose

He's got a custom Continental
He's got an Eldorado too
He's got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe
Yeah he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And he's meaner than a junkyard dog

Well Friday - 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar, sat a lady named Dorris
And man, she sure looked nice

Well he layed his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown he learned a lesson 'bout messin'
With the wife of a jealous man

Yeah he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

He's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
A badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Yeah, he's bad old King Kong
Badder than a junkyard dog
(feat. Common)

[Girl:] Do I look fat to you?

[Jamie:] Baby you know I love you

[Girl:] That's not what I asked you

[Common:] Uh, Uh, Uh

[Verse One:]
Girl I know your going crazy, let me help you understand
That you're about to have my baby, and we about to be a fam
Don't you know that when we got married, we'd be true through thick and thin?
Well I know you're lookin thick now, but I'm witcha to the end
U still got it...

[Chorus:]
U still got it gurl e'ry day, e'ry night you know you rock my world
(Don't you know that you still got it?)
And your emotions flowin' cause you know that your body's growin
(Don't you know that you still got it)
That new jersey's snug, well I ain't mad at that baby, it's just more to love
(U still got it)
Oh baby, your love's crazy, cause you havin my baby
(And there's so much more to love)

[Verse Two:]
See you walkin through the mall now, see them outfits that you like
Oh but you scared to try them on now, cause they just won't fit you right
And you stedy watchin Oprah, tryin to redefine your life
But as long as your my lady, I don't care about your size

[Bridge:]
Your hair, (your hair I know) I know your feet are swelling
No need to cry I dig them thighs, that's why I'm telling you
U still got it...

[Chorus:]
U still got it gurl e'ry day, e'ry night you know you rock my world

(U still got it)
Oh baby, your love's crazy, cause you havin my baby
(And there's so much more to love)

[Common:]
Take a look at my lady, and my day began to shine
Told her, "Baby being beautiful is a state of mind, and you are."
So, had to let your mind and your heart know, as you grow, the more, the more I see God glow
I know it's probably strange, seeing your body change
Can't fit your clothes, nose ain't the same
But love still remains, it won't vary with me
Look at you and smile, thinkin' Damn she carry a me!
A life we created, we can cherish forever
You growin, but it's sexy, the sex is even better
But through thick and thin, pickles and peanut butter, is a divine mother, queen and supreme lover
U still got it
I know that you still got it
Don't you know that you still got it?
U still got it
You surely must know magic girl
'Cause you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl
And you're all that matters to me
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see girl
Just knowin' your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin' in on me girl
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl
And you're all that matters to me
Baby, you're part of every thought I think each day
Your name is in every phrase, my lips say
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey, I can't live without you
Baby
(Baby)
Baby
(Baby)
Baby
You're my everything, you're my everything
(Yes you are, you're my everything girl)
You're the girl I sing about in every love song I sing
(You're my everything)
You're my winter baby, my summer, my fall and spring
(You're my everything)
Now, now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl
And you're all that matters to me
You're my everything, you're my everything

Di di di di di la la la la la la
In a spaceship over the mountains
Chasing rainbows in the setting sun
Leaving heart and home for the city of angels
I feel my life is undone

There are pathways winding below me
In pleasure I've gone where they go
In the quiet stillness I can hear symphonies
The loveliest music I know

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again

Oh, it's been a long time since I've listened
Still longer since I've walked with you
For the first time I know what I'm missing
Some answers are no longer true
So I question the course that I follow
I'm doubtful and deep in despair
My heart is filled with impossible notions
Can it be you no longer care?

Still, I ride on the wings of a high wind
Blowing steady and strong behind me
As the clouds surrender my fate is for certain
I'm a sailor who runs to the sea

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again

[Verse 1]
Once in a while, in a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist invented this
4th of July night ride home

[Verse 2]
Hula girls and caterpillar
Tractors in the sand
The ukulele man, the fireworks
This 4th of July night ride home

[Chorus]
I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the overkill, far from the overload

[Verse 3]
Back at the bar, the band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines gleam
On this 4th of July night ride home

[Verse 4]
Round the curve and a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside, rev for stride
4th of July night ride home

[Chorus]
I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the undertow, far from the overload

[Outro]
Once in awhile, in a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist invented this
4th of July night ride home

You say you saw the dark side
Baby I know
It Gets you through the night
And love is like a red rose baby and so
It's coming around again
If we can take the same direction we'll find
The road that never ends
But love never dies
It goes on forever love never dies
Love never dies it goes on forever

This is the love you've been talking about
You led her in till she couldn't get out
You made the little girl cry
No sad stories to deny

I go through holy war for you baby you know
You say you ain't got a prayer
I'll answer if you call for me
Baby I'm yours
To God above I swear
I only wanna live in the shadow you make
The soul never lies
But love never dies it goes on forever
Love never dies, love never dies
It goes on forever
You better run to the heart of the flame
She don't change like the sun in the rain
She don't understand why
You made the little girl cry

Love never dies, it goes on forever love never dies
Love never dies it goes on forever

This is the love you've been talking about
You led her in till she couldn't get out
You made the little girl cry
No sad stories to deny
You better run to the heart of the flame
She don't change like the sun in the rain
She don't understand why
You made the little girl cry

I can't exist, I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way

[Chorus]
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you (Desire for you)
So come on down and do what you've got to do

(Please don't leave me)
Ooh baby
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine 'round my back door someday

I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna take me a rocking chair
And if the blues don't leave, I rock on away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let that 2:19 special ease my troubled mind
Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Oh...oh...hey hey
Come on, come on...

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
I know you've heard this line a thousand times
The way you look tonight just blow my mind
Let's go some place for we could talk a while
'Cause I don't wanna lose this vibe
Don't wanna push you, but where are your friends? Yeah
And I'll make sure that you get home when the party ends
Is there some place special you would like to go?
Just as long as you don't say no

[Chorus]
Don't wanna waste your time (I don't wanna waste your time)
Sit back and relax your mind (relax your mind)
I wanna be what you need and more
Just tell me what you like (what you like, what you like)

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Girl, are you hungry? Let me cook for you
My place is near, just right up Park Avenue
I know a place that's not too far away
Fly first class New York to LA
Listen, I know you're feeling me
I'm feeling you
So let's thank this now before we try to make this move
I won't say words I don't really mean
'Cause I want you to stay with me

[Chorus]
Don't wanna waste your time (don't wanna)
Sit back and relax your mind (sit back and relax your mind)
I wanna be what you need and more (what you need)
Just tell me what you like (tell me, tell me what you like, baby)
Don't wanna waste your time (I don't wanna)
Sit back and relax your mind (tell me what you want from me)
I wanna be what you need and more (and you know I'll give it to you)
Just tell me what you like (tell me what you like)

[Bridge: Faith Evans]
I like it, I like it, I really really like it
I'm for it, adore it, Boyz II Men, you got me open
I like it, I like it, I really really like it
I'm for it, adore it, Boyz II Men, you got me open
And you got me

[Chorus]
Don't wanna waste your time (And I don't wanna waste)
Sit back and relax your mind (sit back and relax your mind)
(Just relax your mind)
I wanna be what you need and more ('Cause I wanna I wanna be)
Just tell me what you like
Don't wanna waste your time (don't wanna waste, no)
Sit back and relax your mind (you sit back and relax your mind)
(Just relax your mind)
I wanna be what you need and more
Just tell me what you like (Ohh yeah)
Just tell me what you like...
I drank sixteen doubles for the price of one
Trying to find the courage to talk to one
I asked her for a dance
Not a second glance
My night had just begun

Well I drink to the father and the holy ghost
I'm kneeling at the alter of my nightly post
So I'll raise a glass, not the first nor last
Come join me in this toast

(Chorus:)
Because the old black rum's got a hold on me
Like a dog wrapped round my leg
And the old black rum's got a hold on me
Will I live for another day?
Hey, Will I live for another day?

Well the queen of George street just went walking on by
Walking on by with some guy who don't care
That she stood in line
Since half past nine
And spent three hours on her hair (On her hair!)
Well her friend is looking at me with an evil grin
I think the bloody racket might soon begin
I must have said some thing
To the George street queen
The boys are joining in!

(Chorus:)
So I drank all of my money
And I slept out in the rain
Everyday is different but the nights they're all the same
You never see the sun on the old black rum
But I know I'm gonna do it again!

(Chorus:) 2x
Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam

She come up the Canadian Rockies where the crystal waters glide
Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide
From the great Pacific Ocean to where the sun sets in the west
That big Grand Coulee country in that land I love the best

In the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave
Once she tore men's boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
That day that Grand Coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream

Oh, Uncle Sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three
For the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me
He said: roll it on Columbia, you can roll out to the sea
But river, while you're rolling you can do some work for me

Now from Washington and Oregon you can hear them factories a-hum
Making corn and making manganese and light aluminum
Always a flying fortress to blast for Uncle Sam
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee dam
Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam

[Intro]
Listen, listen!
Here we go downtown
Oh boy, oh (garbled) ... all around
You can't stop (garbled)
Ka-blamo!

[Chorus]
You just won the lottery, that's ka-blamo!
You kissed Shannon Doherty, that's ka-blamo!
You joined a sorority, that's ka-blamo!
You lied about the lottery, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 1]
You met Fred Segal at a debutante's ball
You gave him your number, he gave you a call
He told you to meet him at the corner at eight
You met him at nine, that's right, you were late
You stupid idiot, you don't know what you missed
Fred Segal's a star, and you cold dissed
His pimping-ass cooling-ass Mack-ass building
With diggity ivy on the wall but not around the lettering
You dissed Fred Segal, and everybody knows
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) You're not ka-blamo

[Chorus]
The doc fixed your arteries, that's ka-blamo!
Your mouthwash is gargly, that's ka-blamo!
Your water is watery, that's ka-blamo!
I majored in pottery, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 2]
You're chilling with your dudes and then they stab you in the face
On the way to the hospital you're bleeding all over the place
Your leg is amputated 'cause you got gangrene
And then you get cancer and you die in your teens
But then this really pretty girl who you always really liked
Shows up to your funeral and that's a real mixed blessing

[Chorus]
Your jello is wobbly, that's ka-blamo!
You met Gilbert God-fer-y, that's ka-blamo!
You're Harlem Globetrotter-y, that's ka-blamo!
You watch the disorderlies, not ka-blamo!

[Verse 3]
When you're mining for coal and you forget what coal is
And you're sure to be fired, because that's your job!
When a mole's in your ass and you wonder where the mole is
You're screwed man, a mole is in your ass. Job!
The meaning of life is revealed to you
And all of the drinks are old English brew
Your whim is the word of the people on earth
But the whole "mole in the ass" thing is haunting you. Earth!

[Chorus]
When your fluids are bodily, that's ka-blammy
What happened to ka-blamo? I mean ka-blamo!
Good, that's better, that's ka-blammy!
Wait, I'm confused, we said ka-blamo!

[Outro]
Hard
My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for furs and laces
My baby don't care for high toned places
My baby don't care for rings
Or other expensive things
She's sensible as can be
My baby don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for me

DJ Easy Dick will give you a Stone Cold Groove
Lets all go to Doggy Land huh
Bing! Bang! Pop! Pow!
Jesus what am I going to do now?
I think my engine's about to explode
I need to pull over to the side of the road

My car is smokin' and I'm losin' my vision
Hope I don't get to a traffic collision
Callin' on Jesus the Great Jehova
Qualified traffic trying to get over

I thought to myself "Oh my God!
That sounds like my engine rod!"
Man, I'm so stuck, got no luck
Got to walk ten miles just to call a tow truck

Spent three hours and the pump can't find me
Highway patrol pulling up behind me
"Is this your car?" "Yes sir." "Well prove it
By the way three hours to move it
If you're still here when I come back round
You'll be heading downtown to the edam."
Back on the bus, can I get a transfer?
Car broke down...(car broke down)
Just got a job, I just got hired
Way across town

My car got towed by prejudice cops
I know tomorrow morning I'll be at the bus stop
I told my girl the bad news at the bar
She said "Oh baby, you can use my car."

So I comin' to her house for the rest of the night
And I my get a little thing all right
She gave me the keys, the very next day
I pulled on my clothes and jumped the freeway

I turned on the radio, the bass was rockin'
All of a sudden man, I hear some knockin'
I though to myself "Oh my God!
That sounds like her engine rod!"

It must be curse, this is crazy bro
Cause I broke two cars two days in a row
A cop gave me a ride to the payphone
They call a tow truck, it get away home
My girl's going to curse and my girl's going to fuss
Nobody got car we go for the bus
Back on the bus, can I get a transfer?
Car broke down...(car broke down)
Just got a job, I just got hired
Way across town

Waiting at the bus stop me and my girl
Trying to move up in the material world
There's no sequel, I feel equal
To the dog fleas and the homeless people

I told Jesus I need an answer
Told the bus driver I need a transfer
Lookin' for a seat, I thought about money
I took a deep breath and then I smelled some thing funny

One man smelled like a alcoholic
Another smelled like a pot of old tonic
I stood in the back in a school shirt
Cause all them seats smell just like urine

Nobody on the bus makes good money
So why's this high school kid makin' fun of me?
I rung the bell, the bus passed my stop
Man I had to walk back about four or five blocks

Maybe my life would be this hard
If I started putting aside time for God
When I start trying, when I start praying
Bad thing start happening, you know what I'm sayin?'
Back on the bus, can I get a transfer?
Car broke down...(car broke down)
Just got a job, I just got hired
Way across town

Hope I don't panic when I talk to the mechanic...
Spoken:
Once upon a time in the land of hushabye
In the woundrous days of yore
They came upon this kind of box
All bound with chains and locked with locks
And labelled "kindly do not touch, it's WAR"

Decree was issued round about
All with a flourish and a shout
And gayley colored mascots trippling lightly on the fore
"do not tamper with this deadly box"
"Don"t break the chains or pick the locks"
"Please don't ever play about with war"

Well the children understood
Children happen to be good
And they were just as around the time of yore
They didn't try to break the chains or pick the locks
They didn't play about with war

Mommies didn't either
Sisters aunts grannies neither
They were quiet and sweet and pretty in those wondrous days of yore
Fairley much the same as now
Not the ones to blame somehow
For opning up that deadly box of war
But someone did
Someone battered in the lid
And spilled the insides out across the floor
A sort of bouncy bumpy ball, made up of guns and flags and all the tears and
Horror and death, that goes with war

It bounced right out and went bashing all about
And bumping into everything in store
And what was sad and most unfair
Is that it didn't really seem to care much who it bumped
Or why, or what, or for

It bumped the children mainly
And I'll tell you this quite plainly
It bumps them evry day and more, and more
And leaves them dead and burned and dying
Thousands of them sick and crying
Cause when it bumps
Its really very sore

Now there's a way to stop the ball
It isn't difficult at all
All it takes is wisdom
And I'm absolutely sure that
We could get it back in the box
And bind the chains
And lock the locks
No one seems to want to save the children any more
Well thats the way it all appears
Cause its been bouncing round for years and years
In spite of all the wisdom whiz since those wondrous days of yore
When they came upon this kind of box
All bound up with chains and locked up with locks
And labelled "Kindly do not touch"
"ITS WAR"
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Can help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way
With toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
(Merry Christmas to you)

[Verse 1]
If you see me walkin' down the street one day
Don't say nothin' to me
No no, nothin'
'Cause you did me wrong when I was doing bad
So bad, I didn't think I was gonna make it
Now I'm alone, feelin' free
Freer than the butterfly flyin' high now, yeah yeah, baby
I don't claim no riches or any miracles
But I'm doin' better on my own

[Chorus]
So if you see me, walk on by, baby
Don't say nothin', walk on by now
Do yourself a favor, walk on by, yeah
Don't say nothin', walk on by, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You didn't even try to understand
Just where I was comin' from, no no, baby
Instead of understanding, you gave me your demandings
And I couldn't stand it, uh-uh, baby
Now it's much to late and there's no time for me to try
Not anymore, uh-uh, baby
Listen; say, I don't feel no pain, it doesn't hurt inside
And I'm doin' better on my own

[Chorus]
So if you see me, walk on by, baby
Don't say nothin', walk on by now
Do yourself a favor, walk on by, baby
Don't say nothin', walk on by, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now it's much too late and there's no time for me to try
Not anymore, uh-uh, baby
I don't feel no pain, it doesn't hurt inside
And I'm doin' better on my own

[Chorus]
So looka here, baby
If you see me: walk on by now
Don't say nothin', walk on by now
Just do yourself a favor, yeah, walk on by girl
Don't say nothin', walk on by, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Looka here, don't, don't, don't try to talk to me now, baby
I'm doin' okay
I'm makin' it on my own, baby
Looka here
Do yourself a favor
You know, honey, you know I ain't rich or nothin'
I ain't claimin' no miracles, but, ah
Do yourself a favor
I'm a bachelor now, baby
You know what I'm sayin'?
Do yourself a favor
Just do yourself a favor, baby, just walk on down the street, huh
Do yourself a favor
I ain't got a damn thing to say to you now, baby, look out!
Do yourself a favor
When we was together, did you try to understand me? No
Do yourself a favor
So just do yourself a favor and get the hell down the road
Do yourself a favor
Mmh
Do yourself a favor
Too sexy
Yes, mmh
Somebody call up the Colonel, I hear some chicken scratchin'
Good God, yes
Too sexy
Somebody else fall in, I don't care who it is
Just come on, keep it goin', come on
Uh, yes
You like that?
Then come here, sit down
Let me talk to you
You hear that?
That's a fifty dollar bill
When's the last time you seen one of them?
That's what I thought
Let me tell you somethin'
When me and you used to be, me and you used to be together
I didn't have no money in my pocket
That's all different now, that's all different
Now you wanna play, now you wanna play crazy
You're not crazy
You're no crazier than I, don't play, don't act like that
You didn't try to understand where I was comin' from back then
Why you tryin' to now?
'Cause you know I got that money, that's why
Uh huh, yeah
Sit down, don't talk, come here, sit down!
I'll kick your ass
What, you think you bad now?
I'll kick your ass
Come here, good God
Mmh
Oh yes
Somebody call up the Colonel, I hear some chicken scratchin'
Pow
If you see me walkin' down the street one day, baby
Don't say nothin'
You used to do me wrong, baby
That's back when I was doin' bad
But now, baby, now, baby, I got more money than I ever had
Oh Lord, yes yes
Do yourself a favor, baby
Take it on down the road
Let that sidewalk hit you where the dog should've bit you, yes baby
Oh Lord
Oh Lord, eh
I'll kick your ass
Don't you play crazy with me, I'm
You, you not crazy, I'm crazy
I'm the one that's crazy
You're not crazy
Come here
Don't you walk away from me
I don't care what I told you, come back here
You hear me talkin' to you, baby?
Come here, come here
I'll kick your ass
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
With sweet love and devotion gently touching my emotion

I want to stop - to thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

Open my eyes at night
I wonder what I would be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I've done you know I've done them before
But you brightened up all of my days
With your love so sweet and in so may ways

I want to stop - to thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Sweeter than the honey from the bees, baby
If only I could be less blind
If only I knew what to find
Everywhere and all of the time
It's bending my mind

Confusion's prince is at my door
The crown I wear is the one he wore
He's here to bring me down some more
And bend my mind

The friendly stranger calls my name
He only wants me for his game
But it don't matter, just the same
I'll bend his mind

I've waved my flags into the sun
I've fought my wars and now they're won
And I didn't need nobody's gun
I bent their mind

If only I could be less blind
If only I knew what to find
Everywhere and all of the time
It's bending my mind

When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
I always wanted to be on the fucking radio
But they wouldn't play me though
Whack ass corporate world dj
Only play what the pencil neck geeks say play
I stopped making songs for them
I started making songs for me
Whats wrond with me
I sold it on the street, they love my beat
Homemade talent packed with heat
Somebody put me on napster
Next thing you know, im on the radio, in San Diego
Howard stern gave me a spin
If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story, I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife, she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door

Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill

'Twas in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:

You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home

[Verse 1:]
Girl here we are, in this big ol empty room*
Staring at ya, who's gonna make the first move
Been doing our thing for a minute
But now that our hearts are in it
The only place to go, is all the way (ah, hmm)

[Break:]
Is that alrgiht (alright)
Is that okay (okay)
You don't need to be nervous (no baby)
Cause I, got, you, all, night
Don't you worry bout a thing babe, just

[Chorus:]
Just Go with it, go with it, go with it (I will go real)
Slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it (I will go real)
Slow with it, slow with it
It's my first time on you, baby
And I wanna make it right for you
(It's our first time)

[Verse 2:]
Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooo girl you're my desire, your wish is my demand
Treat you like a princess, oh girl you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a summer day gonna eat you
Before you melt away

[break]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
We can go slow (we can go slow)
We can go fast (we can go fast)
All you gotta do is ask me girl (ask me girl)
The candles are burning (candles are burning)
Our bodies are yearning (bodies are yearning)
I can't wait to love you
I'm so ready baby, I'm so ready baby

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

[Verse 1]
My life's a masquerade
A world of let's pretend, dear
Since you took your love
Pretending never ends, dear
But I can't let you know
That I still need you so, no

[Chorus]
(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

[Verse 2]
I can't let you see
All the tears I'm crying
You would pity me
That would be like dying
If I can't have your love
I don't need your sympathy

[Chorus]
(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

[Bridge]
My life is a masquerade
Since you took your love away

[Chorus]
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
I just can't let you see
How much you hurting me
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
(John Jarvis, Eric Kaz)

I know you've run out of time for a fool like me
It's all over now, you can't disguise
All these constant good-byes
I can't see, but I close my eyes and I walk away
And try not to hear the words you say
But I can't seem to turn my heart away
There's a feeling out tonight, you're beside me everywhere
Anyone would say, "It's over," but I just don't seem to care
'Cause I could never turn my heart away
I just can't seem to turn my heart away
I can hear the music play, well I'm the only one who knows
Maybe I'm a fool for listenin', but it takes me where it goes
'Cause I can never turn my heart away
I just can't seem to turn my heart away
Something inside me needs to know
I can live to love again
What is now has always been
I need to let you know
But I just can't turn away, and I can't stop loving you
I can feel the end is near, but I can't admit it's true
'Cause I could never turn my heart away
I just can't seem to turn my heart away
You go…I'll stay
'Cause I just can't seem to turn my heart away

[Verse 1]
So here's to you, may your dreams come true
May old Father Time never be unkind
And through the years, save your smiles and your tears
They're just souvenirs, they'll make music in your heart

[Chorus]
Remember this, each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above with an angel's love
So here's to you, may your skies be blue
And your love blessed, that's my best to you

[Chorus]
Remember this, each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above with an angel's love
So here's to you, may your skies be blue
And your love blessed, that's my best to you
I find myself thinking about what you do
Though I know I’m better off without you
I never break down any longer
I don’t know why I can’t move on
I really need, I really want you to

Refrein:
Bring me down!
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, bring me down

I’m looking back, I see I wasn’t happy
To do, do it again, yeah that would be crazy
It’s so uncommon quiet without you
Got to admit that I long for you
I really need, I really want you to

Refrein
Bring me down!
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, Yeah
You’re the river I’ll be drowning in some day
I take my chances anyway

Refrein 3x
Bring me down
Yeah I miss that mess you make
Come around for old times sake
I need a sweet taste of bitter, bring me down
Ooh, love was true yesterday
I love you ev'ry way
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
And then I knew, I had to have you

You could be mine if you tried
All that you do is tell me lies
You think that love's a game
But I don't feel the same
I should have known that I'll get the pain

Ooh, love was true yesterday
I love you ev'ry way
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
And then knew I had to have you
Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrill be gone?
Tomorrow night, will this be just another memory?
Or just another lovely song that's in my heart to linger on?
Tonight, your lips are tender, your heart, your heart is beating fast
And you're willing, willingly surrender, oh, tell me darling, will it last?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
And will you say those lovely things you said tonight?

Tonight, your lips are tender, your heart, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly, willingly surrender, oh, tell me darling, will it last? Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
And will you say all the lovely things you said tonight?

[Verse 1]
Now, when I leave this town
Won't be back no more
Yes, when I leave this town, mama
Won't be back no more
I've got the blues so bad
Standing 'round my door

[Verse 2]
Yes, I got the blues so bad
Why won't you let me be
I have the blues so bad, mama
Why won't you let me be?
Now when I go to Chicago
Blues, don't you follow me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm asking mama, mama
Please don't cry no tears
Yes, I say, mama, mama
Please don't cry no tears
Because I'll always love you
Through all my days and years
Well, I can't get along no matter what I do
Well, we can't get along no matter what I do
Yes, everything I do is wrong
No matter what I do

Well, let's make it up baby, try it just one more time
Well, let's make it up baby, try it just one more time
Well, if we don't get together baby
Won't be no fault of mine

Lay it down
Alright then

Well, it's been a long time baby, but it's all over now
Oh, it's been a long time baby, but it's all over now
We can't get together, baby
You were no good no how
Anytime
Anytime
Anytime

Anytime you need me, babe, just call, I'll be there
Call and see what a good friend can be
When you need someone to care
Nothing more than understanding
Just a man who's undemanding
Like a leaf that's only landing
Suddenly goes when the wind gently blows
And I'm asking nothing of you, love
Only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself
As long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you
Just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
It's not out of greed but for love and for need

I love you so, I still do
I'm sure you know when I'm holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye
Call and I'll come when your world's come undone
I'm like you, I get lonely too
And I need someone to hold (Just like you)
Knowing well this world can be hell
And sometimes very cold

Nothing firm and nothing binding
Now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone

Oh, babe (Anytime)
I'll be there (Anytime)
I'll be there (Anytime)
Anytime

There's a certain thing about you
Summer, fall and spring about you
I could write and sing about you
And never run out, never run out, no
Never run out of what you're all about

Oh, babe (Anytime)
I'll be there (Anytime)
I'll be there (Anytime)
Anytime
There's a certain thing about you
Summer, fall and spring about you
I could write and sing about you
And never run out, no, never run out

[Verse 1]
Stuck here, in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Oh well nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play my part

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
That help is just around the corner for us

[Verse 2]
Oh my head just won't stop achin'
And I'm sat here lickin' my wounds
And I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
Cos my rescue is gonna be here soon

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
Help is just around the corner for us
That help is just around the corner for us
Oh that help is just around the corner for us
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh, to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're givin' back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon

Now you say you're leavin' home
'Cause you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leaving there too soon
You're leaving there too soon
We have nothing to remember so far, so far
So far we haven't walked by night and shared the light of a star
So far your heart has never fluttered so near, so near
That my own heart alone could hear it
We haven't gone beyond the very beginning
We've just begun to know how lucky we are
So we have nothing to remember so far, so far
But now I'm face to face with you and now at last we've met
And now we can look forward to the things we'll never forget

We haven't gone beyond the very beginning
We've just begun to know how lucky we are
So we have nothing to remember so far, so far
But now I'm face to face with you, and now at last we've met
And now we can look forward to the things we'll never forget

No keepsakes have we for days that are gone
No fond recollections to look back upon
No song that we love, no scene to recall, we have no traditions at all
Thou swell, thou witty, thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, I choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee
I'd feel so rich in a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand

[Verse 1]
If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the wind hits heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

[Verse 2]
If you go where the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and the summer ends
Please see for me she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

[Verse 3]
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
That's the way I remember her best

[Verse 4]
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

[Verse 1]
If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the wind hits heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
All across this new divide

In every loss
In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret
And each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide
All across this new divide
All across this new divide

[Verse 1]
You build me up
You knock me down
Provoke a smile
And make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true

[Verse 2]
You chew me up
And spit me out
Enjoy the taste
I leave in your mouth
You look at me
I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Verse 3]
Immobilized by the thought of you
Paralyzed by the sight of you
Hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe them anyway

[Verse 4]
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There may not
Be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'till I'm under your skin
All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
Hey, I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby
One that ain't never been told

I went to work the other day
But I thought that I would double back
And that car I saw sitting in front of my door
Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac, yeah!

I ain't got none now baby
I think you've been cheating on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need

The iceman came by this morning
And you know he didn't leave no ice
The postman came by later baby
And he didn't even ring twice

I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need
Now, I want you to tell the iceman
The next time he'd better leave some ice
And I want you to tell the postman
He'd better ring more than twice

And when I come home from work in the morning
Better still be some groceries on the shelf
I want to tell that slick insurance man
That he'd better write some insurance on his self

Yes, I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some help, some help
Some help, I don't really need
Oh yeah, alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams, tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end the love you take
Is equal to the love you make
Pretty little thing
She held all the magic that's so hard to believe
Never too far away
It's hard to conceive

Never thought she'd have to go
Never thought she'd leave
It came like a killer blow
Killer blow

Funny, isn't it?
That a little girl can make the world seem so small
Hard to believe
The little girl can seem so tall

And the thing that he calls love
Isn't thick enough?
She had to go
That's the way it goes
Killer blow
Your love has wings
That took her to the things he couldn't give
She got the kiss of life
Kiss of life

She's gone where it's so easy to live
It's so easy to live
Searching for the scent of content
Oh no, it's the killer blow
Killer blow

Get along without me, boy
Get along without me
You see things aren't quite what they seem
Get along without me, why me?
Out of your dreams
I'm no angel, I'm no
This may come
As a killer blow
Killer blow
Killer blow
Train I ride 16 coaches long
Train I ride 16 coaches long
Well that big black train
Took my baby along

Train, train movin' round the bend
Train, train movin' round the bend, round the bend
Well he took my baby
But he never will again

[Intro]
Hold it, everybody
Hold it, hold it, listen

[Verse 1]
I can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land

[Chorus]
But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you (I can't get next to you, babe)
Next to you (I can't get next to you)
I just can't get next you (I can't get next to you, babe)
(I can't get next to you)

[Verse 2]
I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

[Chorus]
Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you (I can't get next to you, babe)
No matter what I do (I can't get next to you)
Uh-yah

[Bridge 1]
Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom, chicka boom
Chicka boom, boom, boom

[Verse 3]
I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh, I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do

[Bridge 2]
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause, girl, you're the key to my happiness
And I, oh I can't get next to you

[Chorus]
Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need
I gotta get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get, now (next to you)
Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get..

[x2]
Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me in times of bad
When the day comes and you're in doubt
In a river of trouble about to drown
Hold on, hold on
I'm coming, I'm coming
Hold On, hold on
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm on my way your lover
When you get cold, I'll be your cover
Don't have to worry because I'm here
Don't need to suffer because I'm here
Hold on, hold on
I'm coming, I'm coming
Hold on, hold on
I'm coming, I'm coming
Reach out to me for satisfaction
Call my name, quick reaction
Hey, hey, hey
Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me in times of bad
When the day comes and you're in doubt
In a river of trouble about to drown
Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me in times of bad
Hold on, hold on
I'm coming, I'm coming

[Intro (spoken)]
Hello? Yo, I'm in the booth
I'ma call you right back
Nah, I just gotta put this one part down
I'ma call you back
I'm at the studio, man, what?
Man, quit playin' with me, man
No, for real, don't play like that
Are you, are you serious?
How you know?
Put that on everything
Damn...
I'ma call you back
I'ma call you back

[Verse]
Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
(No!) I was out doin' my dirt
(Oh!) Wasn't thinkin' about you gettin' hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center, like, man
Not givin' a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (Just listen)
Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home
Thinkin' about me
Bein' a good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be the worse if you heard this from somebody else
(Oh no)

[Outro]
I know you hate me
I know I hurt you
But there's more
Listen...
People Got Money
Still Got problems
Got to the doctor
And try to solve them
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues

Baby needs new shoes
Mama needs a new dress
Daddy's out scufflin'
Tryin' to do his best
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues

Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
You party on a Saturday
Go to church on Sunday
Fun leaves you because
Gotta work on Monday
Anyway you look at it

It's still called the blues

Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again

Ain't got no money
To pay the rent
Baby's gone
You spent your last cent
Mm, still called the blues
Still called the blues, y'all

Anyway you look at it
Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now

There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now

What , what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
How can i win
Where will i be tomorrow
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now

What , what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
How can i win
Where will i be tomorrow

Was there a moment when i cut you down
Played around
What have i done
I only apologize
For being as they say , the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes

What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
Wondering why
Where will i be tomorrow
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
How can i win
Where will i be tomorrow (fade)
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet

But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh, wee
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way, play it strange

Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth

But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh, wee
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

[Instrumental 0:00 - 1:21]

[Verse 1]
The Sun has left the sky
Now you can close your eyes
Leave all the world behind until tomorrow

[Verse 2]
The dream is like a song
It leads you on and on
The piper plays his tune, so you must follow

[Instrumental 1:48 - 2:38]

[Verse 3]
So far beyond the sky
Not knowing how or why
You realize the feeling is forever

[Verse 4]
And though another day
May steal your dreams away
You and the song will always stay together

[Instrumental 3:06 - 7:12]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Tonight, Enoch Powell said, “Get out immigrants
Immigrants a-better go home”
Hah, hah, hah, hah
Tonight, Harold Wilson said to the immigrants
“You better get back to your Commonwealth homes”
Yeah, yeah, yeah
He said, “Ya better get back home”

Enoch Powell

We’re going up to Europe and

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Oh, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Yeah, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Oh, hear me talking
Commonwealth
Yeah, that Commonwealth
But it’s much too wealthy for me (Much too common for me)
It's much too common for me, oh yeah

[Verse 6: Paul McCartney]
I ambled to Australia and New Zealand, too
I went up to Pakistan and India, too
I came back to West Indies
And I had a cricket match
I went into South Africa
And told them to get back
Oh, Commonwealth
I said, "You’re much too common for me"

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Everybody sing
Hey, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Yeah, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Enoch Powell, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Immigrants, Commonwealth (Yes?!)
Well, I would join the Common Market
But it’s much too common for me (Yes!)
You better run just as fast as you can
I've got no reason to try
You did it to me and I'm taking a stand
You've got a reason to cry

Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me

Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid (all right)
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me

Spent my life making my love to you
I've got no reason to try
Got no reason left for making you blue
You've got a reason to cry

Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me
You better run just as fast as you can
You better run just as fast as you can..
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be
Let our hearts discover

I have a feeling
It's a feeling
I'm concealing
I don't know why
It's just a mental
Incindental, sentimental alibi

But I adore you
So strong for you
Why go on stalling
I'm falling
Love is calling
Why be shy

....

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it

Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it
Still we can try
To make a go of it

Now we might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be
Let our hearts discover

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we
Fall in love

Now is the time for it
While we are young
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
Let's fall in love
People they have the cataract
They do not see what they look at

People they have a cataract
They cannot see what they look at
Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It looks like the sun
But it feels like the moon

Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon

Who lives in an old hotel
Near the ancient ruins
Only time can tell
Time can tell

Go easy, the doorman said
The floor is slippery
So watch your head
This message read

Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
There's a ring for your finger
It shines like the sun
But it feels like the moon
Sweet Joni from Saskatoon
Don't go, don't go too soon
Life was a bottle of alcohol
And pills and blues and gals
And every hung over mornin'
Was an unheeded warnin'
That I shared with my lost pals

And the music flowed
And my chosen road grew wider everyday
Till the highs got low and the will said no
I can't go on that way

Can't go that way, can't go that way
Yes, the highs got low and the will said no
I can't go on that way

Sugar is sweet and good prime meat
Is so hard to come by
Saccharine is 'round again
But today it's do or die

My baby is home where I belong
And this is still my day
I am hangin' on and I am comin' on strong
And I can't go on that way
Can't go that way, can't go that way
I am still hangin' on and comin' on strong
And I can't go on that way

Earth is down and next time around
I ain't goin' round again
When it comes my time, I'm gonna stop at a line
And forget where I've been

Who was it said that a life is dead
Like the summer's day
Just let her go and let a new wind blow
'Cause I can't go on that way

Can't go that way, can't go that way
Just let her go and let a new wind blow
'Cause I can't go on that way
Hey Hey Hey 

[x8]

Young girl you're the type I need
Baby you should know you are the one that I see
Everything about you is the way that I like
We can do it baby anytime of the night
Cause you stay down and you always go right
Even when we tired girl you wanna go twice

I just wanna tell you're the one that I need
Baby you're the one, the only one for me

So when we get the motion, oh, in the ocean
We keep it goin', keep, keep it goin'
I feel the lotion feel emotion
And I just gotta tell you one more time

[Chorus x2:]
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Baby you're the one, only one for me
The best damn girl I've ever seen in my life
Every time I look at you I'm proud that you're mine
You just got the shape, just the shape that I like
Everything about you got me feeling all right
So I know that we can do it, baby all night
We can make love anytime that you like

I just wanna tell you're the one that I need
Baby you're the one the only one for me

So when we get the motion, oh, in the ocean
We keep it goin', keep, keep it goin'
I feel the lotion feel emotion
And I just gotta tell you one more time

[x2:]
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Baby you're the one, only one for me

Best damn girl
Check it now mama you are the bestest
And I love the way that we dress, the freshest
You're in the passenger, I'm driving in the R8
Pumpin' that brand new shizzle, by the R.K
And I'm hardly, ever shy baby
That's why I say it lookin' at you in your eyes baby
I got the vehicle, let's take this for a ride baby
Now listen one more time

[x2:]
You're the best damn girl in the whole wide world
Baby you're the best in the whole wide world
You're the only one that I'm ever gonna need
Baby you're the one, only one for me
Best Girl

Hey Hey Hey

Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

Well I'm not braggin' babe so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)

Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like (she's) standin' still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
Shell do a hundred and forty with the top end floored
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip daddy

And comin' off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows em outta the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

When you're all alone
All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Ev'ry single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Still the old heart's young enough to say

"It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
"Truly lovely, wasn't it?"
Strings
Ev'ry single lovely day
It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, my dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down
So good-bye, my dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Just one of those things
Sittin' in my car outside your house
(Sittin' in my car outside your house)
'Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse

T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs
(T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs)
We've been having fun all summer long

(All summer long you've been with me)
I can't see enough of you
(All summer long we've both been free)
Won't be long til summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now

Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
(Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills)
When we rode the horse we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
Won't be long till summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
Yes, I quite understand
I just might have your man tonight
He'll be lookin' good Hollywood
Everything right on cue
That's a clue

If you're in town and he's around
Well, anything I can do
Maybe I could get him on the line
Yes, I think you'd like him fine
You could spend all his money, honey

He'll want a little
Just a little taste of your love
He'll need a little
Just a little bit of your love

He'll take you uptown, downtown
Up Third Avenue
So if you need a little
I'll be the middle man for you
There's a hot moon tonight
If I feel like jumping I just might
We could grab a pack go back and start
A little thing or two, me and you

I can't resist you know there's
Something I've been dying to do
Maybe we could take in all the sights
We could roll some heavy dice
And we could blow all my money, honey

I want a little
Just a little taste of your love
Not just a little
But every little trace of your love

I'll take you uptown, downtown
Up a lonely avenue
Yes I'm in the middle, smack dab middle
Man for you

I want a little
Just a little taste of your love
Need a little
Just a little taste of your love
I'll take you uptown, downtown
Down a lonely avenue
Oh, I am the middle
Yes, the middle man for you

Yes, I need a little
Just a little taste of your love
Not just a little but every little taste of your love
Uptown, uptown

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull)]
Ooh, I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds (Reportin' live from Spain)
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down (Tuxedo)
This joint has got me open
Uh that's my favorite song (Mr. Worldwide)
I put my thing in motion (I don't know how I do what I do)
I do it all night long (I just do it)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You know the résumé
Call it what you want, boy, as it may
Not from the bay, but hella paid
Every day above ground is a good day so I celebrate
Mami got that bubble-yum booty
I wanna run through it like Rudy
She said "Do you own Nike?"
I said, "Not yet", she said, "Then just do it"
Fresh at the Grammy's in a tuxedo
Play about 18 holes on any given day
Tiger Woods steelo, yeah, I get around, but only on the D-Low
Now I'm changing the world
Just to think I used to dream about kilos
Bank account used to be negative
Now it's like that thing on reload, do it

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down
This joint has got me open
Ooh, that's my favorite song
I put my thing in motion
I do it all night long

[Post-Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull)]
Do it, do it, do it
Oh, here I go again
(Gotta hit 'em with that) Do it
Do it
Do it
(Hit 'em, hit 'em with that) Do it
(Yea, go ahead baby and) Do it
(Go ahead, baby and) Do it
(Go ahead, baby, and) Do it
(That's right)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
They want what never heard before
Never seen before, never worn before
But if they only knew, everything's been done before
I'm half of an outcast like Love Below
Instagram; now they take pics
When I was growing up, Instagram was a nick
Man, what a trip
Bogota, Medellin, Colombia
Man, what a trip
If you been there
Then you know what I'm talkin' bout
I'm runnin' through the world, y'all walk it out
It's a marathon, not a sprint
Long term, that's how I think
My life could've turned out ugly
I'm talkin' ugly, generino
But I turned it all around and hit the jackpot
De Niro, Casino, dalé, woo!

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down
This joint has got me open
Ooh, that's my favorite song
I put my thing in motion
I do it all night long

[Post-Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull)]
Do it, do it, do it
Oh, here I go again
(Gotta hit 'em with that) Do it
Do it
Do it
(Hit 'em, hit 'em with that) Do it
(Yeah, go ahead, baby, and) Do it
(Go ahead, baby, and) Do it
(Go ahead, baby, and) Do it

[Bridge: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull), Both]
(That's right, take it to the bridge)
Been working hard and now the weekend is here
Give it your best shot
Show me what you got (It's time to)
Light one, put it in the atmosphere
Give it your best shot
Show me what you got
I got that lightning feeling from my head to my toes
Give it your best shot
Show me what you got
So tonight, I'm really gonna let myself go
(Give it your best shot)
Show me what you got

[Outro: Pitbull]

Jump out the sandbox
Come play with these big boys
You know we're cooler than a polar bear toe nails
Oh yea
That's right

[Intro]
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh whoa whoa oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoa whoa oh

[Verse 1]
It seems we've lost our touch
Used to be so in love, yeah, uh
But somehow we've gotten off track
And we never really got it back, no, yeah
I think we better find a way, yeah
And get right back to them good old days, good old days
Wanna make it to Heaven's gate, yeah (oh)
And we need to escalate, I need...

[Chorus]
I need direction (I need direction)
To that street called love (to that street called love, yeah)
Lead me to that road (trying to get home, yeah)
Trying to get home (oh, take me to love street, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now life has gone and skipped a beat
Tell me where are all the dancing feet, yeah
Boy, I tell you there's always something going on
Tell me why can't we all just get along
Keep struggling (yeah) just to get by, oh (oh)
So many hills, mountains to climb, yeah
We should all be ashamed of ourselves
'Cause if we don't love ourselves
Tell me how can we love somebody else?

[Chorus]
I need direction (we need direction)
To that street called love (to that street called love, yeah)
Lead me to that road (I'm trying to get home)
Trying to get home (come on and take me to Love Street)

[Bridge]
Sunday morning (yeah)
People are dressed up (yeah)
Ready to go and have some...church
(And I remember feeling so joyful)
On the Eastside or the Westside
Or the Northside or the Southside
You were at...church
(So tell me what is all this fighting for)
So what is all this pouting about? (whoa)
And what is all this hating about? (whoa)
(We have got to figure out
How to get right back to Love Street)

[Chorus]
I need directions (we need direction, woah)
To that street called love (to that street called love)
Lead me to that road (trying to get home)
Trying to get home (would you take me straight to Love Street)
I need direction (I need some direction, yeah)
To that street called love (yes I do, yes I do, yeah)
Lead me to that road (please let me lead me to that road)
Trying to get home

[Bridge]
Heard somebody say (Toot-toot-beep-beep)
Heard somebody say (Tell me how to get to love street) yeah
Heard somebody say (Toot-toot-beep-beep) yeah
Heard somebody say, yeah (Tell me how to get to love street) Yeah
Here we go, here we go, here we go

You make a right on L
Make a left on O
Come to a green light
And that's when you can go
You keep straight on V
Until you come to E
That's when you see a big sign that says
Welcome to Love Street

[Chorus]
I need direction (welcome to my street)
To that street called love (yeah yeah, welcome,  yeah, hey)
Lead me to that road (Lead me to that road, yeah)
Trying to get home (Oh yeah oh)

(Tell me how to get to Love Street)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah, whoa
(Tell me how to get to Love Street)

[Outro]
Pied Piper, your music weatherman
It's love o'clock y'all
And y'all listening to the sounds of the Chocolate Factory
This next one goes out to the ladies
Ladies' Night, Happy People, baby!
Don't want to live in New York City, man
Don't want to live in Tokyo
I want to stay in my own village, man
Is nowhere else I need to go
Is nothing that I want for myself
That I don't want for everyone
To work in peace, to live in freedom
To look and never see a gun

Why are you calling this the third world
I only know that it is my world
Maybe someday it can be our world
Can you imagine one world, one world
Yeah, oh yeah

My heart it hurts more than my belly
So hard to live in poverty
I want to work for my own living, man
Don't want someone to care for me
Don't want to speak of revolution
It started sounding like a fight
I give myself to evolution
One world will make it be all right
Why are you calling this the third world
I only know that it is my world
Maybe someday it can be our world
Can you imagine one world, one world
Yeah

This world is made for everybody
This life is gift for everyone
This earth is bound to keep on turning
This day is flowers in the sunshine, sunshine
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Why are youe calling this the third world
I only know that it is my world
Maybe someday it will be our world
Can you imagine, someday, one world, one world

Why are we calling this the third world
I only know that it is my world
Maybe someday it can be our world
Can you imagine one world, one world
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Only one world
May it be one world
Only one world, yeah, one world
Only one world, yeah, one world, one world
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda!
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart
But I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wonderin' how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz tell her how you feel

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave ya
They call me heartbreaker
I don't wanna deceive ya

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Bridge 2: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 3: Taio Cruz]
There's not point tryin' to hide it
No point tryin' to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehaving

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
(That's all I'm gonna do, woman)
Listen, now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
Then it's finders keepers and losers weepers
See I'm not tryin to lead you on, no, I'm only tryin to keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris but Taio Cruz tell her how you feel

[Bridge: Taio Cruz]
Hey and I know karma's gonna get me back for bein' so cold
Hey, like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
Hey, if you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Hey, told ya from the start, hey

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Bridge 2: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I got a million things that I'd rather do
Than to play rock ’n’ roll for you
Honey, if I blow your fuse
Can I please be excused?
Gotta right myself today
I can’t right myself for you
We haven’t even been introduced
So that’ll never do
Though a lot of other people could
Standing here instead of me
Singing their own lines
Through clenching, cracking teeth
Gotta right myself today
Gotta right myself for you
Honey, if I tell you the truth
Can I please be excused?
Honey, let’s not get carried away
There’s a lot of other places to be
A lot of things I would rather be doing
A lot of songs I’d love to sing
But I know that you would just ruin it
Gotta right myself today
I gotta right myself for you
Honey, if I tell you the truth
Can I please be excused?
Honey, let’s not get carried away
Gotta right myself today
I gotta right myself for you
Honey, if I tell you the truth
Can I please be excused?

[Verse 1]
Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be

[Verse 2]
Wildflower
Sweet as the morning light, if I blink an eye, will you go
I'm starting to care much more than I dare
A wonderful thing to see
And what do we know

[Chorus]
First say you love me and then say you leave me
But we never say good-bye
God, you're an angel
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine

[Verse 3]
Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise, one look in your eyes
I'm younger than I should be and only time
Waiting for you to grow

[Chorus]
First say you love me and then say you'll leave me
But we never say goodbye
God, you're an angel
But only an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine

[Verse 3]
Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise, one look in your eyes
I'm younger than I should be and only time
Waiting for you to grow

[Outro: Ad-libbed]
I always say, comme ci comme ca,*
And go my way, comme ci comme ca
Since you are gone, nothing excites me
Since you are gone, no one delights me
And I go on, comme ci comme ca
Midnight till dawn, comme ci comme ca
But should we meet, that would excite me
And should you smile, that would delight me
I'd live again to love again
But until then, comme ci comme ca

It seems my friends have been complaining
They say that I've been acting rude
But I have never liked explaining
Which may explain my attitude
Comme ci comme ca
Comme ci comme ca
Since you are gone, nothing excites me
Since you are gone, no one delights me
Hmm, hmm
Tira, rirum
But should we meet, that would excite me
And should you smile, that would delight me
I'd live again to love again
But until then, comme ci comme ca

[Intro]
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I hear 'em tell me that they love the music (Well, well well)
And even how some of the songs has gotten them through (Yeah)
And through the years I've heard nothin' but "Keep doin' it" (Oh yeah)
They even say to me "I've got kids 'cause of you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, here's to all the '90s babies
Single mothers or daddy's maybes
Whether rich or whether poor
This who this song is for

[Chorus]
'Cause I know that you were (Born to my music)
Oh, wherever, whoever you are, you were (Born to my music)
Oh, generations, populations, you were (Born to my music)
And it's such a blessing
Thank you, heaven (Born to my music)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I've heard 'em tell me, "Boy, you are gifted" (Oh)
And some have even said "Your music's uplifting" (Yeah)
I heard people say that "Come what may, you are the King" (Yeah)
And it feels so good to hear them say "Your music has touched me"

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, here's to all the '90s babies
Single mothers or daddy's maybes
Whether rich or whether poor
This who this song is for

[Chorus]
'Cause I know that you were (Born to my music)
Oh wherever, whoever you are, you were (Born to my music)
Oh, generations, populations, you were (Born to my music)
And it's such a blessing
Thank you, heaven (Born to my)

[Bridge]
People tell me "Thank you for the memories you've given me"
And I just say it's, "My pleasure", yeah
"Robert Kelly, what you've done for music has made history"
"Your music is forever"
So to all of my loyal fans
I thank y'all for the dance
I feel so blessed to be a part of all of y'all memories
So thankful to be a part of touching the whole world's heart

[Chorus]
At least, those of who are (Born to my music)
And I'm so grateful (Born to my music)
To know that so many were (Born to my music)
And it puts a joy down in my soul (Born to my music)
To know that, you are (Born to my music)
You are (Born to my music)
You were, aye (Born to my music)
You were (Born to my music)
Yes, you were (Born to my music)
Born to my music
I thank God for the music (Born to my music)
Born to my music
And it feels good to know that you were
Born to my music, oh (Born to my music)
Born to my music, whoa (Born to my music)
Born to my music, whoa (Born to my music)
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so dang hard
But you don't understand
What you'll say
When you get home

When you something is happening
You don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"
You know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You pay for your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And he asks you how it feels
To be such a freak
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone

And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
Who keep you supplied with facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations

[Instrumental break]

You've been with the professors
And they all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

The sword swallower comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
Without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"

And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You see this one-eyed midget
And he's shouting the word "NOW"
You say, "What's the matter?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"

And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
Your eyes in your pockets
And your head on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

And you know something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Feel a chill in the dark
Twilight falls
Feel the beat of your heart
Danger calls

Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...

Well I'm planning it out
Day by day
There's no room for doubt
Just one way

Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...

And I'm looking out over West Berlin
Feeling freer now than I've ever been
When the sun sets over West Berlin
I'll be leaving, I can't come back again
And I'm looking out over West Berlin
West Berlin
In the flood of the light
Safety will shine
We'll be high out of sight
On steel cable line

Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...

And I'm looking out over West Berlin
Feeling freer now than I've ever been
When the sun sets over West Berlin
I'll be leaving, I can't come back again
And I'm looking out over West Berlin
West Berlin
I have but one heart, this heart I bring you
I have but one heart to share with you
I have but one dream that I can cling to
You are the one dream I pray comes true
My darling, until I saw you, I never felt this way
And nobody else before you, ever has heard me say
You are my one love, my life I live for you
I have but one heart to give to you

*Dicimo o mari, facimu l'amore
*A curi a curi che ci passa
*Ca u mare parla e na' carezza
*Ma a tia la brezza, fina murir
You are my one love, my love I live for you
I have but one heart to give to you

[Verse 1]
Just you and me, girl - yes, two of a kind
And I'm so proud, proud to have you
And you're mine, all mine
And I love you so, girl - girl, I love you so

Oh, just you and me girl
And nobody else, nobody else
You gave your love to me, nobody else
And I, and I love you so
Girl, girl, I love you so, yeah

[Chorus]
And oh, and now you know
How lucky I am, oh, now you know
To have a good woman standing by my, my side

[Verse 2]
Oh, I promise you girl - yes, I promise you girl
And you promise me
We've got to stay, got to stay together
That's the way we said it had to be
And I love you, girl
You know, girl, you know how much I love you so, yeah
And woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
So many years keep passing, passing us by
You know, know either ways darling, baby
I love you 'til the day I die, love you so, yeah
Girl, girl, I love you so

[Chorus]
And woo, and now, now, now, now, now you know
How lucky, now you know how lucky I am
Oh, now you know, now you know
To have a good woman standing by my side

[Outro]
And I don't have to worry, girl
Oh, you'll be by my side
And I promise you, girl, I'll always be there for you
Time as I've known it
Doesn't take much time to pass by me
Minutes into days turn into months turn into years
They hurry by me

Still I love to see the sun go down
And the world go around

Dreams full of promises
Hopes for the future
I've had many

Dreams I can't remember now
Hopes that I've forgotten
Faded memories

Still I love to see the sun go down
And the world go around

And I love to see the morning
As it steals across the sky
I love to remember
And I love to wonder why
And I hope that I'm around
So I can be there when I die
When I'm gone

I hope that you will think of me
In moments when you're happy
And you're smiling

And that the thought will comfort you
On cold and cloudy days
If you are crying

And that you'll love to see the sun go down
And the world go around
And around and around

[Chorus]
I read your text saying what you wanna do to me (All night long)
I think I might be able fulfill your fantasy
We can ride away, no time to waste, tonight baby (All night long)
We can ride away, no time to waste, tonight baby

[Verse 1]
Walking up dirty street, she was caught over the beat, oooh the way she looked at me
She's out of space like Anakin, body like a mannequin, sipping on a girly drink
Dancing on the table, life of the party, got my tongue on her navel, taking shots of her body
Yea this little hottie, she's trying to get me sprung, and she's sucking on cherries tying knots with her tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo girl, it's you girl, I love it when you're teasing me
Ooo girl, the things you do girl, I love it when you're pleasing me

[Chorus]
You wanna get it shawty (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
You got me thanking, baby (All night long)
You need a spanking, baby (All night long)
You wanna get it, shawty (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
You got me thanking, baby (All night long)
You need a spanking, baby (All night long)

[Verse 1]
Walking down dirty street, party rockin to the beat, oooh the way he looked at me
He's out of space like Anakin, body like a mannequin, sipping on some Hennessy
Dancing on the table, life of the party, he's got his tongue on my navel, taking shots of my body
Yea I'm feeling naughty, I'm trying to get it sprung, while I'm sucking on this lollipop, you can be my lollipop

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, boy, I want you, boy, I love it when you're teasing me
Oooh, boy, the things you do, boy, I love it when you're pleasing me

[Chorus]
You wanna get it shawty (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
You got me thanking, baby (All night long)
You need a spanking, baby (All night long)
You wanna get it, shawty (All night long)
Then keep acting on it (All night long)
You got me thanking, baby (All night long)
You need a spanking, baby (All night long)

[Bridge]
Now everybody say oh, oh, oh, ooh
Now everybody say oh, oh, oh, ooh
Now everybody say oh, oh, oh, ooh
Now everybody say oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Outro]
I read your text saying what you wanna do to me (All night long)
I think I might be able fulfill your fantasy
We can ride away, no time to waste, tonight, baby (All night long)
We can ride away, no time to waste, tonight, baby
Intro (J. Reyez):
Alright, I do this for all of you
I make music for love, the love of everything
J. Reyez... Bruno Mars...
C'mon!

Verse 1 (J. Reyez):
When I wake up next to you girl
It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds
You're beautiful and you're always shining
Your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds
Many people are there, but you're worth keeping
The same letters, three words and one meaning
I love you, but we have our little arguments
That don't stop untill we forgot who started it
I blank out and the thoughts around in me
You and I, everytime you smiled at me
And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you
Your eyes, the world I see in you
And time never goes to waste
Don't change, cuz you can never be replaced
This love, you can never rearrange
Everytime when I see your face
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Verse 2 (J. Reyez):
Just the way you express with "ing" girl
You're nothing short of my everything
And every memory so sentimental
Your happiness is my essential

This a way for me to say thanks
No stress, I want you to give me strenght
When I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect
But to the world you're just one person
But to that person you mean the world is just
How we ride, me and my girl, uhh
We do this Bonnie and Clyde shit
We fall together, we coincided
The way to my heart it was hard to find it
But you found dead deep down inside of this love
You can never rearrange
Everytime when i see your face
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are (x2)
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah-ahh
Lay me, La-La Lay me
La-La Lay me
La-La Lay me down
Lay me, La-La Lay me
La-La Lay me
La-La, Lay me down
Lay me, La-La Lay me
La-La Lay me
La-La, Lay me down
I feel weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up
I'm no fool, but it's said
You gotta walk a mile 'til you're outta my head
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Nile)
I got the time, it'll be alright, yeah, I got the time
That you need (yeah)
We all bleed, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it outta the frame
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Can your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (yeah)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

La-la-lay me down
La-la- lay me
La-la-lay me down
La-la-lay me

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks + The Temptations]
I've got a lover way over there on the mountainside
And I know that's where I should be (got a love, got a love)
Don't you know I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, but she's calling my name (calling my name)
So sweet and so plain, and I can hear her saying
Come on, come on
I'm on my way
Come on, come on
I'm gonna stay
Come on, come on

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks + The Temptations]
Ah, they tell me that the river's too deep and it's much too wide
Boy, you can't make it over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying...
Come on, come on
I'm on my way
Come on, come on
I'm gonna stay
Come on, come on
I'm gonna get to you
Come on, come on
No matter what I have to do
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks + The Temptations]
Lord, they tell me that the river's too deep and it's much too wide
Oh, you can't make it over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying...
Come on, come on
I'm on my way
Come on, come on
I'm gonna stay
Come on, come on
Baby, when I get there
Come on, come on
I ain't going nowhere
Come on, come on
No, because a river ain't deep enough
Come on, come on
The mountain ain't steep enough to keep me from your side
Come on, come on, come on
Come on
Come on, come on
I'm comin'
Come on, come on, come on
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you

For the last time we have tasted
Love's sweet tears by the fire's glow
If our hearts are strong there'll be
No long good-byes when it's time to go
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken
And the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves
Where they never show

Dream away, child, let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you

When the Winter weds the Northern Wind
The child they bear is snow
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids
But the trees will grow
Sun and Earth in time will come together
God will give us back our summer weather
But the mem'ries of that first sweet
Taste of love pass away so slow
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you

When there's no room left to live inside ourselves
Do we dream away
I was five and she was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
And we grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

"Bang bang, I shot you down"
"Bang bang, you hit the ground"
"Bang bang, that awful sound"
"Bang bang, I used to shoot you down"

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Now she's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
She didn't even say "goodbye"
She didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, she shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
In his place is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married ?", We'll say "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town."

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though you know, kids are chillin'
We'll frolick & play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a Winter Wonderland (wo oh oh ...)

[repeat last line to fade]
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?

Barbara
Barbara
Barbara, my love

If Barbara were an angel
I pray she'd watch over me
If Barbara were a queen
Her servant I would be

If Barbara would be mine
And wear my high school ring
Then I'd climb the highest mountain
Do just anything

If Barbara were the winter chill
I'd stand out in the cold
If Barbara were a tree
Her branches I would hold

If Barbara would love me
And say that she'd be mine
I'd swim the deepest ocean
Stop the hands of time
Barbara please say
(That you're the one in love with me)
Don't let me lead
(This life, this life of misery)
Oh, oh, oh

Let me kiss your tender lips
And know your secret charms
And let me know what real love is
And hold you in my arms

And if this love I pray for
Should it all come true
Then with all my heart, dear
I'd love no one but you

I'll hold you in my arms
For now and ever more
And we will walk together
Through love's sacred door

Barbara
Barbara
Barbara, my love

Barbara
Barbara
Barbara, my love

I’m a lover not a fighter but every night you decide to start some shit
I’m sick and tired of being so sick and tired
Comin’ home from tour you yelling before I get through the door
With that so and so said this and that
Why you still with me for?
Goin’ through my phone I made you feel like a fool
Screaming, "Who the fuck is Alex"?
When Alexander’s my dude
Sometimes I think you do it simply cause you’re bored
If you really loved me we’d be making love not war
But you’d rather waste the little time we do have
Going back and forth
Are you sorry now? Well too bad!
I can’t believe I wasted all this fucking time
Instead of fighting with you I could have been writing rhymes or...
Hanging out with Stitch and watchin’ "Up" or something

You never tried to meet me halfway
You played these little immature ass ga-ay-aymes
I tried to be the best man I can but you were too dumb to understand
That I can have any girl but I stayed with you
I guess everybody plays the foo-ooh-ool and
Now you think you’re coming back to me
But that’s something that I just don’t see
I thought this was forever the thought of leaving you never
But you gotta kick rocks cause your screaming’s leaving my head hurt
Before you go there’s something that you should know
I’m taking everything I bought and you better leave me my red shirt
Don’t even think of twisting this to make it my fault
Or try to tell me you forgot to take your Midol
Cause you ain’t blaming this one on your period
And you can save the song and dance cause I’m gone, period!
Huh? What? Wait? Nope I’m not hearing it
The crash dummy final grabbed the wheel and now he’s steering it
Oh, dear God… what a disaster
And I probably shoulda done something faster
Wait, you know what? You can kiss my ass
You’ve been dropped from the label and I’m keepin’ your masters
"Travie you’re a bastard!"
Call me what you want to
Whatever makes you feel better, I don’t want you
P.S. I froze all your accounts and uh… leave that ring on the counter

You never tried to meet me halfway
You played these little immature ass ga-ay-aymes
I tried to be the best man I can but you were too dumb to understand
That I can have any girl but I stayed with you
I guess everybody plays the foo-ooh-ool man
Now you think you’re coming back to me
But that’s something that I just don’t see
You never tried to meet me halfway
You played these little immature ass ga-ay-aymes
I tried to be the best man I can but you were too dumb to understand
That I can have any girl but I stayed with you
I guess everybody plays the foo-ooh-ool man
Now you think you’re coming back to me
But that’s something that I just don’t see
Now you think you’re coming back to me
But that’s something that I just don’t see
CHORUS

Girl you are mine, mine, mine
Girl you are mine, mine, mine

VERSE 1
Even though we fuss and fight
I don't wanna live one night without you
So what am I gonna do, baby?

Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
And I just can't tell you why
But I love you
And you know it's true, cause girl you know

CHORUS (2 Xs)

VERSE 2
Even though the seasons change
Our love remains the same
Forever, we'll be together
And every time I try to leave
Your love keeps calling me
That's when I know
That I can't let you go, cause girl you are mine

CHORUS (2 Xs)

BRIDGE
My days are incomplete
When you're away from me
I find it hard sometimes for me to breathe

Said I need you in my life
Beside me all the time
Without you there's no me, cause you're…

CHORUS to end with ad lib
Oh Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
From Glen to Glen
And down the mountain side

The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you
Must go and die must bide

But come here back
When summer's in the meadow
And when the valley's hushed
And white with snow

It's I'll be here
In sunshine or in shadows
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy
I miss you so

But if you fall
As all the flowers are dying
And you are dead
As dead you will may be
I'll come and find
A place where you are lying
And kneel and say
An ave there for thee

But come here back
When summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed
And white with snow

It's I'll be here
In sunshine or in shadows
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy
I love you so
Hey, Pearl, what's bugging you, girl?
(Too much knowledge, Frank, too much knowledge.)
Explain it to me
(Well, it was down at school at the age of six.)
One of the real quiz kids
(Yeah , so did reason and lightning touch.)
Usual thought
(As time went on, I studied lots of, oh, the other things.)
Uh huh, like a
(No, most of them didn't hurt much.)
Well, I've had other teachers
(Well I got my diploma, I was real real smart.)
In a pretty frame, huh?
(Of my knowledge there was no doubt.)
That's pretty obvious
(Yeah but lately I've had the same, like in your words too,)
(It wasn't even a thought, let me tell you what I found out now.)
Look at the size of my ears, pour it on
(You know it started with a man.)
Uh huh!
(And the man he was grand.)
Ain't that the truth
(He had a lie that would make a bird sing.)
This kid really came on, I can see that
'Cause you were much too smart to be afraid at the start
(Frank, a little learnin' is a dangerous thing.)
Well, I'd like to hear some more
(First he only wanted two.)
To?
(Then he changed it to few.)
Oh, you mean loot
(I even loaned that man my watch and my ring.)
Oh, you lost your head, Pearl, completely
'Cause you were hip to the fact that he would pay you right back
(Yep, a little learning is a dangerous thing.)
Uh huh. Yes, with his sweetheart, his so discreet heart
(Oh Frank, he had me doing things that I shouldn't do.)
That cad, ain't no denying, so sense in trying
(Let me tell you, it is just as bad. My education's been like some book.)
Bet you had an encyclopedia
(Yet now I know the score at last.)
So I'm happy for you
(I'm an gal with a past that left my head hot and perched in a sling.)
You mean you got yourself in hock?
(Yes, it's understood that brother gypped me but good,)
(A little learning) can be a dangerous thing
Yeah girl that's the kind of stuff you gotta watch out for
(Oh makes me so nervous.)
That's right, it shakes you up...
One Sunday morning as I went walking
By Brisbane Waters I chanced to stray
I heard a convict his fate bewailing
As on the sunny riverbank he lay

I am a native of Erin's Ireland
But banished now from my native shore
They stole me from my aged parents
And from the maiden whom I do adore

I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
At Castle Hill and the cursed Toongabbie
At all these settlements I've been in chains

But of all places of condemnation
And penal stations in New South Wales
To Moreton Bay I have found no equal
Excessive tyranny each day prevails

For three long years I was beastly treated
And heavy irons on my legs I wore
My back from flogging was lacerated
And oft times painted with my crimson gore
And many a man from downright starvation
Lies mouldering now underneath the clay
And Captain Logan he had us mangled
All On the triangles of Moreton Bay

Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
We were oppressed under Logan's yoke
Till a native black lying there in ambush
Did deal this tyrant with his mortal stroke

My fellow prisoners be exhilarated
That all such monsters like death may find
And when from bondage we're liberated
Our former suffering shall will fade from mind
Springtime comes and the leaves are back on the trees again
Snipers are harder to see my friends
Weeding out the weekends

Summer comes and gravity undoes you
You're happy because of the lovely way the sunshine bends
Hiding from your close friends
Weeding out the weekends

Candy left over from Halloween
A unified theory of everything
Love left over from lovers leaving
Books, they all know they're not worth reading
It's not for the season

When autumn comes you sit in your chair and you stare
At the tv square
Hiding in the deep end
Weeding out the weekends

Winter comes and the days all start late
There's motion on the boughs where the dark shapes prowl
Feeling out the feelings
Feeling out the feeling
Candy left over from Halloween
A unified theory of everything
Love left over from lovers leaving
Books, they all know they're not worth reading
They're not worth reading
Bring a drink of water Leroy bring a drink of water (no)
If I could get to mercy man he's give me some I know
I got a gal in Vickburg Bertha is her name
Lord I Wish I's tied to Bertha instead of this ball and chain
I'm goin' to Memphis (that's right Lord) yeah (uh huh)

Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's thru and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah Memphis

I never been to Chicago but it must be a mighty fine place (that's right)
I couldn't get past Tennessee with Mississippi all over my face (uh huh)
I'm goin' to Memphis (that's right Lord Memphis)

Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's thru and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah Memphis

Well I brought me a little water in a Mr Prince Albert can
But the bossman caught me drinkin' it and I believe he broke my hand (hm hm)
Well another boy is down the shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body to see what the shoutin's about
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah I'm goin' to Memphis hmm
Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's thru and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah Memphis
I'd like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys in your heart
I'd like to know how far you'd go to use those lips of wine
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

Oh, one, two, three and now there's me
You practice to deceive
You lead me on , another one
I've got no room to breathe

So byebye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

Oh, one, two, three and now there's me
You practice to deceive
You lead me on, another one
I've got no room to breathe

So byebye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind
Too many boys on your mind
Too many boys on your mind
In the marmalade forest 

[forest]
Between the make believe trees
In a cottage cheese cottage
Lives Albi 

[Albi] Albi 

[Albi]
Albi the racist dragon

Part 6

And so all the people of the village
Chased Albi the racist dragon into
A very cold very scary cave and it
Was so cold and scary in there that
Albi began to cry dragon tears
Which as we all know turn into jellybeans!

Anyway just at that moment he felt a
Tiny little hand rest apon his tail. And who should that little hand belong to, but the badly burnt Albanian boy from the day before

'What are you doing here I thought I killed you yesterday'
Grumbled Albi quite racistly
'No Albi, you didn't kill me with your dragon flames, I
Crawled to safety but you did leave me very badly disfigured, '
Laughed the boy
'Why are you crying? '
I'm crying because all of the
Villagers chased me here, I
Think it's because I'm so racist. '
'No Albi they chased me here too, when I became all disfigured like this
They just don't like you and I. Because... Well because we're different to them

And with that, Albi cried a single tear, which turned into a jellybean all the colours of the rainbow! And Albi wasn't racist anymore!

So they sat in the cave 

[cave]
And ate bubble gum pie 

[yum! ]
Albi the racist – well, not anymore - Dragon... !

[Intro]
I'm about to go to Loveland
Do you wanna go with me?
I'm about to go to Loveland
Do you wanna go with me?
I'm about to go to Loveland
Do you wanna go with me?
I'm about to go to Loveland
Do you wanna go with me? Come on

[Verse 1]
Ooh, it's unbelievable
How your body feels next to mine
Ooh, it's uncontrollable
How you put it down every time
Girl, you know that you got me
Going up and down
Fulfilling my greatest fantasy
Stroking it round and round
I don't know what else to do but love you, sugar
So come on, let's cuddle up and make sweet love
You don't need a ticket, just get on board
I'm about to take you into Loveland

[Chorus]
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around (Come on, sugar)
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around

[Verse 2]
Ooh, we don't know (We don't know)
What tomorrow will bring
So we're gonna make this last forever
I'm about to taste your love
'Til you can't take it anymore, sweetheart
Imagine that, said I'm guaranteed to make your body come to me
Hey baby, I'm gonna set your soul free
Girl, I'm about to take you into Loveland

[Chorus]
Step in my room
Take your clothes off (Come on)
Hit the shower
Let you hair down (Let your hair down)
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around

[Bridge]
It takes love for the world to go round and round
Even though it has its ups and down
Joy is the key to my soul
Anyone unlock me
Woo, Lord have mercy

[Chorus]
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down

Me on top of you rolling around
Step in my room

Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around
Step in my room
Take your clothes off
Hit the shower
Let you hair down
Get in my bed
Making sounds
Me on top of you rolling around
This is the beginning of the end
I can see it in your eyes, in everything you do
And you're afraid to tell me that we're through
But I can tell by looking at you
This is the beginning of the end
You just give yourself away with everything you say
And though you never told me we must part
Still I can read the writing in your heart
Why is it now when I hold your hand
There is some little something that I miss
What has become of the warmth in your smile
And where is that little mischief in your goodnight kiss?
This is the beginning of the end
I can see the thrill is gone, why let it linger on
Why lie to me and say it isn't so
For when I hold you in my arms I know
That this, this is the beginning of the end
Go out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Has anybody seen my lady
This living alone will drive me crazy
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I'm gonna go down by the wa-ter
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no
I'll just be looking for my mak-er
And I hear that that's where she's been? Oh!
Out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I just spent sixty days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go
Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you trying to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
Sit alone and hide my sorrows while you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
Written by Peter Green

Now, when I leave this town
Won't be - back no more
Yes, when I leave this town, mama
Won't be back no more
I've got the blues so bad
Standing 'round my door

Yes, I got the blues so bad
Why won't you let me be
I have the blues so bad, mama
Why won't you let me be
Now, when I go to Chicago
Blues don't you follow me

Break:

I'm asking mama, mama
Please don't cry no tears
Yes, I say mama, mama
Please don't cry no tears
Because I'll always love you
Through all my days and years
Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall you fall
And I'm thinking
I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I know

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I know
In the shadow of the moon, there's a bright and shining place
Where two hearts can learn to share love beyond all time and space
Though the candle barely glows through the haze
Touch my hand, what it plays
Till a woman and a man learn to think and feel as one
They must journey through the dark, then one day they'll find that sun
We can own each silver star up above, simply love me, my love

[brief instrumental]

We can share the joy we're both dreaming of, if you'll love me, my love

After the show you walked right past
Arms reached out for your autograph
And as you flashed your backstage pass
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
When the band came out, they stood behind you
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
You stood alone in the halo's haze
Shinny guitar hung on gold lamay
And you, you were the lonely 1
You were the lonely 1
When you perform it's so intense
When the critics pan I write in your defense
I understand I'm just a fan, I'm just a fan
When I get home I turn off the alarm
I've checked the phone, no messages on
I play the ones from yesterday
I play you're song just to hear you say that
You, you're the lonely 1
You are the lonely 1
You, you're the lonely 1
You are the lonely 1
Speak low, when you speak love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon
Oh, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I dont know when
But she dont notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin to myself
Shes sure fine lookin man, shes something else

Hey, look over there
Across the street
Theres a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxery
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guessthe cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinkin to myself
That cars fine lookin man, it something else

Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
Im gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go ridin around
Well go to the shop a right block down
Ill keep on right on dreamin and thinkin to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, thats something else
Look a-here
Whats all this
Never thought Id do this before
But here I am a-knockin on a door
My cars out front
And its all mine
Justa 41 ford not a 59
Ive got that girl and Im a thinkin to myself
Shes sure fine lookin man, wow, shes something else
You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of Hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down a river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the street with the good time girl

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the Disco King
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive
Feed me no lies
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the head of the Disco King

Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the 70's
Smelling of love thru' the moist wind
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Tell me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the Disco King
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
Dead or alive
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside, oh
And who is the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now
Now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
And if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night
Good night
I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are, oh
And you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shinning star

And where are you now
Now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
And if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night
Good night

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taking me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
And if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
It's just emotion that's taking me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
And if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world
You're breakin' my heart baby
And there ain't a damn thing I can do
Yes, you got me wringin' my hands and cryin' baby
Well, you're breakin' my heart in two
Well, it's not easy for me to believe woman
That you are doin' the things you do

Well, it's so hard for me to believe baby
It's hard for me to believe you would do me wrong
Yes, please have mercy baby
Won't you stay here where you belong?
Well you know I got the blues
I got the blues so bad now baby
Sometimes you make me wish
Make me wish I'd never, never been born

Yes, I want to know why did you let me
Why did you let me love you so long baby?
Why did you use me like a tool?
Yes, you played a game with my heart woman
Baby you know you used the devils rule
Here's that feeling once again
Across the room you turn and then
Smile - I've known that smile before
Yes we've been friends for sure
Dreams and memories so clear
Share the love that we once had
Let the music carry on
Keep on dancing

Summer nights - here on that shoreline
Meet again - and drink that wine
This old wine - still thinking of you
Missing all the things you do

Here in the falling rain
Once again we play love's game
Keep on dancing

You cast that magic
Déjà-vu - it's in your stars
They reveal - you know the answer
They are true - so for a while
Let's renew all those lovers' ties
Summer lightning in your eyes
It keeps on dancing

I've always known love
Would return to lighten the darkest day
We will meet again
Further on in later lifetime
Past the skyline, I'll always be your friend
Send my love to you
There'll be no sad goodbyes
There was a guy where I am from
Smothered his dog in bubblegum
Ain't that sad
Who would'a thought he'd be that bad
A wishbone was broken
I'm left holding the smaller part
With words left unspoken
They rattle round in my empty heart
Help me start to lay this burden down
On the solid ground

How many people hold the ones they love
Just like there's no tomorrow
How many people know the turning hands of time
Are stranger than us all

Time's always walkin'
I check my watch you'd be forty-five
It seems like God just ain't talkin'
I wish to God you were still alone
Every night I wonder where you are
Holding half my heart

How many people hold the ones they love
Just like there's no tomorrow
How many people know the turning hands of time
Are stranger than us all
All the days are gone the nights go on
Help me hear the words, "walk on"

How many people hold the ones they love
Just like there's no tomorrow
How many people know the turning hands of time
Are stranger than us all

I wish I would have told you that
The air you breathe was everything;
Some men were born in poverty some were born with wealth
I was born a lovin' man and I just can't help myself
The women have all made over this old boy ever since I was born
That's why these old Arkansas travelin' shoes are so well worn

I've made quite a name for myself the girls know who I am
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man yes I am
Now in every little town that I've been in the story is the same
The girls all keep on a hangin' around playin' them lovin' games

But sometimes I wish them women folks would leave this old boy alone
I've thought about catchin' that next Greyhound back to my Arkansas home
But there ain't no use in kiddin' myself I like the way I am
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man

Oh yes I am
Now you look here woman that look in your eyes says maybe you love me so
But if you turn loose of my coatail I'll get my bedroll and go
'Cause I ain't nowhere near the kind of a fella that'll settle down
I've got a natural talent for lovin' and I'm gonna spred it around
If I ever come back your way again remember who I am
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man
I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man yes I am

First time I saw you
I was kinda taken by surprise
You were, sun kissed, so full of bliss
You really had me mesmerized
And now it's something about the way
You do where you knock me off my feet
I'm lost inside of you
And I don't think I can leave
You already had me at "hello"
I said 'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun
Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up yeah ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya
Will somebody pinch me now
Cause it kinda feels like a dream
I got shades on my head, my feet in the sand
Ain't worried 'bout a thing
When the sun goes down
And the lights come on
You got me feeling just like a star
And no matter where I go
You're always at my heart
You already had me at "hello"...
I said "Hey L.A."
It's really really nice to meet ya
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun
Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up yeah ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya
Now if you can make it here
You can make it anywhere
And it's not always easy
But there's no place that I'd rather be
I said "Hey L.A."
It's really really nice to meet ya
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun
Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up yeah ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya
Na na na na
L.A
It's really really nice to meet ya
Cause I just wanna have some fun
Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up yeah ready for a good time
Hey L.A
It's really really cool to be here yeah
All or nothing... push
All or nothing... Girl let it be
Night after night it starts the same
Talking with my baby on lovers lane
You're real sweet and all a glow
Turn me on and then you're ready to go
I ask her, baby can I walk you home
She says okay I hate to be alone
I'm dreaming, you're smiling
You're my girl
My fantasy in this world
Nothing is wrong with being in love
It's a wonderful feeling from heaven above
Squeeze me
Please me
Turn me on
I love you so much
You can never go wrong
I like your smile
I like your touch
All or nothing
'Cos I want you so much
I'm longing for your tender kiss
Baby I wanna tell you this :
(Chorus)
All or nothing... push
It's got to be
Something's gotta show
When you're living under heat
All or nothing... push
Girl let it be
Take it from a pro
Who's rocking to the beat
I'm under heat oh baby
Please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe
Our love will grow
I wanna suit you baby
And make it right
Take it from me babe
I wanna rock all night
If it's good for me
It's good for you, you gotta
Never let your mood get dry
Just keep it wet and my 740 jet
Is pushing right on high
You're the girl of my dream
You're making me hot
You're looking good
You're too ot to trot
I wanna be with you through all the hours and shower you with all my
Flowers
I like your smile
I like your touch
All or nothing
'Cos I want you so much
I'm longing for your tender kiss
Baby I wanna tell you this :
(Repeat Chorus)
I'm under heat oh baby
Please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe
Our love will grow
I wanna suit you baby
And make it right
Take it from me babe
I wanna rock all night

(Repeat Chorus)
When I'm alone, my mind takes a drive
Through chocolate religion and spirits alive
All I was brought up in this world 2 know
Is lost when a demon swallows them whole

CHORUS:
There's others here with us
There's others here with us, I know

It's strange how your mind works when Love is in power
One learns 2 care and appreciate a flower
What makes others want 2 change your mind?
All the things I've seen, life is so sublime

CHORUS

7-month-old baby died in her sleep
The parents went crazy and cried 4 a week
They swore they heard her laugh in the crib by the wall
They're convinced she's with us if she's anything at all
There's others here with us
There's others here with us, I know (I know)

Bobby had an uncle who took a string
And wrapped his neck around it, a pitiful thing
If only we can turn back the hands of time
Except there's others here with us, life is sublime

There's others here with us
There's others here with us, I know (I know)

All the things I've seen {x2}

CHORUS
Ah...
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue
Some may say you don't play, you have a heart that's true
But how can they believe what you say, you only make me blue

You hurt me and you fool around
You don't even give me a chance
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance

Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue
Ah...

You hurt me and you fool around
You don't even give me a chance
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance

Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue
Ah...
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can

Just try, take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement to someone who's lost the way
Just try, or would I be talking to a stone, if I asked you
To share a problem that's not your own, oh, no
We can change things, if we start giving

Why don't you, reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can

Just try, if you see an old friend on the street
And he's down, remember his shoes could fit your feet
Just try, try a little kindness you'll see
It's something that comes very naturally, oh, yeah
We can change things, if we start giving
Why don't you?
(Why don't you?)
Reach out and touch somebody's hand

Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can

Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place, if you can
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Blue lace, her gown was blue lace
She wore the promise of springtime and laughter
Daybreak, we talked till daybreak
Without a warning of what might come after
Her touch was velvet, I still can feel it
That one brief moment that ended in space
Sometime in mid-December
I hear the music, the echo of springtime laughter
All day I see the old days
When I'd seen the young girls in blue, blue lace
Her gown was blue lace, such lovely blue lace
Her gown was blue
Baila mi rumba
Batela, goza y mira mama
Baila, mira mama
Batela, goza, mira eh
Rumbando bello es que yo voy
Bailala bailala bailala
Bailala baila baila
Eh eh mama

[??????]
Baila baila my rumbo

[?]
Ele eh ele eh
Bailala bailala baila
Din din baragadin dan dan 

[this is onomatopoeia]
Baila baila baila baila
Venezolano en Nueva York
En California y en todos lados
Te la traigo
Para que vos...para que gozes gozes cosa buena
Gozes con todo el mundo
El africano y todo el mundo
Bailala
Bailala
Bailala
Bailala
Bailala
Gringos!
Izquierdo! Izquierdo! Vamos, oye!

[onomatopoeic sounds, interjections, sighs, whistling, bits of dialogue among the musicians that sound like instructions or encouragement to keep on playing and dancing]
Me voy
Me voy
Me voy
Me voy
Me voy
Me voy
Me voy
Me voy

[More chanting and onomatopoeia]

[Translation:]
Dance to my rumba
Beat it 

[maybe a drum?], enjoy, look mama 

[maybe meaning "look at me and learn the steps."]
Dance, look mama
Beat it, enjoy, look
Dancing the rumba beautifully. That's how I go
Hey hey mama
Dance to it, dance
Dance
Dance this way 

[This a tentative translation, the expression I hear is actually unidiomatic]
Dance to it, dance
A Venezuelan in New York 

[maybe referring to himself]
In California and everywhere
I bring it to you 

[the rumba]
So that you will enjoy a good thing
Enjoy it with the rest of the world
With the African and the rest of the world
Dance to it
Gringos! 

[This is funny. "Gringo" is a pejorative way that some South Americans have to refer to Anglo-Saxons. It's clear that some North Americans are actually dancing to the music in]

Before we say good-bye forever
Come waltz with me, come waltz with me - once more
Before we let love die forever
Come waltz with me, the way we waltzed - before

Before our little world, just crumbled and fell
And tumbled, like a house of cards - to the floor

Before I'm left to sigh forever
And haunt the past - give me this last - encore
Oh darling come and waltz with me - once more
Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new

It's very subtle, the Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance

It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, ooh, it's continental

You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental
You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you

You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time

Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm

Trouble in mind, babe, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
Yes, the sun gonna shine
In my back door someday

I'm goin' down, down to the river
I'm gonna take my rockin' chair
Lord, if the blues overtake me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

'Cause I'm trouble in mind, you know that I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
Yes, the sun gonna shine
In my back door someday

I'm gonna lay, lay my head
On some sad, old railroad iron
I'm gonna let that 2:19
Pacify my mind

I'm trouble in mind, baby you know that I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
Yes, the sun gonna shine
In my back door someday
I got dosed by you (and)
Closer than most to you (and)
What am I s'posed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

In you a star is born (and)
You cut a perfect form (and)
Someone forever warm
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

Show love with no remorse (and)
Climb onto your sea horse (and)
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on
Lay on Lay on Lay on Lay on
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

I got dosed by you (and)
Closer than most to you (and)
What am I s'posed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be ok

Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America!
Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences

[Chorus]
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me

[Repeat: x3]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay

[Spoken Intro]
I don't wanna say goodbye

[Verse]
There are some who believe that I owe them something
But they're wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself
And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there, I am to blame

[Refrain]
Up
Down, up, up, up
Down, up, up, up
Down, up, up, up
Up
Down, up, up, up
Down, up, up, up
Down, up, up, up
I might be late tonight
But I guess everything is alright
I know it ain't like me
But there's something you see
That I just can't put right
Maybe a dream last night
That I can't understand

For all I know I love you so
Somethings got a hold of me
And I've got to make you see
That things aren't the same

Could be that yesterday
As I was walking on my way
Some face out of my past
Just happened to cast a shadow on me
Oh that made me see
That I've been all wrong

You know I could have sworn
It was someone I loved before
Someone I used to linger on
Something I just couldn't put my finger on
Just a face and a memory
That stood between you and me
Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh baby
Oooh child I've got to tell you now
That there is someone else in my life

Got to make you know that
Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh baby baby baby
Oh child oh little girl
There is someone else in my life
And its breaking my heart

Its mighty late tonight
But I feel I gotta get it right
This face I've been dreaming of
Well it is the face of a long lost love
And as I look into your eyes
Suddenly I realize
That that someone else is you
Oh I've been such a fool baby
Baby baby baby baby

Oh child got to make you know
That you're the someone else in my life
And I've been such a lonely man
But now I've found my baby
Oh Oh and I wanna make you know girl
That I've finally found someone else
That someone is you
Oh

[Verse 1]
It was a Zombie Jamboree
Took place in a New York cemetery
It was a Zombie Jamboree
Took place in a New York cemetery
Zombies from all parts of the Island
Some of them was a great Calypsonians
Although the season was Carnival
We get together in bacchanal
And they singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
I don't give a damn, I done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree
I hear ya talkin'
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree

[Verse 2]
One female Zombie wouldn't behave
See how she jumping out of the grave
In one hand a quarter rum
In the other hand she knocking Congo drum
Believe singer start to make his rhyme
The Zombies are racking their bones in thyme
One bystander had this to say
It was a pleasure to see the Zombies break away
And they're singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree, oh

[Verse 3]
I goin' talk to Miss Brigit Bardot
And tell her "Miss Bardot take it slow"
All the men think they're Casanova
When they see that she's bare foot all over
Even old men out into beaker
Find their hearts getting weaker and weaker
So I goin' to ask her for your sake and mine
At least to wear her earrings part at the time
And I'm singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree, oh

[Verse 4]
A lot of world leaders talkin' 'bout war
And I'm afraid they're going too far
So it's up to us, you and me
To put an end to catastrophe
We must appeal to their goodness of heart
And ask them to pitch in and please do their part
'Cause if this atomic war begin
They won't even have a part to pitch in
And we'll be singing

[Chorus]
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie Jamboree
I hear ya talkin'
Back to back, belly to belly
Don't give a damn, done dead already
Uh-oh, back to back, belly to belly
At the Zombie, Zombie Jamboree
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)

Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means
The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture
Just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing
The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally
The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time
Oh when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love will keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
It's what makes honey taste sweet
It's what makes your life complete
There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day

At the senior prom
We danced 'til three
And there you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day

Take it away
Take five

Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone

When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day
We'll remember always
Graduation (day) day

[Verse 1]
Every week's the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8AM's crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool

[Pre-Chorus]
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go, oh-oh (Go, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Hanging out's just something we like to do
My friends and the mess we get into
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use

[Pre-Chorus]
The day's too long
Yeah, I'm holding on
'Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's time when we're gonna
(Time when we're gonna)

Feels so good to let go, oh-oh (Go, oh-oh)

[Bridge]
Wish it would never end
Spending time with my friends
Oh, with my friends!

[Chorus]
Breakout
Let the party start
We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart
Uh-oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
Feels so good to let go
Breakout

Well I hate to see the sun sets in the West
'Cos I know my whole life gonna be a solid mess
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

Well, I walked this town from door to door
Gal I love can't find no more
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye

Well I've looked all around trying to find me a wife
I got to find my big legged brownskin share the rest of my life
I got to find my baby I declare well I
I ain't had no real good lovin' since my gal said goodbye
Oh, if I had three wishes
My first would be for you
And if you became my love
I'd return the other two

Oh, if I had three wishes
I'd ask for you alone
All the other things I want
Will be mine when you're my own

But if you told me
That I must use the other two
It wouldn't matter, dear
'Cause here's what I would do

If I had those three wishes
My first would be for you
And the second and the third would be
That my first wish comes true

But if you told me
That I must use the other two
It wouldn't matter, dear
'Cause here's what I would do
If I had those three wishes
My first would be for you
And the second and the third would be
That my first wish comes true

[Verse 1]
Baby, when there's only one embrace
One is just enough for two
When do I learn, young fingers get burned
Never my love (hahaa...)

[Verse 2]
And when everyone has been a friend
Windy day we never knew
Now nothing can stand the way it was planned
No, baby nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

[Chorus]
Even though you're far away
Your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Ha... ha... (never)
No... (never)

[Verse 3]
And when every cloud has lost its glow
Raining on my avenue
When do I hide that nothing inside
When baby nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

[Chorus]
Even though you're far away
Your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Ha... ohh, never (never)
Oh... (never)

[Verse 4]
And when everyone has gone away
Sing to the Almighty if it's what you need to feel (do)
The world is real (true)
And baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

[Outro]
Ha...
Loving you
Loving you
Love
I'll be loving you, love...
(Dead like Elvis) {sample repeated in song}
Check, check, 1 2, check
U know what he's sayin'?

Face down! {x2}

Somebody once told him that he wouldn't take Prince through the ringer
Let him go down as a washed up singer
Ain't that a bitch?
Thinkin' all along that he wanted 2 be rich
Never respected the root of all evil and he still don't 2 this day, huh
Bury him face down, let the motherfuckers kiss a ass, OK?

Face down! {x2}

Told 'em he wanted 2 sing a song about a black child goin' buck wild
And they just laughed in his face
Talk 2 your lawyer but U got no case
What U need 2 do is keep your place
Next time U pull a card, it better be a ace motherfucker
Or U can lay face down (Face down!)
1 2
Face down! 1 2

Horn {x2}
Bass {x2}

Him and her meaning who I'm singin' about
And his psychoanalyst kinda saw the catalyst
As the devil with the blue jeans on, huh
Ain't it kinda funny when U see the dawn?
Sign the name they gave ya
But when them motherfuckers turn around ass up, U're what?

Face down! 1 2
Face down! New Power Generation in the house, bury 'em all
Face down! Yes, oh Lord
Face down!

Orchestra {x3}
Face down!
Orchestra
Face down!

It's in his will, I read it
He shot 2 kill, he said it
4 those who know the number and don't call
Hmph, fuck all y'all
Face down! {x3}

[Intro: Spoken]
This is a new day
Let’s change the game
Look beyond the surface
Open up your heart, your mind and soul
It’s time to erase the line ethic, gender, color
No suppression, no boundaries, no limits, just music
Forget what you think you know about me

[Verse 1: Nate]
Just imagine life without love
It would be like tears with no pain
Would be such a shame
Cause I, I can see it in your eyes
You want something to make you feel alive
And that’s what we provide, no...

[Chorus:]
Just you wait and see
I’ll make you believe
We can make this dream a reality
Let’s make a brand new day
Change is on the way
We gon’ be ok if we just believe

It ain’t about what you know
Some 'bout lettin' go
Of everything you thought this world should be
We imaginate, it’s never too late
We can change the fate of what will be

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know that it ain’t about color
No stereotypical agenda
Time to create a new world order
And with love we'll part the waters oh
No boundaries, the sky is the limit
That’s the way that it was in the beginning
Open your heart and let love in it
If we do we'll all be winning, oh...

[Chorus:]
Just you wait and see
I’ll make you believe
We can make this dream a reality
Let’s make a brand new day
Change is on the way
We gon’ be ok if we just believe

I’ll make you believe
We can make this dream a reality
Let’s make a brand new day
Change is on the way
We gon’ be ok if we just believe

[Bridge: Shawn]
Believe in yourself, if it’s not enough
Believe in the music, it will help you
Change the life you’re living
And take the words I'm giving
If you receive then I know you can believe

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know that it ain't about color
No stereotypical agenda
Time to create a new world order
And with love we'll part the waters, oh

[Chorus:]
Just you wait and see
I’ll make you believe
We can make this dream a reality

Let’s make a brand new day
Change is on the way
We gon’ be ok if we just believe

[Verse]
Hey baby, what'cha know good?
I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start gettin' together again?
Are things really gettin' better, like the newspaper said?
What else is new, my friend, besides what I read?
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening?
What's happening, brother? Woo
(Everything is everything)
Are they still gettin' down where we used to go and dance?
Will our ball club win the pennant?
Do you think they have a chance?
And tell me, friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me what's out and I wanna know what's in
What's the deal, man, what's happening?
What's happening, brother?
What's happening, brother?
Ah, what's happening, brother?
What's happening, my man? Woo
Ah, what's happening brother?
Say man, woo, what's happening, brother?
What's been shakin' up and down the line?
I wanna know 'cause I'm slightly behind the time
Woo hoo ooh hoo

[Verse 1]
I can see the colors of the rainbow
And I can feel the sun on my face
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And I can feel heaven in its place

[Chorus 1]
And that's the sign of a victory
And that's the sign of a victory

[Verse 2]
I can feel the spirit of the nations
And I can feel my wings ridin' the winds, yeah
I see the finish line just up ahead na
And I can feel it risin' deep within

[Chorus 1]
And thats the sign of a victory
And thats the sign of a victory

[Verse 3]
Now I can the distance of the journey
High and front with all your might
You open your eyes to global warming
Been through it all, you sacrificed your life

[Chorus 1]
And that's the sign of a victory
And that's the sign of a victory

[Bridge]
If we believe, we can achieve anything
Including the impossible this I know
So lets lift up our heads and
Raise the flag yeah yeah and
Scream like you want to win
Now let the games begin!

[Chorus 2]
That's the sign of a victory
That's the sign of a victory
That's the sign of a victory
That's the sign of a victory

When you keep on fightin' , after you lost your strength
That's the sign of a victory
When darkness is all around you, you still find your way
Thats the sign of a victory
Come on and sing, lift up your voice and sing, stand up, oh yeah, stand up

Sign of a victory
Ooooohh ohh ohhhh
The other day they waited
The sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated
"He has to die
You know he has to die"

And all the children learning
From books that they were burning
Every leaf was turning
To watch him die
You know he has to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
But it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die
Spanish lady come to me
She lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round
It trembles and explodes

It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away
But the heat came ‘round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)

Escaping through the lily fields
I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded
Left a bus stop in its place

The bus came by and I got on
That's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel
Of a bus to never-ever land

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die

He had to die
You know he had to die

He had to die
Well, you know he had to die
Verse 1:
Every day that goes by
Every moment you'll find
There's a broken heart
A tear is cried
A wish is made
That never comes true
And somewhere someone needs to be found

Chorus:
The things we do, the things we say
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day
The things we do, the things we say
These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away
The things we do

Verse 2:
Every day in this life
Every moment you'll find
A heart is healed
A dream is found
A tear is dried
And laughter is heard
And somehow someone's life will be changed by
Chorus:
The things we do, the things we say
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day
The things we do, the things we say
These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away
The things we do

Bridge:
Oh every hand that has been held
Has reached out for somebody else
In every move we make
Every day
We pass love on this way
Chorus
I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so
I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know
I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon it's over
And done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so
I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises
She'll never keep
And soon it's over
And done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so
What about the one who said he loved you?
What about the one who said he cared?
Don't bother trying to find him
Way up in the icy air

Oh, you played with his heartstrings
And you played without a care
But not up in the High Sierra
You won't play his heart out there

The angels lay their clouds across his sky
They line up for him every night
Some have wings and others sing
The rest do lazy ballets in the air

There he's got a bird to give him warning
And he's gotta lookout too
The beauty of the High Sierra
And she's looking out for you

The angels lay their clouds across his sky
They line up for him every night
Some have wings and others sing
The rest do lazy ballets in the air
What about the one who said he loved you?
What about the one who said he cared?
He's up in the High Sierra
But don't bother looking there
Feeling out, feeling down:
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then up came-a one that said (hey, Dread):
"Hey, Dread, fly, Natty Dread, and smile!"
You're in Jamaica: C'mon and smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, y'all!
(In Jamaica) Get it together, now!
In Jamaica, y'all
Soulful town, soulful people:
Said, I see you're having fun
Dancin' to the reggae rhythm
Oh, island in the sun:
Oh, smile!
(In Jamaica) C'mon and smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, right now!
(In Jamaica) Get it together, children!
(In Jamaica, y'all)
We're gonna help our people, help them right;
Oh, Lord, help us tonight!
Cast away that evil spell;
Throw some water in the well
And smile!
(In Jamaica) C'mon and smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get things together, right now!
(In Jamaica) Get it together, right now!
(In Jamaica, y'all)
Riddim wise (wise)
Dub-a wise (wise)
And other wise (wise)
Can't criticize (-cize) our smile
(In Jamaica) You're gonna smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, right now!
(In Jamaica) Get things together, right yow!
(In Jamaica, y'all)
Help my people, help them right!
O Lord, help us tonight!
Cast away evil spell;
Throw some water in the well
And smile!
(In Jamaica) You're gonna smile!
(In Jamaica, y'all) Get it together, children!
(In Jamaica) Get things together, right yow!
(In Jamaica, y'all)
Soulful town, soulful people
Said, I know, I know that you're having fun!
Just this morning
I took a big long look around
I've lived it up and loved it up
And done it in this town
Life goes on
Look like it's time
For moving on

Good-bye, baby
I wanna thank you for the ride
We did a dance and took a chance
Nothing we ain't tried
C'est la vie
Time, you and me
Moving on

I'm moving on
I'll see you somewhere down the line
I'm moving on
We're looking good and feeling fine
I'm moving on
And you are yours and I'm mine
I'll see you somewhere in my dreams
I'm moving on
So thanks for all the memories
I'm moving on
And you can call me Mr. Breeze
I'm moving on
Life is full of mysteries
Nothing is ever what it seems
Might try Vegas
And keep on playing till I win
Or take it out to Hollywood
And fall in love again
Come what may
Night and day
I'm moving on

I'm moving on

I'm moving on
I'll see you somewhere down the line
I'm moving on
We're looking good and feeling fine
I'm moving on
And you are yours and I'm mine
I'll see you somewhere in my dreams
I'm moving on
So thanks for all the memories
I'm moving on
And you can call me Mr. Breeze
I'm moving on
Life is full of mysteries
Nothing is ever what it seems
If you would let me love you, baby
There is nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you
Yes if you would let me love you, baby
Ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you
I would even try to walk on water, woman
If you would just say
"Baby I love you too"

If you let me love you, baby
I'll buy you a car made of gold
I'll even give you a fountain of youth, baby
So you will never grow old
Just let me love you, woman

Ain't nothing I wouldn't do in this world
I want you to call me your boy, woman
Baby, and I'm gonna call you my girl

Yeah, I'l lhire you a teacher, baby
To read you storybooks
I'll make you a talkin' mirror, woman
Just to tell you how good you look
Ain't nothing I wouldn't do in this world
I want you to call me your boy, woman
Baby, and I'm gonna call you my girl

Yes, I'm gonna fall on my knees
Would even call the Lord
Just to seed the dimple, baby
In your cheeks when you smile

Let me love you
Ain't nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you
I say I would try to walk the water, baby
If you say that you love me too
I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through

In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees
The wishing well

And I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
And everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

[Intro]
Dog eat dog

[Verse 1]
It's dog eat dog
I'm just waking up
The dove is in the dungeon
And the white-washed hawks peddle hate and call it love

[Verse 2]
Dog eat dog
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big wig financiers

[Verse 3]
Dog eat dog
On primetime crime the victim begs
Money is the road to justice
And power walks it on crooked legs

[Verse 4]
Primetime crime
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big wig financiers

[Chorus 1]
Where the wealth's displayed, thieves and sycophants parade
And where it's made, the slaves will be taken
Some are treated well in these games of buy and sell
And some, like poor beasts, are burdened down to breaking

[Verse 5]
Dog eat dog
It's dog eat dog, ain't it, flim-flam man?
Dog eat dog, you can lie, cheat, skim, scam
Beat 'em any way you can

[Verse 6]
Dog eat dog
You'll do well in this land of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
You could get to be a big wig financier

[Chorus 2]
Land of snap decisions, land of short attention spans
Nothing is savored long enough to really understand
In every culture in decline, the watchful ones among the slaves
Know all that is genuine will be scorned and conned and cast away

[Outro]
Dog eat dog
People looking, seeing nothing
Dog eat dog
People listening, hearing nothing
Dog eat dog
People lusting, loving nothing
Dog eat dog
People stroking, touching nothing
Dog eat dog
Knowing nothing
Dog eat dog
You're trying to tell me you're saying goodbye
I'm watching you leaving not believing my eyes
You'd better be looking over your shoulder
Cause I know too much for this to be over
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it
What once was good is gone like innocence we watched it dying
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it, can't hide it
Let it go...
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it, let it go...
I always hoped that this would last forever
Just you and me against the world
What once was powerful has weakened now we can't pretend
What once was right is wrong like everything this game must end
Oh baby, the lies and deception
We're gonna bring each other down
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it
Let it go (let it go)
I told you all (let it go)
I told you all (let it go)
I told you, told you, let it go
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
Can't believe that you don't love me
Thought our love was here to stay

Now buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
When I say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all
Yes, buzz me, baby
I'm like the ship that's lost at sea
Buzz me, buzz me, baby
You mean so much to me
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973

[Intro]
Love songs used to be so beautiful
"Let us go then, you and I
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table."
- T.S. Eliot
Nowadays, thanks to corporately-owned pop stars. Love songs are even more beautiful. How beautiful are today's love songs?
I'll show you

[Verse 1]
I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it
I love your heart, and you're so smart, 'cause you gave away it
I love your sis, I love your dad, I love your mum
But more than all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough
(Swag!)
To not realize everything I've said has been said before
In a thousand ways, in a thousand songs
Sung with the same four chords
But you'll still love it and let me finger you
(Finger you?)
Yeah, finger you!
FINGER YOU!

[Hook 1]
Oh girl, I hope you don't think that I'm rude
When I tell you that I love you, boo
I also hope that you don't see through
This cleverly constructed ruse
Designed by a marketing team
Cashing in on puberty and low self esteem
(So low!)
And girls' desperate need to feel loved
(Love! Love, love, love, love)
(Please love me!)

[Pre-Chorus]
America says we love a chorus
But don't get complicated and bore us
Though meaning might be missin'
We need to know the words after just one listen, so

[Chorus]
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, yeah
(Repeat stuff! Yeah, repeat stuff!)

[Verse 2]
I love my baby and you know I couldn't live without her
But now I need to make every girl think this song's about her
Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague
So I describe my dream girl as really, really vague like
I love your hands, 'cause your fingerprints are like no other
I love your eyes and their blueish, brownish, greenish color
I love it when you smile, that you smile wide
And I love how your torso has an arm on either side, now
If you're my agent, you might be thinking
"Oh no, sound the alarms!
You're not appealing
To little girls who don't have arms"
But they can't use iTunes, so
Fuck 'em, who needs 'em?

[Hook 1]
Oh girl, I hope you don't think that I'm rude (I am a servant of darkness)
When I tell you that I love you, boo (I am the Void)
I also hope that you don't see through (The rivers shall run red with the blood of virgins)
This cleverly constructed ruse
Designed by a marketing team (I take many shapes)
Cashing in on puberty and low self esteem (This is one of them)
(The strong will be made weak)
And girls' desperate need to feel loved (And the weak shall bow before me)
(SWAG!)

[Pre-Chorus]
America says we love a chorus
But don't get complicated and bore us
Though meaning might be missin'
We need to know the words after just one listen, so

[Chorus]
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
(Repeat stuff for me, stuff!)
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
(Stuff, gay, gay stuff)
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, yeah
(Yes! Repeat it! Repeat it till the day you die!)

[Bridge]
I'm in magazines full of model teens
So far above you
So read them and hate yourself
Then pay me to tell you, "I love you"
(I love you)
And your parents will always come along
Because their little girl is in love
And how could love be wrong?
How could love be wrong?

[Chorus]
When you repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
(Unh, yeah, fuck, fucking repeat it again)
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
(Repeat it again, yeah, keep repeating it)
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff

[Excerpt from Adolf Hitler's speech at the Nuremberg Rally]
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff

[Giggling]
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, repeat stuff, repeat stuff
Repeat stuff, yeah

[Outro]
We know it's not right
We know it's not funny
But we'll stop beating this dead horse
When it stops spittin' out money
But until then, we will repeat stuff
O give me a home where the buffaloes roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Where the air is so pure and the zephyrs so free
And the breezes so balmy and light
That I would not exchange my home on the range
For all of the cities so bright

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

How often at night when the heavens are bright
With the light of the glittering stars
I stand there amazed & I ask as I gaze
Does their glory exceed that of ours?
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
I hate to see your broken face
This world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to
I hate your state of hopelessness
And that vain articulateness
Your loser type wreck wanna be
Not a pretty sight really in another world it'd be funny
I hate to see your broken face, a lazy life of fatal waste
If fashionable cynicism, the poison they want you to drink
Oh no man, that's too easy
Oh no man, that's too easy
We weren't talking 'bout happiness, apply your leading potential
To be useful to this planet, the world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to
I hate to see your broken face, a lazy life of fatal waste
If fashionable cynicism, the poison they want you to drink
Oh no man, that's too easy
Oh no man, that's too easy
We weren't talking 'bout happiness, apply your leading potential
To be useful to this planet, the world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to

[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
It's someone else
I've known it all the time
Known that you're not mine
And will never be

It's someone else
I saw you out last night
Holding him so tight
And it's someone else

No, I really can't hate him
For what's happening to me
Will happen to him -
That's a certainty

And he'll learn
There's always someone else
Like I learned myself
Always someone else
Always someone else
BLUE SKIES
Writer(s): Irving Berlin

Blue skies, smilin' at me
Nothin' but blues skies do I see

Bluebirds singing a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticin' the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
Oo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Now the puzzle's laid out on my table
The pieces don't fit
I move from chair to chair
But that empty one's there where she used to sit

I'm sitting here going out of my mind
'Cause she's gone away
She couldn't wait, now I
I'm afraid it's too late

I'm waitin' till my angel comes home
It's been hell bein' here alone
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Angel, angel come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Oo oo oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home

Does she remember
That I can't forget
Does she know I regret
I never told her how I
I wanted to hold her
I just let her go
Lonely nights thinkin'
It's starting to sink in
We had a way to go
We'll grow closer together
By being apart

When my angel comes home
It's been hell bein' here alone
God tell me, why has she flown
So far away
I pray she won't stay another day
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Please come home

Angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Hoo ooo angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey hey angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Ho oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
If you see that girl my angel come home
Hey hey angel come home
Oh Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, Oh night
Oh Holy night
Fall on your knees, Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, Oh night
Oh Holy night
If you hear a politician
Or a singer making song
Do you just refuse to listen
Knowing that he must be wrong

That's the way it is, you know
You just see what you want to see
Who am I to tell you how to think
Or tell you who to be

I will show you what I know
Sometimes we will disagree
If we learn at all to grow
Then I have done my small duty

That's the way it is, you know
You just see what you want to see
Who am I to tell you how to think
Or tell you who to be

I could bring my favorite flower
Maybe yours would be the same
Maybe we would argue hours
Over the fair flower's name
That's the way it is, you know
You just see what you want to see
Who am I to tell you how to think
Or tell you who to be

If I brought my good friends home
And set a welcome table place
Could you see them past their clothing
Or past the color of their face

That's the way it is, you know
You just see what you want to see
Who am I to tell you how to think
Or tell you who to be

That's the way it is, you know
You just see what you want to see
Who am I to tell you how to think
My eyes are dry, my love, since you've been gone, I haven't shed a tear
I'll never cry, my love, though every day seems like a hundred years
For I'm just a fool who clings to his pride but when I'm alone
I can hear the sound of rain in my heart, of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside
I can't get away from the sound of the rain in my heart
How could I know, my love, I was a toy, only a game to you?
How could you go, my love, without a thought of what I'm going through?
How can I forget I still love you so, it echoes each time that I hear
The sound of rain in my heart from the tears that I hide
So it tears me apart, I still keep them inside
But I can't escape from the sound of the rain in my heart
I hear that rain in my heart of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside...
Walk little walk
Small talk big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That street two streets I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings
'Count high low don't worry my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe two gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm going to kick until I need new shoes
Yeah, yeah I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me, stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things
I run they run everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride boat ride piggy back ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride
One two three close your eyes and count to four
I gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayon on the walls
Color on the wall
I'll draw until I've broken every law
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop don't stop don't stop
Talking with me, stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things, stop don't stop don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop don't stop don't stop I said
Stop don't stop don't stop I said
Stop don't stop don't stop
Stop don't stop don't stop
Stop don't stop don't stop me
Wooden Planes
Propeller's spinning in the
West Texas wind
We ran behind
You know we laughed, we thought
Our little flight would never end
You were my brother and I
I knew you were my friend
I wish we
Were chasing after wooden
Airplanes....once again

The road's been long
You know I've done some good, and
Yes, I guess I've done some bad
I've sung my song
You know sometimes I swear I think
I've gone completely mad

If the story of my life ever makes
You sad
Remember when
We were a chasing after wooden
Airplanes
Yes, I believe that was the finest time
I jumped off a boxcar down around Tennessee
I was cold tired and dirty hungry as I could be
But I had my guitar and a hundred railroad songs
So I asked the policeman
Can I stay here long
He said Mr. Hobo you got to go now
We don't want you around
See I'm trying to build a respectable town
And we don't need a hobo like you hanging around

So I left that town, Lord with my guitar in my hand
Still cold and tired, kinda mad at the man
But this life that I chose to live, sometime's strange
See I'm trying to learn about the old music from ridin' the train
I'm a hobo I know, but thta's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away

I'm goin' to ride this train Lord until I find out
What Jimmie Rogers and the Hag was all about
See I play this rock n roll and I think that's fine
But I wnta to go back a little further in time
I'm a hobo I know but that's the price I pay
Guess I'll write me another song while I'm on my way
Catch me another train and this is what I'll say
Mr Choo-choo train take me away
She wants a place in heaven
But she cannot face the truth
She lives on a rope of self-pity
It only requires a noose

Why are the ones so afraid to live
Much more afraid to die?
It's as easy to imagine laughing

When you really hear a cry
And they sound the same
In hell, they sound the same
You want a place in heaven

Maybe you're already there
Life's what you make it, stop whining baby
Love comes to those who care

There must be children in heaven
Ones who know nothing from hate
Three year-old leaders of all colors
I'd feel safer with them in control, control, control, control
Three year-olds in control
We all want a place in heaven
Suites of that level are few
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service
It's all up to me and you
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service
It's all up to me and you
I was standing on the corner, wondering what's become of me
I was standing on the corner, wondering what's become of me
Well things don't seem to be the way they used to seem to be

I think I'll go up on a mountain, I'll fling myself off into space
I think I'll go up on a mountain, I'll fling myself off into space
I'm not doing it because I'm desperate, I'm just trying to save some space

If you ask me what my name is, I'll just stop and scratch my head
If you ask me what my name is, I'll just stop and scratch my head
Well they took away my name and gave me a number instead

Well all the things I used to know seem so far behind
There's a lot of new things that are running around my mind

If you ask me what I'm doing, I can't answer right
If you ask me what I'm doing, I can't answer right
Seems like nothin' ever changes, and nothing's gonna turn out right
A child was born in the east one day
Moved to the west coast after his parents passed away
Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats
In poetry, he was considered elite
Became a young gangster in the streets of L. A
Lost connections with his true roots far away
But no matter the job or crime
He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme
New Yorks hip hop movement broke loose
D. J's cut records, raps had the juice
Since busting rhymes was his natural thing
He was crowned the west coast M. C. King
But after his inauguration there was a rush
Of wack rappers with one intention to crush
This master rapper and take his throne
A simple job, he had no crew, he stood all alone
Assassins came in groups of one through five
With raps no mortal M. C. Could survive
But he shoved no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty
Battlin' from Friday on through to Thursday
Never losing a bout, never ending in doubt
Every confrontation K. O. Knock out!
On his never ending journey to the T-O-P
The L. A player, M. C. Ice-T
The firmament of Tinsel Town
Is strung with tungsten stars
Lot's of forty watt successes
He says where's my own shining hour
He's the well kept secret of the underground
He's in debt to the company store
Because his only channelled aspiration
Was getting back that girl he had before
He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme
Describing what it is to lose
He's got some just for laughs
He's got some for love
That mainline to his blues
Some to shed a little light on you and on me
Some to shed a little light on the human story

The wars of pride and property
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view
Brave reporters bring the battles home
But tonight inside that box
Just more bang bang ketchup color to him
Just more Twentieth Century Fox
All because that ghostly girl comes haunting
Just out of reach-outside his bed
And she kicks the covers off his sleep
For the clumsy things he said
She commands his head-She tries his sanity
She demands his head-Tonight unknowingly
Vaguely she floats and lacelike
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind
She's nebulous and naked
He wonders where she's been
He grabs at the air because there's nothing there
Her evasiveness stings him
With long legs-long lonely legs
Bruised from banging into things
One day he was standing just outside her door
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons
She just laughed
She said she heard him knocking
And she teased him for the moon
"Is one the moon, dear clown
Tied to a string for me?"
He tried but he could not get it down
For truth or for mystery
He tried but he could not get it down
For love or money
Prince

Carmen On Top
7.3 seconds 2 funkdown and counting
6..5.. I can't wait! Cut it!
Yeah
(Carmen, Carmen on top) {x4}
I have got a bone 2 pick - Why?
Cuz I'm sick of living in the slowest lane
I am what U call a hip-roarin' dame (U tell 'em baby!)
Let me tell U, say I am convinced without a guess
The possibility of a game in a previous life
In other words I've been here before
That's why when I party I kick down every door, every door
Nothing is ridiculous, so when the funk is sticking 2 the floor (What?)
In other words, the music's what I party 4 (This is your house, Carmen)
And with a beat like this, how could U ever resist? (Ho!)
Jump into the skin and get into the real shit (Ah!)

CHORUS:
Carmen, Carmen on top (Please don't stop)
Carmen, Carmen on top (Please don't stop)

Ohio - Cincinnati Town
Cuz that's where I was born?
No, that's where I dropped down (Hospital table)
On hospital table, huh
Ready and able from the time they slapped my ass (Woo!)
2 my last high school class (But how funky do U wanna be?)
And destined 2 be funkier than any other just as fast (How fast?)
As he could go (Right)
The C is 4 the car, the M is 4 the men in my shows (Ho!)
This is a family affair
U better hold tight cuz the C is gettin' there

Bootsy from my hometown, I used 2 like 

[one dude]
(Y'all are crazy) {Bootsy sample}
And I said if I ever got the chance
I wanna make music, make the people dance like that
Another basement low
Thumpin' on the bottom while the Carmen's on the top of the flow
(Go! Go! Go! ...)
I'm wasting' every dame
Ain't never been a slimmie that could ever do quite the same (Mailman)
(Carmen, Carmen, Carmen...)

Stop!
Carmen, ha ha.. {repeat in loop}
In me, you see a man alone
Held by the habit of being on his own
A man who listens to the trembling of the trees
With sentimental ease

In me, you see a man alone
Behind the wall he's learned to call his home
A man who still goes walkin' in the rain
Expecting love again

A man not lonely except when the dark comes on
A man learning to live with mem'ries of midnights that fell apart at dawn

In me, you see a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems
Only other people's dreams

[instrumental-strings]

A man learning to live with memories of midnights that fell apart at dawn
In me, you see a man alone
Drinking up Sundays and spending them alone
A man who knows love is seldom what it seems
Just other people's dreams
See the cracks upon the wall
We do not know the meaning of it all
Ain't no fire to warm my feet
Ain't got a nickel for a bit to ear
We're not workin', we're not slavin'
Ain't worth a brain, 'cause we're not worth savin'
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle, in a pond are we
Second hand people

Ain't no mirror to comb my face
Just keep on going from place to place
Ain't got no lights above my head
Don't even bother to leave my bed
We're not livin' ,we're existin'
We're not movin' ,just resistin'
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle , in a pond are we
Second hand people , tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle ....
Blues stay away from me
Oh blues, why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
Oh true love was never meant for me
Seem somehow
We never can agree

Life is full of misery
Oh dreams are like memories
Bringing back
The love that it used to be

Tears, so many I can't see
Oh yes, don't mean a thing to me
Oh, don't go by
Still I can be free
Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't you let that boy
Tell you what to do
Girl you know he's only jiving
Trying to get next to you
Girl I said
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Girl you better save your lovin'
Save it for a rainy day
Girl you better listen to me
Listen to what I say
Girl I tell you now
Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Don't give your lovin'
Don't give it away
Good good lovin'
Don't give it away
Don't give your love
Don't give it away
Don't give you lovin'
Don't give it away
Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts
Nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights what do I see
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat out of hell
I get to eat her dust
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh
I'd never known anything that counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you
Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steals my heart

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart

Look at the cities
Look at the streets what do you see
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be
Suddenly hit by something they don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
I'd never seen anything to compare with your smile
I'd never seen anything that came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you know you won't let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Oooee baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
Hijack my heart
Love isn't just for the young
It's for all who may wish upon a star
Love isn't just for the young
For true love doesn't ask how old you are
Doesn't matter if you're twenty or ninety two
You only need a heart to share
Then of course you need someone who feels like you
And who answers every dream and prayer
Love isn't just for the young
Never fear, let the whole world know it's spring
For love isn't just for the young
And there's, oh, so much joy that it can bring
Yes, the gold may have turned to silver
But if you still have songs left unsung
Just remember that love is for everyone
Love isn't just for the young
(musical interlude)
But if you still have songs left unsung
Just remember that love is for everyone
Love isn't just for the young
Now when your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now the flower lady wants back what she has have lent you
And the smell of her roses does not remain
When all your children start to resent you
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have all died in battle or in vain
And you find yourself sick of all this repetition
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All throw down their bandannas and complain
Maybe you want somebody you don't have to speak to
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Out of the darkness you suddenly appeared
You smiled and I was taken by surprise
I guess I should have seen right through you
But the moon got in my eyes
I was so thrilled by the love you volunteered
I gave my heart without a compromise
I guess you don't remember, do you?
When the moon got in my eyes
I thought a kingdom was in sight
That I would have the right to claim
But with the morning's early light
I didn't have a dream to my name
You know the saying that all who love are blind;
It seems that ancient adage still applies
I guess I should have seen right through you
But the moon got in my eyes
Don't care when you go
How long you stay
Good time treatments
Bring you back someday
Oh but someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life any more

Ain't but one thing
Give me the blues
When I've worn a hole
In my last pair of shoes
Oh but someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life any more
At words poetic I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best
Instead of getting 'em off my chest
To let 'em rest - unexpressed
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you how great you are

You're the top! you're the collosseum
You're the top! you're the louvre museum
You're the melody from a symphony by strauss
You're a bendel bonnet
A shakespeare sonnet
You're mickey mouse!

You're the nile! you're the tow'r of pisa
You're the smile, on the mona lisa!
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop!
But if baby I'm the bottom
You're the top!
You're the top, you're mahatma gandhi
You're the top! you're napoleon brandy
You're the purple light, of a summer night in spain
You're the national gallery, you're garbo's salary
You're cellophane!

You're sublime, you're a turkey dinner
You're the time, of the derby winner
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop;
But if baby I'm by the bottom you're the top!

You're the top, you're a waldorf salad
You're the top, you're a berlin ballad
You're the nimble tread of the feet of fred astaire
You're an o'neal drama, you're whistler's mama, you're camembert

You're a rose, you're inferno's dante
You're the nose, on the great durante
I'm a masy leroux who's just about to stop
But if baby I'm the bottom
You're the top!
Oh, when the saints go marching in
Well, when the saints go marching in
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the saints go marching in

Well, when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the saints go marching in

Yeah, when the sun refuse to shine
When the sun refuse to shine
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the sun refuse to shine

Go, go go
Go, go go

Well, when the saints go marching in
Well, when the saints go marching in
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the saints go marching in
Look here, when the sun refuse to shine
When the sun refuse to shine
I wanna be, be in that number, number
When the sun refuse to shine

When the saints, the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the saints go marching in

[Intro]
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, everybody sing now
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
When my dad thought I had become of age
He said, "Son, you're getting to the Lovin' Stage"
I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"It's time you stopped being all alone
You've got to find a girl you can call your own"

[Chorus]
I said, "Not now, I'll tell you later
Not now, I'll tell you when
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
I met a little girl, fine as could be
I said, "There was a girl who was made for me"
I said, "Oh yeah, oh yeah"
I thought if I tried, I just couldn't miss
So I asked the little girl for just one kiss

[Chorus: The Supremes]
She said, "Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love"

[Bridge]
When it's time for you to fall in love
It don't make sense for you to hurry
Take your time and make up your mind
'Cause the surer you are, the less you have to worry

Do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do, hey

[Chorus]
Not now, I'll tell you later (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Not now)
Not now, I'll tell you later
When I'm gonna fall in love (Everybody sing it)
Not now, I'll tell you later (Everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you when (Everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you later (Everybody)
When I'm gonna fall in love (One more time, everybody)
Not now, I'll tell you later...

[Verse 1]
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone
After all these years
You still treat me wrong
Why do you wanna wear me down?
No, don't tear me down

[Chorus]
Girl, ain't I been good to you (So good)
Say, baby (So good)
Now, didn't I give it all to you (So good)
Hey, baby (So good)

[Verse 2]
I gave it all, baby, and I trusted you
Though there have been times you haven't been true
You don't have to hide from me
And ah, don't lie to me

[Chorus]
Girl, ain't I been good to you (So good)
Hey, baby (So good)
Didn't I run it all down to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)

[Verse 3]
I will go on, baby, loving you
Because you're all I am used to
I haven't the strength to fight
So don't you wanna do me right?

[Chorus]
Girl, ain't I, woo (So good)
Baby (So good)
Said ain't I been good to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)
Said that I've been, ow (So good)
Good to you, babe (So good)
Ain't I been good to you (So good)
Well, baby (So good)
Didn't I run it all down (So good)
All down to you (So good)
Ain't I been, ow (So good)
Good to you, baby (So good)
Said that I've been, ha (So good)
Good to you, baby (So good)
Yeah, I've been so good (So good)
To you, baby (So good)
Ha, gotta say I've been, oh (So good)
Good to you (So good)
I'm regretting (So good)
Yeah, baby (So good)
Said I've been, oh (So good)
Oh (So good)
Good to you (So good)
Say, baby (So good)

[Verse 4]
Well, one day you're here, baby, now
And then you're gone
After all these years
You still treat me wrong
Why do you wanna wear me down?
No, no, don't tear me down
Girl, and I've been so good
Oh, I've been so-oh good
Well, I gave my all, baby
And I trusted you, oh yes, I did
Though there have been times you've been untrue, baby
You don't have to hide from me
And no, don't lie to me
Said ain't I been good, baby

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 5]
I will go on, baby, loving you
Because you're all I'm used to
I haven't the strength to fight
Don't that make you wanna do me right?
Oh, oh, said I've been good, baby
Good, baby

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Why do you wanna wear me down?
Don't tear me down, baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Well, I've been good, baby, baby
Sho' nuff I've been good now, now, now
Don't wear me down
No, don't tear me down
I haven't got the strength to fight, woman
Why don't you do me right
I'll go on loving you
Girl, you're all I'm used to, baby
Ooh, ooh
The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden LAUGH that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo

[Verse 1]
Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday

[Verse 2]
Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
They're just trying to bribe me

[Chorus]
And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

[Verse 3]
Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me

[Outro]
I just think maybe I'm making a mistake

[Verse 1]
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

[Pre-Chorus]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say: "What have I got to lose?"

[Chorus]
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

[Pre-Chorus]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes, you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

[Interlude]
Little Red Corvette
Little Red Corvette

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey
Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down
(Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your Little Red Corvette right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground
(Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

[Breakdown]
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow!
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a limousine
Ow!

[Chorus]
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)
Babe, you got to slow down (you got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Little Red Corvette
Little Red Corvette, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah!

[Interlude]

[Outro]
There are some things you do to me
That leave me in a velvet sweat
Darling, there are some things that I want to do to you
So you'll never forget!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Music must be a lady
The way it makes me love to me
Me, you, music, music
I'm so amazed by your choice of melodies that you used on me
Lady music, when we make love it's like we're making love with the same key
Music must a lady cause of the way you sing your melody, woman, oh
Walk on by your sexual energy
Miss conduct all up orchestration means how to please you
In this room music I do for you

I hear a drum roll as we...
When you grace my stage I can't find the words to say...
Music must be, must be a woman
You're my anthem, you're the reason why I dance
Music, missis music, miss music, I wanna make your body sing some come joy and happiness

Write your words in my bed

Miss music, said I'll never fall in love, never ever fall in love
Now here I am in love, so so in love with you
Miss music, this love making is so unique
Come on let it break out over me like a quiet... beat
Music, said I celebrate you and I honored you and I salute you
And I sing my heart out to you
Music, cause you deserve it and I would like to do some things to you
Music, so get ready, miss music, get ready darling
Cause I'm about to add, I'm a need to your life
Love making do it, just to be precise baby
Music, hello sweet soprano, miss music
I want you to meet mister tenor
And I love your music, as a matter of fact I'm quite a big fan
Music, missis music, missed you, missis music, music
Oh, smokestack lightnin', shinin' just like gold
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo
Oh, stop your train, let a hobo ride
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo
Oh, fare you well, I never see you no more
Why can't you hear me cryin'? Ooooo
Oh, stop your train, let a poor boy ride, callin' yes I do
Let a poor boy ride, let his foot step on
Oh, who've been you baby, since I've been gone
I was wrong beyond belief
Even the blindest man could see
That the choices that I've made
Would be the end of you and me
So I sit here all alone
I've been a mess since you've been gone
Now I hate myself like no one else
I know that I'm at fault
Truth is there's really no excuse
For what I did or didn't do
So sorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to save

[Chorus:]
Save one more dance with me
One last second chance for me
Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
I swear I'll never break your heart again
Please don't let the music end
Could you just save me one more dance
One more dance, dance, one more dance, dance
Maybe I was just afraid
Of how good my life can be
So I messed things up and hurt you girl
Before you could hurt me
I'm not saying I was right
I'm not so proud of what I did
Well I'm not gonna lie, or try to justify
Or try to make it all make sense
Truth is there's really no excuse
For all I did or didn't do
So sorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to say

[Chorus:]
Save one more dance with me
One last second chance for me
Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
I swear I'll never break your heart again
Please don't let the music end
Would you just save me one more dance
One more dance, dance, one more dance, dance
If there's a space in your heart, please find the room to forgive
Let's try and make a new start, and begin
If you take the lead, I'll follow you
From this moment, I'll dance for you
Tell me I'm not dancing all alone, no

[Chorus:]
Save one more dance with me
One last second chance for me
Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
I swear I'll never break your heart again
Please don't let the music end
Could you just save me one more dance
One more dance, dance, one more dance, dance
You've got a plan that could never go wrong
You took advantage and the damage done
It all comes back to me baby
It all comes back to me

I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the die was cast
You know I had to be crazy
You know I had to be

I've been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand

I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesn't tell you
What you need me to say
But, I would die for you baby
Yes, I would die for you

I've been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand

I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
Ah,yes, I'm weary from battle
But I've just begun to fight
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide

I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
I'm just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
I'm just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
Ah, yes, I'm weary from battle
But I've just begun to fight
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide

I'm just the man in the middle
The only man
The fool of a man in the middle
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide

I'm just the man
The only man
That stupid man
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
Morning... (Morning)
Seems to come so slow
Knowing... (Knowing)
How I need this warming glow
Foolishly, I've made you cried
Confident, you never say goodbye
Darling, that's the reason why
That even in a crowd, laughing out loud, I'm lonely. (Lonely)
For I love you only. And without you
Every night's... just another lonely night
Falling. (Just another)
Tears are falling from my eyes
I'm calling (Just another)
Out your name, tearful sigh
How I pray it's not too late
All my life for you I wait
Just call me I won't hesitate
For when you left you took the best of me
I love you, can't you see?
Since you've been gone
Every night's... just another lonely night
(Just another)
Since you've been gone my life is so lonely, baby, baby
It's just-a (Just another)
Even my sun is hopeing
(Just another)
Oh, it's all I need is you only
Hmmm
(Just another)
I'm just no good without you, baby
I'm just-a lonely, lonely...
Christmas time comes but once a year
Oh I'm so happy
My kids are happy too

It's take the next six months to pay my bills
When I think about it folks it gives me chills
But I don't care cause Christmas comes but once a year

I'm gettin' ready people
To have myself a ball
Im going out partying
Gonna dance to every call
I'm gonna think about new years day
I don't care what i have to pay
Let the good times roll
Cause Christmas comes but once a year

[Verse]
Someday I'll find her
And I'm still reminded
Maybe she's best in dreams
She's still the best I've seen

[Hook]
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Dreamin'
Baby, I'm dreamin'

[Outro]
Out on her windowsill
You taught me how to bend and never break
You showed me how to give instead of take
There was no sacrifice too great with you
Sweet, sweet woman can't you see what you doin'
You made me a born, a born again human
Born again human

To took a broken man and you made him whole
You touched my lips and reached my very soul
There was no miracle you couldn't do
Sweet woman, can't you see what you doin'
You made me a born, born again human
A born again human

You're my religion now
My hope and faith
Through your love I rejoined the human race
Sweet, sweet woman, can't you see what you doin'
You made me a born, a born again human
Born again human
Born again human
When you loved me
I was walking on rainbows
Like nobody else has done
This will make you laugh
But darling I staked my dream on you, aww baby
This will make you laugh
They never did come true, they never did come true
I took a chance on young romance
And vowed it would not miss
But i never, never, never should have judged
A heart by a kiss
This is gonna make you laugh
But baby, i believed in you
For all my love, darling, you didn't see it through, boo-hoo
For all the fools, I break the rules
I love you, can't you see?
This will make you laugh
But it's not funny...
This shit ain't one bit funny to me
Everyone has had the blues at some time
And been used, I ain't lying
I've been used and abused
And I've got the blues, blues, blues
Over you

Everyone has had it hard at some time
People trying to find a peace of mind
I've been trying, I ain't lying
Trying to find a peace of mind
Over you

I lay every night
Thinking about my situation
I get the blues
Right off the bat
If we can just have
A decent conversation
You know that things
Wouldn't be so bad
Oh I was cheated, why I don't know
And mistreated by a no good so and so

I've been cheated and mistreated
And I've got the blues, blues, blues
Over you

I lay every night
Thinking about my situation
I get the blues
Right off the bat
If we can just have
A decent conversation
You know that things
Wouldn't be so bad

You've got to live and let live
When we were together
All you wanted for me was to give
Now I'm not giving, you're barely living
You're on your own
You're living all alone
Now we're through, me and you
And I don't have the blues, blues, blues
Over you

[Intro]
Whoo
Hoo, hoo
Star (ooh)
I'm wishing (ooh)
Wishing, wishing
On a star (ah)

[Verse 1]
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow, praying it never comes
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we've spent
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow (sow)

[Bridge]
I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together (Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never

[Verse 3]
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
I'm hoping all the days to come and days to go
I'm hoping on days of loving, loving you so

[Outro]
Baby, forgive me
Let's make up, I'm sorry
Let's be together
Break up, never
The love we have's been special so far
Till we get back, I'm wishing on (a star)
Home, come on home
Ye who are weary come home
Softly and tenderly calling
Home, come on home

Sometimes when I'm feeling lonesome
And no one on earth seems to care
I'm all by myself in the darkness
With no one and nothing to share

Just when it feels like it's hopeless
And I'll never make it alone
I hear the voices of angels
Tenderly calling me home

Home, come on home
Ye who are weary come home
Softly and tenderly calling
Home, come on home

I try to keep it together
I never let on that I'm scared
Still sometimes I fall to pieces
Scattered and lost everywhere
Just when it feels like there's no one
To mend all my broken down dreams
I hear a voice deep inside me
Tenderly calling to me

Home, come on home
Ye who are weary come home
Softly and tenderly calling
Home, come on home

So don't be afraid of the darkness
And don't run away from the storm
Stand up and face your reflection
The feelings you try to ignore

After the tempest is over
You've let yourself come on through
You'll hear a voice in the silence
Tenderly calling to you

Home, come on home
Ye who are weary come home
Softly and tenderly calling
Home, come on home
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair(she's so sexy)
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

(Oooooooooo)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations
(Oooooooooo)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations
(Im feelin it)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations

Close my eyes
Shes somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look her in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world(she takes me there)
(Chorus)
(Oooooooo)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations
(Oooooooo)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations
(Im feelin it)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations
(Im feelin it)
Im pickin up good vibrations
(Hey hey)
Shes giving me excitations

Im feelin it
Im feelin it
Im feelin it
Im feelin it
Im feelin it
Im feelin it
Feelin it
Ooooooooo
(Chorus)

Only thing i chase is money, if you tell me where its at

When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

Not me bitch, i said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

---Fade---
I could make you care if only you'd let me
I could make you care, you'd never forget me
I can't resist, I'd be a fool to try
I know if once we kissed, I could kiss my heart goodbye
I knew this was love the moment I found you
So I planned my life, it's built all around you
Give me this chance, darling if you only would
I could make you care, I know I could

[Verse 1]
Jeane
The low-life has lost its appeal
And I'm tired of walking these streets
To a room with its cupboard bare

Jeane
I'm not sure what happiness means
But I look in your eyes
And I know that it isn't there

[Chorus 1]
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried

[Verse 2]
Jeane
There's ice on the sink where we bathe
So how can you call this a home
When you know it's a grave
But you still hope for ridding grace
As you tidy the place
But it will never be clean, Jeane

[Chorus 1]
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried

[Verse 3]
Cash on the nail
It's just a fairy tale
And I don't believe in magic anymore, Jeane
But I think you know
I really think you know
I think you know the truth
Jeane

[Verse 4]
No heavenly choir
Not for me and not for you
Because I think that you know
I really think you know
I think you know the truth, Jeane

[Chorus 2]
That we tried and we failed
That we tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
Oh Jeane

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
When I hate you, it's because I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
When I hate you, it's because I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

[Outro]
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
Some think the world is made for fun and frolic
And so do I! And so do I!
Some think it well to be all melancholic
To pine and sigh, to pine and sigh
But I, I love to spend my time in singing
Some joyous song, some joyous song
To set the air with music bravely ringing
Is far from wrong, is far from wrong
Harken! Harken! Music sounds afar
Tralala... Joy is everywhere, funiculi funicula!
Ah me! 'Tis strange that some should take to sighing
And like it well, and like it well
For me, I have not thought it worth the trying
So cannot tell, so cannot tell
With laugh and dance and song the day soon passes
Full soon is gone, full soon is gone
For mirth was made for joyous lads and lasses
To call their own, to call their own

[Doolin-Dalton reprise]
Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
"All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to
Find your seats?"
Watch 'em duelin' (duelin')
Doolin-Dalton (Dalton)
High or low, (high, low), it's all the same
Easy money and faithless women
You will never kill the pain

Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die?
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back

[Desperado reprise]
The queen of diamonds let you down
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out
And it's fin'lly turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado
(Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust
(Maybe tomorrow)
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think, to look at me
That I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway

I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes

I live above the grocers' store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the lamp that shines above the grocers' store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfil their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no-one will recall me

And I can't see the water
For the tears in my eyes
Everytime my baby and me go up town
Police come and they knock me down
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain

Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain

Early one morning, half past four
Cocaine came knockin' on my door
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when
Cocaine, all around my brain

Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm gonna take her in my arms
I'm gonna hold her all night long
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

So now, hurry up Mister Man
Load just as fast as you can
The plane is already late
I'm gonna get home as soon as I can
I wanted to take a bus
But they said the road was bad
I started to take a train but a freight was all they had

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm gonna take her in my arms

I'm gonna hold her all night long
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
If there is something wrong
Want to you please let me know
Because my baby needs me
And I really really must go
How bad I wanna see my woman
I guess you'll never know
I would start tryin' to walk
But walkin' is too slow

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
I'm gonna take her in my arms
I'm gonna hold her all night long
I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
By the time I get to Phoenix she’ll be rising
She’ll find the note I left hanging on her door
Oh she’ll laugh when she reads the part that says I’m leaving
'Cause I’ve left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque she’ll be working
She’ll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she’ll just hear that phone keep on ringing on the wall that’s all

By the time I make Oklahoma she’ll be sleeping
She’ll turn softly and call my name out low
And she’ll cry just to think I’d really leave her oh
Though time and time I’ve tried to tell her so
She just didn’t know I would really go

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
So in love, sad as could be
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts

[Chorus: The Temptations]
'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness
A pretty face may be some guy's taste
But I'll take lovin' in its place

[Chorus: The Temptations]
'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, oh baby, oh yeah, oh yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, oh yeah

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
My friends ask what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality
Now show me a girl, a girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' every time

[Chorus: The Temptations]
Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I believe that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

[Outro: David Ruffin & (The Temptations)]
So if you're lookin' for a lover (Oh yeah)
Don't judge a book by its cover (Oh yeah)
She may be fine on the outside (Oh yeah)
But so untrue on the inside (Oh yeah)

[Intro]
Baby, I have something that I want to ask you (Baby)
So sit back and listen...

[Verse 1]
Hey Miss Beloved, we are gathered here
To join each other hand and hand
No more playing house, no
'Cause I want to make it real, do you understand?
To have and to hold (mmm-hmm), until death do us part
No one, no one could ever interrupt the beats of our heart
'Cause this is gonna last...

[Chorus]
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
This is gonna last forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

[Verse 2]
Now, there's no one here to speak out
And interrupt this ceremony, ah baby, yeah (baby, just say)
All you got to do is say (you love me)
Say that you love me and we will walk
(And we will walk down the aisle, watching the people smile
Flowers are everywhere, nothing else can compare)
Yeah, girl, you got the kind of love that makes a man like me
Want to settle down, a picket fence and a house, yeah

[Chorus]
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

[Bridge]
Girl, I'm down on my knees
So what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be
(Talk to me, baby) what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be
(2 words, yeah) What's it gonna be, what's gonna be
Baby, you and me; baby, you and me; baby, you and me
(And it's you and me) Baby, you and me
Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro over Chorus]
Forever, baby; you and me, baby
I will be your man, you will be my lady
We'll walk hand in hand, side by side
I will be the perfect groom, you, the perfect bride
Would you just think about it, baby? Think about it, baby
You and me will be together, girl
Rain, sleet, snow, no matter what the weather
Just think about it, baby; think about it, girl
We'll be making love for eternity, raise a family, girl
I'm on my knees saying (marry me) Marry me
(Marry me) 'Cause I love you, baby
(Marry me) There's no other, baby
(Marry me) For you, baby
(Marry me) Said a picket fence
(Marry me) A dog and a house
(Marry me) About 12 kids
You cooking me breakfast in the morning and I'm taking the garbage out (marry me)
Marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me, (hey) marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me...

Born in the month of June
No silver spoon to help you out
Your Mother had you naturally
Naturally's the way you came out

You know your your own mind
And you show it to me
Give me the high sign
When you want to be free
And open up my eyes
To the wonders that you see

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

For the love that's been given you
Is the one thing time can't erase
And evryday it's growin'
Like the knowin' smile upon your face
You're startin' out strong
You get a kick out of life
You like to sing songs
Be in the spotlight
And when everybody's watchin' you
You shine so bright

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

You know your your own mind
And you show it to me
Give me the high sign
When you want to be free
And open up my eyes
To the wonders that you see

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

Release all these demons
Screaming at me
They must be defeated
Eventually some time this century
Please pardon me cause me I'm just ventin'
But people will bleed if we don't come to grips with
These evil seas that we playin with big business
They never solve it defenseless
And still we so senseless

When I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none

If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you
Take my 32-20 now and break her half in two
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
I got a 32-30, makes the camp all right

[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
Gonna shoot my pistol, shoot my Gatling gun
Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my Gatling gun
You made me love you, now your man has come
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
I got a 32-20 now it's a burning hell

[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in, sure ain't gonna help her none
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
With this 32-20 laying up and down my breast
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still, the dear Christ enters in

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels, the great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel
What the world needs now
Is love, sweet love
No, not just for some
But for everyone

Yeah the world needs now
Some love, sweet love
That's the only thing
That there's just too little
(but not in Vancouver).. of!
Those were high times back in Delhi
I was left for dead
Everybody beat it to L.A
So the papers read

But I said
"No, this is not where I get dropped off
Keep the dough
I'm here to blow the top off it"

Sixty-eight back in Chicago
Watched my friends all fall
Now they're waiting down in old Key Largo
For their man to call

All laid back
Sitting in the redwood sauna
Hanging slack
Like some dazed iguana

I'd choose the bruised up moon over the sun
I'd lose, I guess I'm confused
What's number one?
What's number one?
I'm a fine one to be talking
Dig the mastermind
You see even if you hold the key
The door's locked from behind

But I left
I was playing out a lone part
I was deaf to whispers
Of my own heart

I'd choose the bruised up moon over the sun
I'd lose, I guess I'm confused
What's number one?
What's number one?

Like a miner seeks that main gold vein
I'll search on
Cutting through against the grain
Keeps me sane

I'd choose the bruised up moon over the sun
I'd lose, I guess I'm confused
What's number one?
What's number one?

I'd choose the bruised up moon
I'd lose, I guess I'm confused
What's number one?
Caught in a quicksand
And I'm starting to sink
So tired of struggling
That my mind can barely think
I don't know where I'm going
Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do

My Fuel supply is finished
There ain't nothing left to burn
I need someone to help me
But I don't know which way to turn
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night

I'm rolling and tumbling
Spinning end over end
Got to have some peace and quiet
So I can find myself again
Still if you ask me what's the matter
I just don't know what to say
There's people all around me
But I feel so alone
I guess they'd like to help me
But I have to do it on my own
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night
I wish I knew
Someone like you could love me
I wish I knew
You place no one above me

Did I mistake this
For a real romance?
I wish I knew
But only you can answer

If you don't care
Why let me hope and pray so?
Don't lead me on
If I'm a fool, just say so

Should I keep dreaming on
Or just forget you?
What shall I do?
I wish I knew

I wish I knew
Someone like you could love me
I wish I knew
You place no one above me
Did I mistake this
For a real romance?
I wish I knew
But only you can answer

If you don't care
Why let me hope and pray so?
Don't lead me on
If I'm a fool just say so

Should I keep dreaming on
Or just forget you?
What shall I do?
I wish I knew

I wish I knew
Someone like you could love me

I wish I knew
What shall I do?
I wish I knew
Someone like you could love me
To some reality appears normal
To me it seems vested with an important light
Particular, a light
Sacred, a light

To address this universe
With nobility, emotions
As long as man will exploit man
As long as humanity will
Split between masters and servants
As long as man will exploit man
Split between masters and servants
There will be no normality and no peace
One, two, three

Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabama once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor, boo boo boo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama

Ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama, ah ah ah
Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
(Yes, they do!)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how about you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama, oh, sweet home baby
Where the skies are so blue and the governor's true
Sweet home Alabama, Lordy
Lord, I'm coming home to you, yeah yeah
Montgomery's got the answer
Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
Come and they go
Like breeze
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They come and they go
Like spirits
They vanish at dawn
My heart
Suspended in time
Like you
Vanish like tears in the rain

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away
Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
They come and they go
Like spirits
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away
Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel
Girls

(Lord)

[Verse 1]
I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Through the buyers and the sellers
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells

[Chorus 1]
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows

[Verse 2]
The cars and buses bustled through the bedlam of the day
I looked through window glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated through chrome-plate, the clock struck slowly half-past-noon

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Through the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees

[Chorus 2]
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows

[Verse 3]
He asked me for a dollar more, he cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride and share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb and stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand, another hand reached out for more

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades

[Chorus 3]
You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows
You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows
Now that I'm a woman
I'm always dreaming of romance
I'm always dreaming about the perfect man
Who'd take me in his arms and understand, understand me

My name is Miss Understood
I'm just a girl who wants true love like anyone would
I'm Miss Understood
Isn't there a man who understands me?

He picked me up at midnight (Oh)
When all the town was fast asleep
We danced 4 the man in the moon above
Understanding's cheap when U fall in love, fall in love

Just call me Miss Understood
I'm just a girl who wants true love like anyone would
I'm Miss Understood
Isn't there a man who understands me?

I want a lover that can satisfy the hunger of my lonely heart
Gotta have a lover with a PhD in undercover art
Now that I'm a woman
I'm always looking 4 romance (Romance)
I'm always looking 4 the perfect man
Who'd take me in his arms and understand, understand me

Just call me Miss Understood
I'm just a girl who wants true love like anyone would
I'm Miss Understood
Isn't there a man who understands...

Miss Understood
I'm just a girl who wants true love like anyone would
I'm Miss Understood
Isn't there a man who understands...

Miss (Miss, Miss) Understood
I'm just a girl who wants true love like anyone would
I'm Miss Understood

[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over (Yeah)
When I saw you and her talking deep
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh

[Chorus]
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me child naw naw whoo ooh

[Verse 2]
So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free now whoo ooh, Woo oh
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking of your kiss
And your warm embrace yeah
When a reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face whoo ooh

[Chorus]
And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
And baby, baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me

[Intro]
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
My first love was a chick from the sticks named Geneva
Had to take the 88 upstate just to see her
My mother never liked her, my father didn't either
After 22 years, I got eager and had to leave her
Now I'm realizing how much I really need her
But something told me follow my heart and head eastwards
That's when I met Brooklyn, but Brooklyn was a cheater
The second I turned my back, Jay and Weezy tag-teamed her
So I started packing, she asked me "what happened?"
Told her I was leavin' for her older sister Manhattan
Manhattan was into rap, so we started chit-chatting
And she was Chinese, Italian, Black and a quarter Latin
Super high maintenance and way too into fashion
Didn't even tell her piece and left her number on a napkin
Damn, but back then was back then
Now I heard she went Hollywood and began acting

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh, somebody take me home
Please take me home

[Verse 2]
And after Manhattan, I was acting silly
Messing with a stick body jewel named Philly
But that didn't work out too great
I'm vegetarian and all she ate was cheese steak
I went to Baltimore for Mary and almost got married, man
But she was self-centered, always stuck in Mary Land
I knew a slim thing named Virginia
I swear to God her body's smoking, but she kept gettin thinner
And I'll never forget my first trissie
In the bins with the Carolina Twins gettin' busy
I know they miss me but I had to leave early
On the 85 doin 85 ridin' dirty
And my Georgia piece Savanna
Used to stay in Atlanta
Accent so thick, I couldn't even understand her
And that's when I realized
I damn near ran through the whole I-95

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh, somebody take me home
Please take me home

[Verse 3]
Yeah, then I met Miami, she was spanish
Miami te amo, me llamo Travie
She could tell that I wasn't bilingual
I don't know todito, but I know un poquito
We can hit South Beach and drink mojitos
And maybe you can introduce me to your people
Ha, yo no voy pa' tra
My first love keep on calling
You no voy pa' ya
I think I finally found where imma stay
On I-95
But never forget the 88, no

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh, somebody take me home
Please take me home

[Verse 1]
People making lists, buying special gifts
It's a time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just a present from a store

[Chorus]
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love, oh

[Verse 2]
People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

[Outro]
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Tom, Dick, and Harry, and Suzy, too
Need love every day as much as you
Give love on Christmas day (On Christmas day)
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas day (On Christmas Day)
Who do you think you are?
What do you mean when you put us all down
Walking round in circles
Your nose to the ground
You think you're saying somethin'
Just 'cause you're makin a sound
You say you've seen it all
You don't care to see no more
But you don't get up an go
Until they throw you out the door
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to roam
It's a long long long long long long way
Way to go home
Who do remind me of
What do you do
When you do your own time
Did you run away
From the scene of your crime
I feel as though i know you
Could you spare me a dime
It's a lot less than a prison
But it's more than a jail
I'd tell you all about it
But that's another day
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to roam
It's a long long long long long long long long way
Way to go home
You say you've seen it all
You don't care to see no more
Of the hungry, the homeless
The sick and the poor
You say you've seen enough
To last you all your days
Like the moon in high heaven
You're just going through a phase
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to roam
It's a long long long long long long long long way
Way to go home
Who do you want to be?
What do you need
To set your body free?
I don't mean to pry
This ain't no third degree
But looking at you baby
You remind myself of me
If there's anyway to tell you
Anyway, anyway to persuade
I'd really love to spare you
The mistakes I've made
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to go
It's a long long long long long long long long way
Way to go home
Shells on the floor
The writing's on the wall
Bullets in your store
Says "I'm hunting for you all"

Field full of dope
I'm harvesting my hope
Shipping out speed boats
So we're not broke

Coca-cola floats
The stock market broke
Somewhere in Angola we're still craving for a goat

Send me a post
Yeah, send me something you wrote
School of the hard knocks
We don't like to boast

Go down the road
Their cars are rolling slow
Boys fighting laws
Got their AKs on show
Kids playing ball
They growing like they know
Wanna make that doe
Just to have something to show

Buy Tees and Gold
Bandanas and hoes
Freedom costs money and they're feeling really bored

Vitamins are low
Amphetamines high
Busting out shots
On rings and chicken pie

Shells on the floor
The writing's on the wall
Bullets in your store
Says "I'm hunting for you all"

Fields filled with dope
I'm harvesting my hope
Shipping out speed boats
So we're not broke

Why you gotta make me out like this
Why you gotta make me out like this
I never wanted none of this shit
Why you gotta make me out like this
I never asked for none of this shit
Why you gotta make me out like this
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
Talking about, talking about war war war
I rather talk about moi
The old man rhythm's gotten in my shoes

So be my guest you got nothing to loose
Won't you let me take you on a see cruise

Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

Tall in the saddle, we spend Christmas Day, driving the cattle over snow sovered-plains
All of the good gifts given today, ours is the sky and the wide open range
Back in the cities they have different ways, football and eggnog and Christmas Parades
I'll take my saddle, I'll take the reins, It's Christmas for cowboys wide-open plains

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night, the stars overhead are Christmas tree lights
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray, It's Christmas for cowboys, wide-open plains

Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day, driving the cattle over snow-covered plains
All of the good gifts given today, ours is the sky and the wide open range
It's Christmas for cowboys, wide open plains
Do I watch cartoons?
Class of 3000

Talk what you heard, pay your penny
That means I could throwdown, oh yeah
Olly olly oxen free your body
When we come to your town, oh, yeah

Jump up and touch the sky
Fall till you hit the dance floor, oh, yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more

That's better than throwin' up
I'm Eddie and with my horn I'll blow you away
I'm Kim and I'm Kam
I'm on the turntables and I make the keyboard jam
I'm Philly Phil and I play bass
So I got that bottom, bow your bottom

You know who I am, I'm Tamika
And with this here guitar I'm a superstar
Hey, all people, I'm Madison and I'm a Pisces
No, Madison, you're supposed to let them know what instrument you play
Oh, um, I play violin and I think we're comin' to the end

Bye
Oh, the summer time is coming
And the leaves are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Blooms around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go

If my true love she won't go
Oh, I'll sure find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go
(Bum-bum-bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum-bum)

Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

(Bum-bum-bum-bum)
(Bum-bum-bum-bum)

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders, of His love
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns

Joy to the world, the Lord is come

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
There is nothing glamorous in this simple town
But there's this special flower that can only bloom right here
And all the heavy burdens in our heart
Get carried away
The wind can smooth the wrinkles of the past

Like a dazzling reflection in the sky
I hear the distant calling of the ancient ripples of the sea
And I realize that your laughter reminds me
Of the soothing sound of the gentle ocean

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
And your heart can't cover up the look of loneliness
You don't have to reveal it to me
But anytime you need it
These faces so familiar in your heart
Wait for you to reach to their hands

[Chorus: Wanya Morris & Boyz II Men]
I wanna know if that place
That I've been once before
Hasn't ever changed
And remains the place that always will be there for me
'Til the last goodbye I'll cherish it
And I can't stop looking back to see
That you're smiling waving back at me
Gonna bite my lips not to cry
And I'm trying to fight this feeling
But the tears make it so hard to see
I'll be waiting for the day
We can reunite again
Where the flowers bloom
For just me and you

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
There is something that the shadows can't explain
Something so simple and so obvious, that we forget
Behind the cloudy surface of it all, if we look up above
We'll see the sunshine illuminate everything we see
All the past and present faces here are all to stay
Each prayer wishes new memories
I'm proud to have it all
These memories alive inside my heart
Blossoming vividly one by one

After the rain the roads are muddy
And there's puddles everywhere
And we clearly see all the footsteps
In this journey thru this life we lead
And I pray these tears can find a way
And can breathe life back into the day
When the weltered petals in my heart once again blossoming
And I'll whisper to the ocean breeze
And my wish will soar above the seas
And a rainbow in the sky will appear for you and I
Glistening in the sun, shine for everyone

[Bridge: Wanya Morris & Shawn Stockman]
Hey, the only place where the flowers bloom
The only place where this wind can blow
The only place you can hear this song
The only place you can see these signs
The only place where this flower blooms
The only place where the wind can blow

[Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Oh, I wanna know if that place
That I've been once before
Hasn't ever changed
And remains the place that always will be there for me
And I'll try to fight this feeling
But the tears may get so hard to see
I'll be waiting for the day
When we can reunite again

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
After the rain and roads are muddy
And there's puddles everywhere
And we clearly see the footsteps
In this journey through this life we lead
And I try to fight this loneliness
But the tears make it so hard to see
Even thru the scars and memories
I won't forget you and me
So radiantly shining through
The horizon as it rises high
And the wind carries this star, relive the memories
Oh, still I'll be waiting for you

[Verse 1]
I know you're leavin' me behind
I'm seeing you, darlin', for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while

[Verse 2]
We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now, now, I'm feeling mine
I tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped in a cradle
Let me know joy before I grieve
Just once more, darling, before you leave

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, rock me, rock me a little while

[Verse 3]
I'm losing you and my happiness
My life is over, I must confess
I'll never, never see your smiling face no more
I'll never, never hear your knock on my door
Before you leave me, leave me behind
Please let me feel happy just one more time

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms, come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling, and rock me, rock me a little while

[Verse 4]
I said I never wouldn't beg, I said I wouldn't plead
Here I am, baby, begging you please
Baby, baby, please, baby, baby, please
Baby, take me in your arms
Come on and rock me, and rock me a little while
Hold me darling
It's not always the land that's the hardest and bitterest
It's the man who has the hard bitter attitude
Toward his fellow man or toward the land
Such is the case that you will find in this following song
About a man's attitude toward his fellow man and toward this land

I walked in the big yard to feel the warm sunshine
A ninety-nine year man stepped over to me
He offered a smoke and he said as I rolled it
Tomorrow I'm going to break out and go free

They watch us by sunlight they watch us by spotlight
But I know a way for a man to go free
Down under my cell I'm diggin' a tunnel
The walls of a prison will never hold me

I told him that I'd have no part of his scheming
My time would be over one year from today
His eyes blazed with fire and he looked right through me
Bitter but broken again he did say
They watch us by sunlight...

Next morning at breakfast the old man was missing
Then we all heard the rifles high up on the wall
He'd gone through the tunnel just like he had promised
And they said he was crying when they saw him fall

They watch us by sunlight...

[Verse 1]
I was just minding my business when
Ms. Purdy, you came walking
My heart stopped said, "What is this", just
As soon as you started talking
Something happened deep within me (Well)
All of a sudden I got this feeling
A chill came from feet to head and then I
Turned away from you and said to myself
This is not supposed to happen, brother
You've been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell

[Chorus]
You made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (oh Lord) made me love you babe
Said you made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (good Lord) made me love you babe
You made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
(Said it wasn't in my plans)
Made me love you babe,  made me love you babe
Ooh, look at you

[Verse 2]
Said you must be one of the top models (Well)
Body curved like a pop bottle (Well)
Got me sweating like a boxer, baby
I done stumbled up on a perfect lady (OWW)
Could this be what heaven sent to me
An angel come to set me free
Love has been a stranger to me
And myself keeps telling me that
This is not supposed to happen, brother
You've been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell

[Chorus]
You made me love you
You made me love you babe, (Oh yeah) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (Hoo) made me love you babe
Hey, you made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (Yeah)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Aw baby, you made love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (Aw, love)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe

[Bridge]
Said the power of love you see
Are 10 billion wonders to me (Like the moon and stars above)
There's a whole new world for my eyes to see (Yes, sir)
So much joy, darling, you put in me
And now the sun is shining
Where there used to be rain, oh Lord
And now no more loneliness (No more loneliness)
No more hurt (No more hurt)
No more pain (No)
You made, woo!
You made me love you

[Chorus]
You made me love you babe, (Woo) made me love you babe (Yes, you did)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Hey, you made me love you
You made me love you babe, (Hey, hey, hey) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
You made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
(I was minding my business)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
You made me love you, yeah
You made me love you babe, (Oh) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (Yes sir) made me love you babe
You, you, you made me love you
You made me love you babe, (Yeah) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Hey, hey, you made me love you

You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (Somebody)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe

It brings love, peace, strength, and joy
You made me love you, hey, yeah...

[Verse 1]
Piece of newspaper at my feet
We go blowing down the street
Got our stories old and new
Need someone to tell 'em to

[Chorus]
We don't have to be eye to eye (Face to face)
I'm not asking for miracles (Nor saving grace)
And I don't need another heart (To have and hold)
All I want is a friend I can talk to (Soul to soul)
Oh, soul to soul (Soul to soul)
Mmm, oh yeah

Like a notebook on a shelf
Tired of talking to myself
I'm wishing somebody (Somebody) passing by (Passing by)
Would pick me up and look inside

We don't have to be eye to eye (Or face to face)
I'm not asking for miracles (Miracles) (Or saving grace)

We don't have to be eye to eye (Or be face to face)
I'm not asking for miracles (Or saving grace)
And I don't need another heart (To have and hold)
All I want is someone I can talk to (Soul to soul)

[Outro]
Oh, I need a friend right now (Soul to soul)
Someone I can talk to (Soul to soul)
I'm feeling lonely right now (right now baby)
I just need to know you're there anytime of the day and night
I need somebody who's willing to listen
Shining, shining, shining, shining so brightly right now
I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders
Soul to soul
Does anybody hear me calling?
Chorus (Syleena Johnson):
A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down
A way that all, all falls down
I tell you oh, it all falls down

Chorus:
Till fades out
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
All of my memories lay in the life of the highway
All of my nights in old motels and sleeping alone
All of my days on the road with no one beside me
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun, where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm, and a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try

[Verse 3]
'Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways
Scratchin' off sunsets, and walkin' around in the maze
Some sweet taxi dancer tryin' to save me from bein' alone
Ah, it's much worse than lonely, there is no place I really belong
I want to be home

[Verse 4]
I'm leavin' this city life, in my mind I'm flyin' away
I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays
I'm leavin' the trash cans, the bright lights, the telephone lines
I'm leavin' my sorrow and all of my memories behind
To see what I find

[Verse 5]
Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun, where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm, a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try
Somewhere to grow older, somewhere to lay down and die
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Oh news said it

[Verse 1: John Legend]
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I got to love you while I'm here baby
Did you know?

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
The news said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country warring
Leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower, baby
Nowhere to go, oh I

Could you love me quickly? Quickly!
I, want you to love me like you know
The world's about to end baby, Quickly!

[Verse 2: Brandy (John Legend)]
You said you didn't even know my name, but

Before they come crashing down
Cause I heard the news said

[Pre-Chorus: Brandy (John Legend)]
The news said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming

[Intro: Wanya Morris]
Hey, man
You know, sometimes you've just got to listen to yourself
Or not listen to yourself
That's how it is
As you get a little older you start realizing things
Realize it's your ego
It's your ego that's your enemy, you know?
That's the only thing that can stop you, is your ego
Hey, it's crazy man, but we got you, so listen

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman, Wanya Morris]
My ego had me doing things that I thought I'd never do
(Thought I'd never do)
Like being with another shorty when I was with you
(When I was with you)
Unnecessary shopping sprees for things I didn't need (Uh)
Maybe it was a little necessary
But looking back, it was greed
Big chains, big cars, big chips
More things, more girls, long trips
Maybe if I would've thought of it
I would have had a chance to enjoy it now

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men]
But now I know it was just my ego

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
My ego was my enemy
I thought it was a friend to me
But it was a curse to me
'Cause it brought out the worst in me
My ego was my enemy (Enemy)
I thought it was a friend to me (Friend to me)
But it was a curse to me (Curse to me)
It brought out the worst in me

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
I was ballin' like a man when I was a boy
Livin' every man's dreams
(Livin' every man's dreams)
Spending mad time at the strip club, too much cream
(Dollar, dollar bills, y'all)
Nobody couldn't tell me nothin' 'cause I was feeling myself
(Feeling myself)
Same thing almost cost me my whole life, and all of my wealth
Chicks came and went, I stayed (I stayed)
G'd up 'cause I was paid ('Cause I was paid)
Damn all those games I played
Hey, what more can I say? But now

[Pre-Chorus: Boyz II Men]
But now I know it was just my ego

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
My ego was my enemy
I thought it was a friend to me
But it was a curse to me
'Cause it brought out the worst in me (My ego)
My ego was my enemy (Enemy)
I thought it was a friend to me (Friend to me)
But it was a curse to me (Curse to me)
It brought out the worst in me

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
If I could turn back the hands of time
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause it made me the man I am today

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
(My ego) My ego was my enemy (Was my enemy)
I thought it was a friend to me (Oh, ooh)
But it was a curse to me
'Cause it brought out the worst in me
My ego was my enemy (Was my enemy)
I thought it was a friend to me
But it was a curse to me (But it was a curse to me)
It brought out the worst in me (Oh, ooh)
My ego was my enemy (Enemy)
I thought it was a friend to me (Friend to me)
But it was a curse to me (Curse to me)
'Cause it brought out the worst in me
My ego was my enemy (Enemy)
I thought it was a friend to me (Friend to me)
But it was a curse to me (Curse to me)
It brought out the worst in me (Oh, ooh ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was a sailor, I was lost in sea
I was under the waves, before love rescued me
I was a fighter I could turn on a threat
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

Ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue when I fell into a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

Love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
I was there when they crucified my lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...
What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?
What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?

You're jumping 'round like a lamb
Just because you put me in 

[Incomprehensible]
And I'll live my life the way that I want
But I just got to hold you and it's a sin to talk so

What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?
What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?

I will send for you and you make me feel so blue
Little dear, what do you want me to do?

[Incomprehensible] just to see me through
But I can't say that I'm keen and so blue so, yeah

What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?
What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?
Now you're jumping 'round like a lamb
Just because you take me in 

[Incomprehensible]
And I'll live my life the way that I want
But I just gone through love and it is here to talk, so

What am I to do, my dear
So that I may win your love?
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas

Merry Christmas to you
Learn to love or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Learn to love or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happening
And something may happen to you

Well, if you know you don't want me baby
Why in the world would you let me be
Yes if you know you don't want me baby
Tell me why would you let me be
Because it's better to live without you baby
Than to live on in misery

Yeah, midnight finds me crying
Oh daylight finds me crying too
Yes midnight finds me crying
Daylight finds me crying too
You better straighten your mind pretty baby
Because something may happen to you
Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I wanna lose in you - Baby, can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me...

Ooh, baby...

(Hey, lover...) All I wanna see is the love in your eyes
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs...
(Hey, lover...) Oh, feel this burning flame;
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same...

Tell me that you feel the same way I do;
Tell me that you love me, girl...

If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day;
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may...

Soft and wet...
Soft and wet...
Soft and wet...
Soft and wet...

Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death;
Ooo wee, baby, you leave me without
Breath... ooh, baby...
Ooh, yeah...

(Hey, lover...) You're just as soft as a lion tamed
And you're just as wet as the evening rain...
(Hey, lover...) I really dig it when you call my name;
Your love is driving me, you're driving me insane...

Crazy, baby, oh, girl, crazy 'bout your love...

Soft and wet... (You know...)
You are soft and wet... (For sure, girl...)
Your love is soft and wet...
Ooh, soft and wet...

Oh, oh, oh...

[Verse 1]
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
You know, every house has a door
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
And every room has a floor
Every fence has a gate (And every beast has a mate)

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody's got something but me
I ain't got nothing

[Verse 2]
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
Every stove has a fire
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
And every car has a tire
Every fish has a bowl (And every shoe has a sole)

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody's got something but me
I ain't got nothing

[Bridge]
Now I don't care about politics
And things across the sea (Across the sea)
All I wanna to do is love
And have somebody love me
I need, I need somebody

[Verse 3]
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
Every lion has a den
(Shoo-wop-shoo-wop)
And every little pig has its pen
Every road has a way (And they tell me every dog has its day)

[Outro]
Everybody (Woo-hoo), everybody's got something but me
I ain't got nothing
I ain't got nothing, oh no
I ain't got nothing

[Chorus]
It's too bad
That my brother can't be here today
It's too bad
That my brother can't be here today

[Verse 1]
Well, one time he came around to my house, you know
And I was kinda like outta my mind
And I seen him a-cryin' away
I say hey baby, hey yeah
Hear me cry
Hey baby, baby, baby
Hear me cry
Remember that room full of mirrors I was tellin' you about?
I said brother
Don't tell me you come around here to hustle like the rest of people do
I say brother, brother
Don't tell me you came around here hustlin' like the rest of those people do
And he said "no no, brother Jim"
He said "I'm just comin' here to look for life like you"
He said "don't fear me brother, baby"
I say that what happen sometime
When you lose yourself in nothin'
And he looked at me, you know he said these two blondes around the next day
I said Lord, please don't lose yourself
That what happen when you lose yourself on nothin'
He said "baby, you know me, I'm your brother"
Please don't take me for nothin'

[Chorus]
It's too bad, too bad
Lord, my brother just can't be here with me today
It's too bad
My brother can't be here with me today

[Verse 2]
But he came around to my house and uh asked for me uh, help me out
I said, man go the hell on your hustlin' way, yeah
And I think they send him away to the war today, heh heh
So I'll go way across the tracks, way across the tracks
And man they treat me the same as you do too
Well, I'll go way back over across the track
And they treat me the same as you do
Say man until you come back, completely back, go back where you came from too
Thanks
Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Oh, round, round, round, round, round
Oh

But now it's getting late
He'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
One more summer
And your dream comes true
When I was a cowboy out on de western plains
When I was a cowboy out on de western plains
Well, I made about half a million just puttin' on the bridle an' reins
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay

Oh, de hardest battle was found on de western plains
Oh, de hardest battle was found on de western plains
When me an' a bunch of cowboys run into Jesse James
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay

Oh, de hardest battle was found on Bunker's Hill
Oh, de hardest battle was found on Bunker's Hill
When me an' a bunch of cowboys run into Buffalo Bill
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay

If your house catches afire, an' there ain't no water 'round
If your house catches afire, an' there ain't no water 'round
Throw your jerry out the window, let the doggone shack burn down
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay

Come on, all you cowboys, an' don't you wanna go
Come on, all you cowboys, an' don't you wanna go
How to meet ther the lone ranger, an a range of Buffalo
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay
Come a caw caw yippee come a caw caw yippee yippee yay, yay, yay yay

[Verse 1]
He met her in a French café (Yvette)
She slipped in sideways like a cat (Yvette)
Sidelong glances, what a wary little stray (Yvette)
She sticks in his mind like that

[Chorus 1]
Saying, "Avez-vous un allumette?"
With her lips wrapped around a cigarette
Yvette in English saying, "Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

[Verse 2]
He's fumbling with her foreign tongue (Yvette)
Reaching for words and drawing blanks (Yvette)
A loudmouth is stricken deaf and dumb (Yvette)
In a bistro on the left bank

[Chorus 2]
"If I were a painter," Picasso said
"I'd paint this girl from toe to head"
Yvette in English saying, "Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

[Verse 3]
Burgundy nocturne tips and spills (Yvette)
They trot along nicely in the spreading stain (Yvette)
New chills, new thrills for the old uphill battle (Yvette)
How did he wind up here again?

[Chorus 3]
Walking and talking, touched and scared
Uninsulated wires left bare
And Yvette in English going, "Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

[Verse 4]
What blew her like a leaf his way? (Yvette)
(Up in the air and down to Earth) (Yvette)
First she flusters, then she frays (Yvette)
So quick to question her own worth

[Chorus 4]
Her cigarette burns her fingertips
As it falls like fireworks she curses it
Then sweetly in English she says, "Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

[Verse 5]
He sees her turn and walk away (Yvette)
Skittering like a cat on stone (Yvette)
Her high heels clicking, what a wary little stray (Yvette)
She leaves him by the Seine alone

[Chorus 5]
With the black water and the amber lights
And the bony bridge between left and right
Yvette in English saying, "Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."
Love befall from the apple tree
None have (verve?) left to come to me
(thus fallen, I turned around)
A good fair distance
Bringing my presents
Dressed like I had been
Seeing the woman
Seeing the woman
(finally, eyes familiar)
With her bandaged face
She was mystery
With the falling leaves
Wish these idiots
Would leave me the space
To bear my homage
To his prickly face

Love befall from the apple tree
Energy creates energy

Transmit to all of you is what I wanna do
What I want to do: not work but transmit
To transmit what i want
I have thought about being (nature's ????)
But I am worried about the health risks
Those who work but don't earn
Those who earn and don't work
(we want peace of the senses)
She could be my friend
??(And the jealous end)??
She was mystery
Of the (fallen?) rain

Transmit to all of you is what I wanna do
What I want to do: not work but transmit
To transmit what i want
My tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There something that I got to say:

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do

Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint rainbows all around her
Don't let her see the cloudy sky

Once upon a time
That little girl was mine

If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you
So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
The sound that you're listening to is from my guitar
That's named Lucille. I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation. Oh you might say
Brought me fame
I don't think I could just talk enough about Lucille
Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help
Me call my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this was
The thing that I wanted to do. But somehow or other
When I went in the army I picked up on Lucille, and
Started singing blues

Well, now when I'm paying my dues, maybe you don't
Know what I mean when I say paying dues, I mean when
Things are bad with me. I can always, I can always
You know like, depend on Lucille

Sort of hard to talk to you myself. I guess I'll let
Lucille say a few words and then
You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do. But
When I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well for instance, if I have a girlfriend and
She misuses me, and I go home at night, maybe I'm
Lonely, well not maybe, I am lonely, I pick up Lucille
And it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to
Me, you know. Sometime I get to the place where I
Can't even say nothing

Look out

Sometime I think it's crying

You know, if I could sing pop tunes like Frank Sinatra
Or Sammy Davis Junior, I don't think I still could do
It, 'cause Lucille don't wanna play nothing but the
Blues. I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about
That. Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille
Sing, Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this. Take it easy, Lucille. I
Like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank
Sings, but I can get a little Frank, Sammy, a little
Ray Charles, in fact all the people with soul in
This
A little Mahalia Jackson in there

One more, Lucille!

Take it easy now

You know, I imagine a lot of you wanna know, a lot of
You wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille. Lucille
Has practically saved my life two or three times. No
Kidding, it really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident, and
When the car stopped turning over, it fell over on
Lucille, and it held it up off me, really, it held it
Up off me. So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way I came by the name of Lucille, I was
Over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you've never heard of
That one, have you? And one night the guys started a
Ball over there, you know, they started brawling, you
Know what I mean. And the guy that was mad with his
Old lady, when she fell over on this gas tank that was
Burning for heat, the gas ran all over the floor

And when the gas ran all over the floor, the building
Caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save
Lucille. Oh I, I imagine you're still wondering why I
Call it Lucille, the lady that started that brawl that
Night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me. One more
Now, Lucille

Sounds pretty good to me. Can I do one more?

Look out, Lucille

Sounds pretty good. I think I'll try one more. All
Right
Since the last time I saw you
God has moved another mountain out of my way
Led me to green pasture turned my midnight into day
Placed my feet up on a rock to stay

Since the last time I saw you
God has calmed another raging storm in my life
Led me into safety turned my darkness into light
Now I stand in the power of his might

You would have thought that God already done enough for me
When he took my place at Calvary
But he done so much more and more
Right before my eye's
And I have no other choice
But to stand and testify, stand and testify

Since the last time I saw you
God has worked another wondrous miracle for me
Led me into triumph
Now my blinded eyes can see that Christ the lord
Performs victoriously
You would have thought that he done enough for me
When he took my place at Calvary
But he's done more and more and more every day
He makes a way and he's made a way

Since the last time I saw you things have changed
I'm not the same since the last time
There are worlds within the world
Within the world there are worlds
The situation is the universe of man
As the measure of all things
Understand that you are another world in miniature
And that in you there are the sun, the moon and also the stars
Man as the messenger of being
By analogy flesh and bones of man derive from earth
His blood from water, his breath from air
And body heat from fire
It's been my secret passion to try it
To spend my Christmas surfin', I can't deny it
I wanna spend my Christmas on the Kona Coast in Hawaii

For years I saved my pennies and planned it
The great Pacific Ocean, we'll span it
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii

Go to Hawaii
Melekalikimaka is "Merry Christmas" in Hawaii talk-a
And at Lahaina we'll count the shooting stars
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii

The suntanned beauties are everywhere
If you're comin' to the islands then you might stare
And find a girl waiting for you there in Hawaii

Kani and Wahini and the haoles, too
Wish a Melekalikimaka to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii
Go to Hawaii
Melekalikimaka is how they say it in island talk-a
The island flower fragrance in the air
We'll write a card and underneath the mango trees
We'll say, "Wish you were here with us in Hawaii"

Winter in the sun and surf'd sure be nice
In a south sea garden paradise
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii

Honolulu, Waikiki
Do you wanna come along with me?
Waimia up to Hanalai
I'd love to take you to the islands today
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee;
We don't take our trips on lsd;
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street;
We like livin' right, and bein' free
We don't make a party out of lovin';
We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
I'm proud to be an Oakie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightin's still the biggest thril of all
Leather boots are still in style for mainly footwear;
Beads and roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
And I'm proud to be an Oakie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightin's still the biggest thril of all
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, usa
Oh, oh my darling
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say
There are songs from wisdom
There are songs from Satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'
There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane
Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side
Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, lookin' good
Dance, baby, to the light
Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing
Songs we're meant to listen to
You're checkin' out the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test
Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed
Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesize a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster
The Devil have his special plan
To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners
Ay, did you know
Some songs can corrupt your flesh to dust
The only song you should live
Are songs that you can trust
The artist pays the price

[Verse 1]
Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, makes me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

[Verse 2]
Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

[Verse 3]
Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

[Outro]
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
You're kinda small
And you're such a doll
I'm glad you're mine
You're so good to me
How come you are?

You take my hand
And you understand
When I get in a bad mood
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

I know your eyes
Are not on the guys
When we're apart
You're so true to me
How come you are?
And every night
You hold me so tight
When I kiss you goodbye
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

You're my baby
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: Jean Deaux]
Now can we place a bet
You love collect calls inside of your cigarettes
I still wonder why you can't seem
To get it yet
If we go half then maybe we can spend another night
Another day another chance for us to get right
Inside these walls we watch the tables turn
You say I should've had a mother
And watch my navel yearn
There are things that I expect you know
How you gone plant a whole seed and not expect it to grow?
We just smoking too much weed
I'm still expecting to blow
Let's take a walk
Dont forget your key baby
Let's say a prayer
Come on get down on your knees baby

[Hook]
Please A-ha x3
Dont get up x3
Please A-ha x3

[Verse 2: Jean Deaux]
Theres no doubt
You know i want this
Just as much as you
What if you lyin
Then im just stuck here like a fuckin fool
Ill still be stuck even if
This is the fuckin truth
You say im running from my problems
But theres no other way
If you decide to keep it
I dont know if I'mma stay
My shoulders dislocating
Breaking under all is weight
Im just thinkin bout your lateness
It's a bad time
I want to be situated before I have mine
Lets talk a walk
Dont forget your key baby
Let's say a prayer
Come on get down on your knees
Baby

[Second Hook]
Come on get down on your knees baby
(Please A-ha x3
Don't get up x3
Please A-ha x3
Please A-ha x3
Don't get up x3)
You told me it was so, a million dreams ago
You held me in your arms, a million dreams ago
So many dreams have flown, so many nights alone
I guess I should have known, it couldn't be
I'll lock my mem'ries here in my heart
And here in my heart they'll stay
And through the years, they'll always be part
A part of a lovely day
Goodbye, good luck old friend, I'll smile and just pretend
There was no end, a million dreams ago

[Verse 1]
Lying alone, touching my skin
I'm falling under
A girl like me
And I can't hold it in
It makes me wonder
Is this for real?
It's not what it seems
You're like an angel
I'm running now
My feet off the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me, touch me
Won't you hold me close?

[Chorus]
And then we kiss
Your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush
Coming over me, over me
And when we touch
This moment when everything's still
I close my eyes and then we kiss

[Verse 2]
The feel of your hand
As it touches my hair
It makes me tremble
Don't wanna let go
Of the feelings we share
So baby, go slow
Our hearts beating fast
And my body cries
I want it to last
It's burning inside
We're getting deeper

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me, touch me
Won't you hold me close?

[Chorus 2]
You're drifting
The sun comes up
You're fading
You seem so far
I don't know if I'm awake
Open my eyes and then we kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me, touch me
Won't you hold me close?

[Chorus]
And then we kiss
And then we kiss
And when we touch
This moment when everything's still
I close my eyes and then we kiss
Time on your hands
You doodle the day
Shuffle your feet
And turn on the news
To hear what they might say

They've made a machine
A new fangled device
They're lighting the fuse
There's no need to worry
Your world will be alright

Time for a smoke
A pint and a joke
You muddle on through
Silently screaming
"What can I do?"

Till time trips you out
Larking about
Blows you away
High as a kite
On a windy day

[Interlude]
Darling, come home, back to me
Heaven, (Heaven) Heaven if you hear me, this
Say, I need you (I need you in my life)
So come on, baby (Come on)
'Cause I, I never meant to do you wrong, lady (oh, oh)
So don't you leave me dying here ('Cause I'm lost without you)
Please (Please) come back home

[Verse 1]
You made me what I am today
I hope you're satisfied
You dragged and dragged me down until
Soul within me died
You've shattered each and every dream
You fooled me right from the start
And though you're not true, may God bless you
That's the curse of an aching heart

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
You made me what I am today
I sure hope you're satisfied
You dragged me, dragged me down until
The soul within me died
You've shattered each and every dream
You fooled me right from the start
And although you're not true, may God bless you
That's the curse of an aching heart
Walking down by the river
Water running through my knees
River, river moves so free
Oh, mighty river endlessly

Ooh, mighty river
I would love to be like you
Ooh, lonely river
Has not got the time to say

I was born into the city life
It's all that I've ever known
You know it's rough getting 'round this place
So crowded, I can hardly breathe

You can only see about a block or two
In L.A. that's the truth
Looking for some country life
Some kicking room, no more city life
I want the river
Rolling, rolling, rolling on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Roll, rolling, rolling, rolling on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)

Roll, rolling, rolling, rolling on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Roll, rolling, rolling, rolling on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Roll, rolling, rolling, rolling on

It breaks my heart to see the city
I wonder why it ain't pretty
Oh, I wanna cry, wanna cry

Come on, you've got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away

You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
Led astray
Before the
Fragile defense of words
Come and stay
Bring the stars
Play in the milky night

Led astray
Before the
Fragile defense of words
Come and stay
Bring the stars
Play in the milky night
...

[Verse 1]
I memorize, I walk in line
I carry my sacrifice for the sake of the millions
All night you be the light on the water
You be the pride and the sorrow
Shower your love to me there

[Verse 2]
Summer dies before the rain
Unify every soul, together be lonely
Ride on, follow me to the sunrise
Save me the world that is broken
Nothing but love to be there

[Chorus]
Soldiers, father and son, we're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child, we're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall

[Verse 3]
Never mind, dry your eyes
You never be far away, forever beside me
Hold out, I will be your tomorrow
I will walk through the fire
Nothing but love to be there

[Chorus]
Soldiers, father and son, we're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child, we're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall

[Bridge]
I'm a little misunderstood
Living all the daydreams and nightmares
Don't do me no good
I'm a little bit on the moon
But when the word is - you love me
No moment is too soon

[Release]
All night give me the light on the water
Give me the pride and the sorrow
Showing your love to me there

[Chorus]
Soldiers, father and son, we're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child, we're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall

[Chorus / Outro] (x3)
Soldiers, father and son, we're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child, we're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall
For what are we livin' for
Boys never cry

[Outro]
Ice cream!
That's alright, that's alright, ain't no mistakes
On the one

[Verse 1]
Let me speak, let me spit out my bitterness
Born of grief and nights without sleep and festering flesh
Do you have eyes, can you see like mankind sees?
Why have you soured and curdled me?

[Refrain]
Oh you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread
And everything I fear
Come true?

[Verse 2]
Once I was blessed
I was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind
Like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words
And they sought out my company
But now the janitors of Shadowland flick their brooms at me

[Refrain]
Oh you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread
And everything I fear
Come true?

[Verse 3]
(Man is the sire of sorrow)
I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful?
Why do you crucify the saints?
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near
(We don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you)
Oh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness!
(Oh all this ranting, all this wind
Filling our ears with trash)
Breathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury!
They come blaming and shaming
(Evil doer)
And shattering me
(This vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses)

[Refrain]
Oh you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread
And everything I fear
Come true?

[Verse 4]
Already on a bed of sighs and screams
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams!
Better I was carried from the womb straight to the grave
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades
(Man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend)
Where is hope while you're wondering what went wrong?
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn?
( Evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue)
Show your face
(What a long fall from grace)
Help me understand
What is the reason for your heavy hand?
(You're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now)
Was it the sins of my youth?

[Refrain]
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true?
(Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)
Everything I dread and everything I fear come true
(Man is the sire of sorrow)
Oh you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true
I'm sitting in the railway station
Got a ticket to my destination
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Silently for me
Can't believe another day goes by
Without your love, you know I can't survive
Silly me I thought I'd play it cool
But in the end I end up playing the fool
Now I regret my decisions because I'm in love with you
You had come into my life and made my dreams come true
For you I'll do (Yes I will)

(If you love me) The time I've spent with you has been so nice
(Like you say you do) Girl you're my angel, you're my paradise (Won't you show me) I need your love, girl don't you understand (What I mean to you) Baby the sight of you was promised me one day
Because I'm in love with you
You have come into my life and made my dreams come true
For you I'll do (My darlin')...

I'll make the green grass grow in December (Grass grow)
I'll make the April rain turn to snow
I'll climb the highest mountain and search the valley low
Wherever you are, that's where I'll go

(If you love me) I need your love girl, I don't mind the change
(Like you say you do) I'm holding on girl, I'm prepared to wait (Then won't you show me) For your sweet love I'll swim the deepest seas
(What I mean to you) Just to show you what you mean to me
The sight of you was promised me one day
(Cause' I'm in love without a doubt) Cause' I'm in love with you
(My heart's gone, can't live without) You have come into my life and made my dreams come true
For you I'll do...
I'll make the green grass grow in December (grass grow)
I'll make the April rain turn into snow
I'll climb the highest mountain and search the valley low
Wherever you are, that's where I'll go

(If you need me) Girl, if you need me
(Like I needed you) Baby, won't you let me see
(Then whisper softly) Bring it down
(Hear me) While I'm pleasing you
Let me hear you, please baby let me hear you (If you need me)
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

[Verse 1: Rodney Crowell]
I'm back on board that '49 Ford in 1956
Long before the sun came up, way out in the sticks
The headlight showed a two rut roadway
Back up in the pines
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line

[Verse 2: Rodney Crowell]
I got my thrill behind the wheel upon my daddy's lap
Grandpa rode co-pilot with a flashlight and a map
Cane pole out the window, it was in the summertime
First time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line

[Hook 1: Johnny Cash]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 3: Rodney Crowell]
I never will forget that day, I know the time and place
It sounded like the whole thing came right down from outer space
I still can see those headlights and that dashboard in my mind
The first time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line

[Hook 2: Johnny Cash]
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Guitar Solo: Johnny Cash]
Ah, skinny pack
(Mmmmmmmmmmm)

[Verse 4: Rodney Crowell]
All these long years later it's still music to my ears
I swear it sounds as good right now as anything I hear
I've seen the Mona Lisa, I've heard Shakespeare read real fine
Just like hearing Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line

[Hook 3: Johnny Cash]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Outro: Johnny Cash]
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 1]
"Kiss my ass!" I said, and I threw my drink
Tequila trickling down his business suit
Must be the Irish blood, fight before you think
Turn it now, you can't kowtow, you can't undo it

[Chorus]
It's his town and that went down like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said, sic her, Rover, that went over like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon, lead balloon

[Verse 2]
An angry man is just an angry man
But an angry woman, bitch
I had to ask him for a helping hand
It came with the heart of a Bonaparte, of a frozen fish

[Chorus]
It's his town and that went down like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said, sic her, Rover, that went over like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon, lead balloon

[Bridge]
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

[Chorus]
It's his town and that went down like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said, sic her, Rover, that went over like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon, lead balloon

[Outro]
Lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

[Intro] 

[T.I. talking]:
Uncle Quincy they gon dig this
Haha, hold up
Yeaaaah!

[Chorus]:
Alright people, I wanna see you dance if your type forever
Get your hands up, say hey
And shawty you're looking good
Come here, let me see you dance
Now get ya hands up
Your hearts

[T.I.:]
I got to the park, super cool, stupid hot
He the freshest from his fitted down to the shoes and socks
Can you wanna like it, couldn't care less if you do or not
A reminder for those of you who forget
Here's the king partna', ya ain't bout to say a big deal I'm not
Fifty mill I got, double down why not
177 Aston Martin cash and carry off the lot
They say money talk but listen Shorty cause I talk a lot
Incredible, my pockets and a cherry red drop
Your money funny, big diamonds in the words red boss
We're gonna be smoking the city when I come kicking come and witness
8 hundred young women all here for Young Fif
Listen, if I really dig her, let her meet my uncle Quincy
Catch up with me suckers gonna need a solid month of Wendy
Many moons will it take you buffoons and many goons
Presents fill up any room, King back gimme room

[Chorus]

[B.o.B:]
I told the World what I'm gon do, check the charts if you want proof
Number 1 and number 2, I'll take the rest, don't mind if I do
Pull my seat up to this table in the game, where's my food
But frankly, I accomplished what they said I'll never do
Or maybe you've been sleeping or snoozing on me before
Or possibly, blocking me from opening doors
And everybody surprised now
3 years down the road
But where was everybody when albums wasn't in stores
Who cares if it ain't fair
Cause I mean?
Bob on beast, Bob on blast, Bob is everything you say
It's finesse, an expression, an emphasis on my name
Talking record labels corporations this is entertainment
Here is what I meant
They be like "hey Bob try this
Put on this shirt, put on these jeans
Put on this hat, that'd be the shit
Rap it like that, sing it like this
Yeah yeah yeah
That'll be a hit
What's his name?"
Well I'm in my own lane and that's why I ain't that"

[Chorus]

[Young Dro:]
Hey look, came on so hard
You don't see the star in me
Dro, I can do anything, you don't see the heart in me
Pressure becomes combustible
Wheels squeezing the arteries of haters
Plus my uncle is Quincy Jones so pardon me
I like riding a may

[?]
When it come to money boy, we got that?
Looking bad as ever, mansion in the panamerica
Why sick, I'm extravagant and clever
Will damage you, it's whatever
Grand Hustle Kings
I won't get off the mic until that thing starts sizzling
Block you like a histamine
This is really history
Watch ya old lady 'fore I slip in with this hickory
Like Elmo y'all tickle me
Why I still be ripping beats
Backing fantastic, tell me that you've been listening
White on white, drop back joint
T.I in a ride out
2 of the best in the game, what you gotta decide about

[Chorus]
Come
Bring it on, bring it on now

Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion
Drawn up by the thoughts I think

Oh, come on, oh
You see a set up like a deck of cards
They're sending us to early graves for all the diamonds
They use a pair of clubs to beat the spades
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away, get in front of it
Brotha, did you forget your name?
Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three brothers gone, come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?
Your anger is a gift
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Drop it
Sista, did you forget your name?
Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal, three million gone, come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero
Environment, the environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconsciousness
For example what does the billboard say?
Come and play, come and play, forget about the movement
Forget about yourself's, forget about your culture
And forget about your history and just fly, and just fly

Your anger is a gift
Yeah yeah
Bring that shit in

Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom for the real
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, yeah right
Yeah, freedom, yeah
I am a rovin' gambler, I've gambled all around
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
(I Lay my money down, lay my money down.)

I gambled up in Washington, gambled over in Spain
I'm on my way to Frisco town
To knock down my last game
(knock down my last game; knock down my last game)

I had not been in 'Frisco, many more days than three
I fell in love with a pretty little girl
And she fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me, fell in love with me.)

She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan
She whispered low in her mama's ear
"I love this gamblin' man."
("Love this gamelin' man." "Love this gamblin' man.")

"Daughter, Oh! dear daughter, how could you treat me so?
And leave your dear old mother
And with a gambler go?"
(With a gambler go? with a gambler go?)
"Mother, Oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see my face again
I'll be with the gamblin' man"
(be with the gamblin' man" be with the gamblin' man)
Said I would never be the one to give up us
If you and I should ever break up
Said I'd never be weak enough to break down
And speak of a chance that we might make up

But I'm doing it all now baby, doing it all
Yes, I'm doing it all now baby, doing it all
To make sure, oh, that you never, never, never, never, never leave me
Please don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me

Said that extra things that takes to make a woman sure
That a man's love is really true
Well, the thing's that I was too strong of a guy
To ever break down and do

But I'm doing it all now, baby, doing it all
Yes, I'm doing it all now, baby, doing it all
To make sure, oh, that you never, never, never, never, never leave me
Please don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever leave me
(Don't leave me)
Baby
(Don't leave me)
(Incomprehensible)
Yes I am on, ooh babe, yes I am on
You say you're leaving, you've shattered my dreams
All of our plans dear, forgotten it seems
Yes, it had to happen
I'm not surprised, but I'll, I'll survive

Your friends have shown you a much better way
All of my loving you baby, all of those years, ended today
Yes, you go on darlin'
I'll dry my eyes, but I'll, I'll survive

Go on! May God bless you
It was fun. While it was fun
Baby, I hate to lose you
I say I hate to lose you baby
It's all over! What's done is done

Hey! you go on darlin', seek your fortune and fame
All your good luck or bad luck
Your friends must take the blame
Oh! I can't beg you no more baby
I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive
Oh, go on! May God bless you
Oh, it was fun. While it was fun
Oh baby, I hate to lose you
I say I hate to lose you baby
It's all over! What's done is done

Hey! You go on baby, seek your fortune and fame
All your good good luck or bad luck
Friends must take the blame
Oh! I can't beg you no more
I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive

Oh! I'll, I'll survive
Baby, I'll survive
As the morning casts a thousand bits of sunlight
And they shine like diamonds on the morning dew
I believe that every single one is mine alone to see
And I believe I'm gonna love you
If it seems that there are special stars for lovers
And we see them scattered 'cross midnight blue
I believe that out of all this world, there meant for you and me
I believe I'm gonna love you
I'll take you to a magic place where no one's ever been
Where there's carpets made of flowers, and music in the wind
If you wonder why I'm giving you these treasures
Because you're like no one else I ever knew
I believe that as we walk through time, the best is yet to come
As I believe I'm gonna love you
As I believe I'm gonna love you
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do

You know what, you're lovely
You know what, you're so lovely
And, oh, what you do to me

I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
'specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For Heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos

And that's why
I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So If I hold you in my arms, I won't dance

I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they want to do

You know what, you're lovely
Ring-a-ding-ding, you're lovely
And oh what, you do to me

I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
'specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For Heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos

And that's why
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance, merci beaucoup

I know that music leads the way to romance
So If I hold you in my arms....
I won't dance
She doesn't want me, she doesn't care
I've tried so hard to let her know, but she doesn't see me there
What else can I do When Someone Doesn't Want You?
The picture's painted, I've been denied
The artist couldn't fit me in, there wasn't room for me inside
What else can I do When Someone Doesn't Want You?

When the day is over, the stars are in the sky
I'll be going, I know that this is good-bye
No tears will ever take her place
They'll disappear, but will the memory linger on
After the pain is gone?
On a river, in my boat
I'll save this sinking heart of mine
Somehow I will stay afloat
What else can I do When Someone Doesn't Want You?

When Someone Doesn't Want You, When Someone Doesn't Want You
(When that someone When she doesn't want you.)
When Someone Doesn't Want You
(When that someone When she doesn't want you.)
When Someone Doesn't Want You
(Repeat and Fade)
Oh darling, what happened to that beautiful smile?
The ones you gave me any time we were face to face
Oh is it someone else taking my place
Oh baby, what happened

Oh what happened to those fast heartbeats?
The ones that excited me so
Oh tell me, don't you love me
Oh, baby, don't you care any more?
Darling, what happened

Oh it's so sad what a little time can do
Oh when you're hanging out with another
Losing a love with you
All those good times we had
Baby, just me and you

Oh darling, before I go
There's one thing I'd like to know
Don't you love me?
Don't you care any more?
Darling, what happened

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Do you remember when
We would gaze upon
The heavens up above
Revealed within the night
Took turns in looking thru
A telescope discovering
A little star that smiled right back at us
I never strayed away far from all the crowds
A hint of solitude
Concealed behind your smile
Remember when the lights went out that summer's eve
We stumbled in the dark and kissed beneath the stars

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris]
Wonder if it's possible to ever know
How many dreams I've cherished since that time ago
People only dream, when they close their eyes at night
But I'll open up my eyes, hey

[Chorus: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
Wonder if it's possible to ever know
All the skies I've journeyed through and touched before
(Touched before)
Some rely on fate
But it's not the only way
This is my destiny
And this is my will
(This is my will)

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
The sparkle in the night
Glitter in the sky
Each star we see tonight
Have all been here before
There really has to be
Some place nobody has seen
And there we'll start anew
Future for me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Memories illuminate in harmony
Like a constellation bound in unity
Tho they used to sing
So scattered through the sky
I recognize the beauty

[Chorus: Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Memories in circle all around me
Illustrating passage through this journey
Confirming my belief, this is no coincidence (No)
This is my destiny
This is my will
(This is my will)

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Horizons I have crossed in the past
Chapters in the story of my life
Oh oh oh oh, all the midnight skies
Are promising forever more
I'm reaching out to soar

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
I wonder if it's possible to ever know
How many dreams I've cherished since that time ago
See, people they only dream
When they close their eyes at night
But I'll open up my eyes, whoa-oh-oh

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
I wonder if it's possible to ever know
All the skies I've journeyed through and touched before
Some rely on fate, but it's not the only way
This is my destiny
Oh, this is my will

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 2. Frank Sinatra]
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Bridge: Swanson Quartet & (Frank Sinatra)]
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
(Let It Snow!)
Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow"
(I Don't Care!)

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra & (Swanson Quartet)]
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm... delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
(Let it snow!)

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]
When we've finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out In a storm
But If you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 2: All]
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

Baby, I don't wanna a soul
Hangin around my house when I'm not home
Oh, I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not home
I don't want you to open the door for nobody, woman
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone

Your sister might wanna visit us
But the little girl she talk too much
If she just come by to visit us
Tell her to meet us Sunday, Sunday, down at the church
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, baby
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone

Baby, when you're home and all alone

I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad, when times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass and let me do my stuff?

I know I got nothing on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad and you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass and let me do my stuff?

One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long, I've been tossed around enough
Oh, won't you just let me go down and do my stuff?

I know you're hoping to find
Someone who's gonna give you peace of mind
When times go bad, when times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass and let me do my stuff?

Do it, do it, do it
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah

And I want you to be my superwoman
Boy, I will be your friend forever
Well, go on and leave me that heart and you can get mine

'Cause all you need is my love

And through time my love will stay persistent, boy
All of me is what you're getting, let the world be the witness
Bad times, we'll work it out like fitness or re-live it

I see us in your chamber

Oh, it's a shake down
Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
There's 15 cars, and 15 restless riders
3 conductors and 25 sacks of mail

All along a southbound odyssey
And the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past the houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no names
And freightyards full of old grey men
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me, I'm your native son?
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels a rumblin' through the floor
And the son's of Pullman Porter's and the son's of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
And the days are full of restless, and the dreams are full of memories
And the echoes of the freight train whistles clear

Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me, I'm your native son?
Yes, I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when they day is done

But it's twilight on the City of New Orleans
Talk about a pocket full of friends
Halfway home, and we'll be there by mornin'
With no tomorrow waiting 'round the bend

Singin' good night America, I love you
Sayin' don't you know me, I'm your native son?
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me, I'm your native son?
Yes, I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when they day is done
I'm so cool I could be an Eskimo
Even in the summer at my house it snows
Ooh, I'm always chillin' like it's forty below
I'm so hot, I'm cold, cool kitty

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat

Meet me at the corner of cool and ice
Where all the girls hang out, you know the spots
The cars are fast and the motors are loud
If I were you I would be in the crowd, cool kitty, cool kitty

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Michelle, little girl I need you baby
More than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
My words you must believe

Well I need to see you laugh again
And I want to see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby
You're my only child

Michelle, little girl the pain for you
Is hurting me inside
At night I think of you sometimes
I lean my head and cry

I need to see you laugh again
And I wanna see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby
You're my only child

Michelle, little girl I need you baby
More than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe
My words you must believe
I need to see you laugh again
And I wanna see you smile
Michelle, little girl I love you baby
You're my only child

Michelle, little girl I need you baby
More than the air I breathe
My love for you grows stronger babe

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Settling along the scenery
Beneath the steady fall
The dusk accompanies a loneliness
Descending as snow
Tears can drown the embers
In this broken heart of mine
Another portrait in my life
Watching the seasons passing by

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Oh, crystallizing every breath I take
Even the subtle sighs
The wind carries a solemn melody
Through uncovered trees
At the red brick station
The trains can catch their breath
And I've been patient, waiting for someone
Who won't come back to me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Tonight the tears will go away
I'll find a way to play this Serenade
How can I break this song away from my emotions?
The snow is falling down to kiss
And help me reminisce and celebrate
My tears are falling from the sky and turn to White Love

[Verse 3: Shawn Stockman]
By the time the bells are swinging in their rhythmic symphony
Imagining a dreamy Winterland is where I will be
Angels all around, floating slowly from the sky
And bring a look of tendernes
Only the spring can show me how
So I'll be holding on strong
And keep from going on to loneliness
The glistening angels in the sky are waiting for me
And I will wish upon a star
And carry in my heart for foreverness
These tears eventually will frost and turn to White Love

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Hey

[Scatting]

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Tonight the tears will go away
I'll find a way to play this serenade
How can I break this song away from my emotions?
Give me one chance so I can shine
And reminisce the time and celebrate
My tears are falling from the sky and turn to White Love

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
White Love
White Love
Ooh, White Love, My Love, woo, woo
I just want to hold you
Can't be without you
I'm calling out your name
In my heart...
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
The world's a tiny blue-green ark
Afloat in darkest space
And every creature lives his time
And knows his special place
And each of us is Noah
With a life all in our care
To keep against the darkness
That's flooding everywhere

We've got to walk with the lion
Soar with the eagle
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace

The times have made us fearful
And our fears have brought the tears
The loneliness and darkness
Have grown bitter with the years
But a light is just beyond us
And the children almost see
A world that we've forgotten
And the world they want to be
When we walk with the lion
Soar with the eagle
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace

The ark is getting crowded now
And each of us must know
When everything is finished here
There's no where else to go
The beasts are here to bless us
And the faith is in their eyes
That we can find the garden
And see that sweet dawn rise

And we can walk with the lion
Soar with the eagle
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace

We've got to walk with the lion
Soar with the eagle
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace
You should have told me when it all began
You should have told me long ago
Someday I know you're gonna find
Just one mistake is not enough
To change my mind
What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again
And if the doubting faces made you go
It's only mine that matters now
Those looks will soon begin to fade
If you come back and show them all
You're not afraid
What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again
Now that you know how much I understand
You have no reason to be gone
And if you feel at all like me
Just let me know
I'll make it like it used to be
What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again...
Some time ago, I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there, I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright, and I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay, this was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico, and so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenes¡ meant "Please love me" and I could say frenes¡
A lovely senorita caught my eye, I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me, I gently sighed frenes¡
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine, her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine, so how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own, a greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone, who wouldn't say frenes¡?

B‚same tu a m¡, b‚same igual que mi boca te bes¢
Dame el frenes¡, qui mi locura te di¢, quien si no fui yo
Pudo ense¤arte el camino del amor, muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para m¡, y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti, b‚same con frenes¡
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar, y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar, que es mas que amor frenes¡
Hay en el beso que te di, alma, piedad, coraz¢n
Dime que sabes tu sentir, lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para m¡, y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti, b‚same con frenes¡

[Verse One]
Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
I tried to call been busy all night
Gave up waitin' at daylight

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me, if you wanted me

[Chorus]
I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

[Verse Two]
One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me, hey, hey

[Chorus]
I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

[Bridge]
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Takin' my own advice
I'm givin' up tonight, good luck to you and the king

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free if you wanted me
When, when you wanted me
Ohh, when you wanted babe

[Chorus]
I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as a man, you know life as a man
Livin' life as a man on the side
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy

The Virgin Mary had a baby boy
And they gave him the name of Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory

The wise men saw when the baby born
The wise men saw where the baby born
The wise men went where the baby born
And they said that his name was Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom

They saw the star over Bethlehem
That glorious star over Bethlehem
The trailed that star over Bethlehem
To the crib of the child named Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
They found a manger in Bethlehem
A lowly manger in Bethlehem
And in that manger in Bethlehem
They worshipped the child named Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
(Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
Let me go home

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?

[Verse 1]
My baby gives me the finance blues
Tax me to the limit of my revenues
Here she comes finger-poppin', clickety-click
She says, "Furs or diamonds, you could take your pick"

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Verse 2]
She say, "Money, honey", I draw a blank
I just drew my gun and mosey down to the bank
Knockin' off my neighborhood savings and loan
To keep my sweet chiquita in eau de cologne

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Bridge]
Mama, don't send me down to rob that bank again
I got a notion you're leading me to sin
Won't you relax, won't you lay way back
Don't you bug your honey 'bout no Cadillac
It's only bucks, you don't need no jack
So won't you please relax and lay way back

[Verse 3]
My baby's lovin' gives me such a thrill
It gives me inspiration makin' counterfeit bills
Now some folks say the best things in life are free
I sure don't get no lovin' livin' honestly!

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Verse 4]
Lord made a lady out of Adam's rib
Next thing you know, you got women's lib
Lovely to look upon, Heaven to touch
It's a real shame they got to cost so much!

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
She wants money (What she want)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money
I've traveled from town to town
Seems like everybody wanna throw me down
'Cause I'm a poor man
But I'm a good man, understand

I went down to the train station
Looked up on the wall
My money was too light, baby
Couldn't go nowhere at all
'Cause I'm a poor man
But I'm a good man, understand

The burden that I carry is so heavy, you see
It seems like there ain't nobody in this world
Who would wanna help poor me

Well, I would be all right, baby
Just give me a break
Good things come to those who wait
'Cause I've been a good man
But I'm a poor man, understand

[Intro: Nathan Morris]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
What Child is this who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, oh, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guardand Angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to serve Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

[Outro: Wanya Morris & Shawn Stockman]
Raise, raise a song on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone

Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again)

Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down the line
Well it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
(she's mine, all, all mine)

[Verse 1]
I know it sounds funny
But I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl
You know I've done all I can, oh yeah
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed
Oh, ooh...

[Chorus]
That's why I'm easy, oh yes
Said I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday morning

[Verse 2]
Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it (Paid my dues to make it)
Everybody wants me to be
What they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it
Whoa, no, woo...

[Chorus]
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

[Bridge]
I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know
The things I feel are right
I wanna be free
Oh, just me, oh baby, oh baby
Woo...

[Guitar solo]

Ooh...

[Chorus]
Ooh...that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
Because I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning
Oh, I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy, easy, ooh, like Sunday mornings
So easy, so easy, so easy
I'm easy, easy, ooh, like Sunday morning
So easy, so easy, so easy
I'm easy, yeah yeah yeah yeah, like Sunday morning
Ahh...ahh...morning
See the lights out on the water
Come and go, to and from
In the time it takes to find them
You can live, you can die
And nothing stops the river as it goes by
Nothing stops the river as it goes

All alone and all together
Every day, come what may
By the time we find each other
We can live, we can die
And nothing stops the river as it flows by
Nothing stops the river as it goes
Sh... shut up already, damn!

The chimes of time ring out the news, another day is through
Someone slipped and fell, was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength, your courage to renew
Do not be discouraged, for I have news for you

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in His light we'll never walk alone
Always feel at home, wherever you may roam
There is no power can conquer you while God is on your side
Just take Him at His promise, don't run away and hide

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
It is no secret what God can do
I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea;
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunadee
I miss the River Shannon and the folks at Skipparee;
The moor lands and the meadows
With their forty shades of green

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churning surf;
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean;
I'd walk from Cork to Lairn to see their forty shades of green

But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green
Prince
Miscellaneous
Intro
U're a trip and a half
I know those people say
They say U don't know how 2 love
But I want U anyway, baby, U're like a drug
I can't get enough cuz U
U'd be great in motion pictures, child
Cuz U really got me blind
U'd be the only one I wanna see
Only one that done it everytime
I'd do the do with U
U're like an ocean much 2 wide 2 cross
U are the cross that's much 2 deep 2 bear
U are the star much 2 far away
But I don't care, U're a trip and a half
I want U every day, hey!
Oooh, Winchester Cathedral, you're bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as my baby left town
You coulda done somethin', hey, you didn't try
You didn't do nothin', you just let her walk by

Now everyone knows just how much I needed that girl
She wouldn't have gone far away if only you'd started ringin' your bell

Winchester Cathedral, you're bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as my baby left town

Hey, Winchester Cathedral, you are bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as, you watched her go by, my baby left town
You coulda done somethin', but you didn't even try
You didn't do nothin', you didn't ding-dong, you let her get by

Now everyone knows just how much I needed that girl
She wouldn't have gone far away, if only you'd started ringin' your bell

Now, Winchester Cathedral, man, you've brought me down
You just stood there and watched as my baby left town!
Let me love you tonight, let me tell you how much I adore all your charms
Though you leave me tomorrow, for this night we'll borrow a love song
Let me love you tonight, let me thrill to the touch of your sheltering arms
Till the scent of the roses, caresses the sky and closes your eyes
Let me kiss you tonight, while the stars in the sky give a heavenly light
So, love is an ember, my heart will remember your sighs
Live a lifetime of love in a moment like this
Darling, let me love you tonight

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?

[Drop: Firebeatz & Rihanna]
What now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out
What now?
Please tell me
What now?

[Drop: Firebeatz & Rihanna]
What now?
Say what you wanna
Say what you please
It don't make no difference, baby
You're all right with me
I'm gonna keep on loving you, baby
I'm gonna keep on till the day I die
I keep on loving you
Baby, because the way you satisfy

I'm gonna tell you one thing
I'm not gonna say it again
The way I love you, baby
You know it's a doggone sin
Gonna keep on loving you
I'm gonna keep on loving you, woman
Baby, until the day I die, yeah
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Spoken Intro]
There's things I don't... wanna be misconstrued in my act that I feel often are. I don't want you leaving my show thinking that I think I know better than people, or that I think that I'm better than people in general, um. Okay, I just, wanted to put that out there. Uh, this is a song from the perspective of God

[Verse 1]
The books you think I wrote are way too thick
Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn't be a dick?
And I don't watch you when you sleep
Surprisingly, I don't use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep

[Chorus]
You're not going to heaven
Why the fuck would you think I'd ever kick it with you?
None of you are going to heaven
There's a trillion aliens cooler than you

[Post-Chorus 1]
You shouldn't abstain from rape just 'cause you think that I want you to
You shouldn't rape 'cause rape is a fucked up thing to do
Pretty obvious, just don't fucking rape people, please
Didn't think I had to write that one down for ya

[Verse 2]
I don't think masturbation is obscene
It's absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen
You make my job a living hell
I sent gays to fix overpopulation, and boy, did that go well

[Chorus]
You're not going to heaven
Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns
None of you are going to heaven
You're not my children, you're a bad game of Sims

[Post-Chorus 2]
You shouldn't abstain from pork just 'cause you think that I want you to
You can eat pork 'cause why the fuck would I give a shit?
I created the universe, think I'm drawing the line at the fuckin' deli aisle?

[Verse 3]
You argue and you bicker and you fight
Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night
Over what they think is true
But no one entertains the thought that maybe God does not believe in you

[Chorus 3]
You pray so badly for heaven
Knowing any day might be the day that you die
But maybe life on earth could be heaven
Doesn't just the thought of it make it worth a try?

[Bridge]
My love's the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it
You won't need it
My love's the type of thing that you have to earn and when you earn it
You won't need it

[Outro]
I'm not gonna give you love just 'cause I know that you want me to
If you want love then the love has gotta come from you

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you very much
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together was all gone
Lady, you've been dreaming, I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you our time has just begun

Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right here beside you
Today our lives were joined, became entwined
I wish that you could know how much I love you

Lady, are you happy, do you feel the way I do
Are there meanings that you've never seen before
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true
And it's like I've never, ever loved before

Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
Did you think our time together was all gone
Lady, my sweet lady, I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you our time has just begun
Must be a thousand million times I've seen your face in laughter
And ev'ry time meant something new to me
But being broke and living low
I sensed what you were after
And time has said ' get out before you bleed '

Oh , with every second glance , you killed my pride
And ev'ry second tear
You held my life in your hands
And you never knew of all the things you could do
If you wanted to

Too many looks in your eyes , breaking my heart
And I don't want to start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see , you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Too many looks in your eyes

I've often thought of things I'd do if I had money
But money's always been my dream to me
But ev'ry time I saw that face , those riches never mattered
To have you close was wealth enough for me
Imagination stopped , where life began
And I had always felt a little lost in your love with no way through
But you could pull me through if you wanted to

Too many looks in your eyes , breaking my heart
And I don't wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see , you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Too many looks in your eyes

With every second glance , you killed my pride
And ev'ry second tear, you held my life in your hands
And you never knew of all the things you could do
If you wanted to

Too many looks in your eyes, breaking my heart
And I don't wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see , you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Ah yeah

Too many looks in your eyes, breaking my heart
And I don't wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And it's easy to see , you're thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Ah yeah

When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name
Yes, when I first met you babe, I didn't even know your name
I was feeling so low on the ground
Bad luck and evil women was to blame

I never realized just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, I never realized, people, just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, but when I looked in your eyes
Yeah, I knew true love had come to me
Yeah

Take my hand, baby, now, you hold it tight and don't let go
Take my hand, now, hold it tight and don't let go
Yes, 'cause our love is like a merry go round
And 'round forever it's gonna go

[Verse 1]
I've been diggin' you for such a long time
You don't even know that I'm alive
Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind
Sorry but I'm sick of all this jive
Ok?

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout your body baby really get me hot
I'm sweating girl and it's all because of you
I don't want your credit cards or anything you got
Feel you up is all I wanna do
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up
Physical attraction babe
It's what it's all about
Hot and cold reaction
Feel you up
Turn you out

Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Verse 3]
What's the verdict? I don't like suspense
How can you resist my burning touch?
Something 'bout the way you walk just really blows my mind
I never wanted anything so much
Ok?

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I've been diggin' on you (for such a long time)
I've been diggin' on you
(I've been diggin' on you)
(I've been diggin' on you)

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up

Feel you up sugar sugar
Sugar sugar

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on

Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on

We don't like suspense
How can you resist my burning kiss

Feel you up, feel you up sugar sugar, huh

Let me touch your body baby come on
Let me feel you up

[Interlude]
I ain't looking for a one night stand
I only wanna feel you up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel you up
Physical attraction babe
It's what it's all about
Hot and cold reaction
Feel you up
Turn you out
I ain't talking 'bout earning nothing baby
I only wanna feel you up
Let me touch your body baby

[Chorus]
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel you up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
Yeah, let me feel you up

[Outro]
In time of trouble I'll be right there on the double
Whatever you want, whatever you need
Oh, baby, you can count on me
'Cause I'm a funky man, a funky man
I just wanna (Feel you up)
I just wanna (Feel you up)
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel you up
When sadness fills your heart
Sorrow hides the longing to be free
When things go wrong each day
You fix your mind to escape your misery

Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

How strange, your happy words
Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
How tears have filled the eyes
Of friends that you once walked among

Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

One grain of pure white snow
Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
In peace your mind withdraws
Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain
Your troubled young life
Has made you turn
To the needle of death

Your mother stands a-cryin'
While to the earth your body's slowly cast
Your father stands in silence
Caressing every young dream of the past

And your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To the needle of death

Through ages, man's desires
To free his mind, to releave his very soul
Has proved to all who live
That death itself is freedom for evermore

And your troubled young life
Had make you turn
To the needle of death

And your troubled young life
Had make you turn
To the needle of death
All day I face barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool Water
Poor Dan and I

We crossed the dry
And so I cried
Cool water
Cool clear water

Keep moving Dan
Don't you listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water

Dan don't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
Shadows sway

They seem to say
Tonight we'll pray for water
Cool water
Way up there
You hear a prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool clear water
Keep moving Dan

Don't you listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan don't you see that big green tree

Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
All day I face the baron ways
Without the taste of water

Cool clear water
Cool clear water
I'll know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, is your love
How deep is your love, I really need to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools, breakin' us down
They should all just let us be, we belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think that I care for you
Well, you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love, is your love
How deep is your love, I really need to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools, breakin' us down
They should all just let us be, we belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, is your love
How deep is your love, I really need to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools, breakin' us down
They should all just let us be, we belong to you and me

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?

[Intro]
Can you come outside and play?

[Verse 1]
Give me your name and number
And give me the keys to your ride
Put the top down
Let me cruise up the ocean side
Let me put my arm around you
Unsnap your self-consciousness
Take off everything except your stockings
I wanna kiss you more or less

Can you come outside and play? (Play)

Da, da da, da da da, da da da da
Woo
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What's up, baby? Oh
I'm coming to get you
Ooh love love love love love
I'm taking you places, oh
Showing you things, check it out

[Verse 1]
Girl, you say you need a man that's gonna take good care of you
Someone who's gonna do you right and be true to you
Well I'm the type of man that's gonna give you what you choose
Hey baby, I got news for you

[Chorus]
Love is on the way, girl, oh babe
Got what you want and I'm gonna give it to you
Love is on the way, girl, oh babe
Giving you what you need and keeping you happy, oh

[Verse 2]
Say you're tired and you need someone that's gonna take you away from here
Say he's got to be that man who's gonna take you everywhere
Well grab your clothes, baby, 'cause we're out of here
Hey lady, I got news, my dear

Love is on the way, girl, oh babe
Got what you want and I'm gonna give it to you

Love is on the way, girl, it's on the way, yeah
Anything your heart desire, girl, I'm gonna give it to you
Love is on the way, girl
Love is on the way, girl

[Verse 1]
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone, growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry
Dry, dry

[Chorus 1]
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry, oh

[Verse 2]
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To hide the beckoning of hatred
Oh, what rise, baby skin
Throws back her head to scream her sides
The woodland shades its eyes
To such a strange event

[Chorus 2]
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're not just sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's tragic
You seem to lose
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
Don't throw your heart to the prowling moon
Don't wait too long for the prowling moon
Why do you stay here for so long

[Outro]
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun

Here's to the winners, lift up the glasses
Here's to the glory still to be
Here's to the battle, whatever it's for
To ask the best of ourselves then give much more

Here's to the heroes, those who move mountains
Here's to the mountains they make us see
Here's to all brothers, here's to all people
Here's to the winners all of us can be
John Henry he could hammer
He could whistle, he could sing
He went to the mountain early in the mornin'
Just to hear his hammer ring, Lord, Lord
Just to hear his hammer ring
Just to hear his hammer ring, Lord, Lord
Just to hear his hammer ring

When John Henry was a little baby
Sittin' on his daddy's knee
He picked up a hammer, a little piece of steel
Said hammer be the death of me, Lord, Lord
Said hammer be the death of me
Said hammer be the death of me, Lord, Lord
Said hammer be the death of me

When John Henry's fam'ly needed money
Said he didn't have but a dime
If you wait 'til the red sun goes down
I'll get it from the man in the mine, Lord, Lord
I'll get it from the man in the mine
I'll get it from the man in the mine, Lord, Lord
I'll get it from the man in the mine
Well John Henry went to the Captain
Said the captain, what can you do
I can hoist a jack, I can lay a track
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too

Well the captain said to John Henry
Gonna bring me a steam drill 'round
Gonna bring me a steam drill out on the job
Gonna whup that steel on down, Lord, Lord
Whup that steel on down

Well John Henry said to the captain
Oh a man ain't nothin' but a man
'Fore I'd let your steam drill beat me down
I'd die with my hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord
Die with my hammer in my hand

Well John Henry said to the captain
Looka yonder what I see
Hole done choke, drill done broke
And you can't drive steel like me, Lord, Lord
Can't drive steel like me
Oh no, you can't drive steel like me, no no
Can't drive steel like me
Well John Henry drove into the mountain
His hammer was strikin' fire
He drove so hard he broke his poor heart
And he laid down his hammer and he died, Lord, Lord
Laid down his hammer and he died
He laid down his hammer and he died, Great God
Laid down his hammer and he died

Oh they took John Henry to the White House
And they buried him in the sand
Every locomotive come roarin' by
Says there lies a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
There lies a steel drivin' man
Says there lies a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
There lies a steel drivin' man

Shaker why don't you sing
I'm throwin' twelve pounds from my hips on down
Just listen to the cold steel ring
Just listen to the cold steel ring

Well the Captain says to John Henry
I believe this mountains cavin' in
John Henry said to the Captain
'T ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind
'T ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind
The man that invented the steamdrill
Thought he was mighty fine
John Henry made his fifteen feet
The steamdrill only made nine
The steamdrill only made nine

Well John Henry had a little woman
And her name was Polly Ann

[Verse 1]
I don't know what your folks got against me, girl
But I do know that I want you permanently in my world
What's age or color or money when you love one another?
I know you keep saying to me, 'Our love will win and then you'll see.'

[Chorus]
But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day
So you and I can be free, oh baby
To share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives making love
Morning, noon, and night

[Verse 2]
Take the wings from a bird and don't you know it can't fly
If they take your love from me, I will surely die
Don't get lost in all they're saying
Games are all that they're playing
I know you keep saying to me, 'Our Love will win and then you'll see.'

[Chorus]
But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day, girl
So you and I can be free, oh baby
To share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives making love
Morning, noon, and night, baby

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby
True love is a once in a lifetime thing, my dear
We can't let what others think about us destroy what we share
You said 'We can take the rejection
We can build a wall of protection.'
I can feel the pressure closing in all around us
Girl, don't let them destroy our love

[Chorus]
But baby, sail away with me
Where you, girl, and I can be free
We're gonna share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives
Making love morning, noon and night
Baby, sail away with me
Where you and I can be free
Girl, we're gonna share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives
Making love morning, noon and night
Baby, sail away with me
Where you and I can be free
Can't wait another day
We're gonna share our love under the stars above

I've seen the look - of a baby with a rattle
I've seen the look - of a hero in a battle
I've seen the look - of a heart sick turtle love
But the look that leaves you real shook - is the look of love

I've seen the look - of a jockey on a winner
I've seen the look - of a fat man having dinner
I've seen the look - of those space men up above
But the look that closes the book - is the look of love

It's thunder, it's lightening
The gentlest breeze
It's friendly, it's frightening
And more surprising than an elephant's sneeze

I've seen the look - every single blushing bride has
I've seen the look - that the fellow by her side has
But there's one look - that I'd give my life to see
We are locked in a wondrous embrace - and there on that fabulous face
Is that fabulous look of love - for me
(That's what I want to see)
(That look of love for me)

[Verse 1]
Where are you going my little one, little one?
Where are you going my baby, my own?
Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four
Turn around and you're a young girl going out of the door
Turn around, turn around
Turn around and you're a young girl going out of the door

[Verse 2]
Where are you going my little one, little one?
Little dirndls and petticoats, where have you gone?
Turn around and you're tiny, turn around and you're grown
Turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own
Turn around, turn around
Turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own

[Outro]
Where are you going my little one, little one?
Where are you going my baby, my own?
New york city is a thousand miles away
And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's ok
Now I'm not trying to put the big apple down
'Cause they don't need a man like me in town
I pick cotton down on the dixie line
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
But that's allright, that's ok by me
'Cause that's the way that it was meant to be

Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

I don't like smoke chokin' up my air
And some of those city folks well they don't care
I don't like cars buzzing around
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine, fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
That's all right, each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Well, I don't want to even read about it

Let me tell you something, let me tell you true
What's right for me might not be right for you
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine
And I hope that your happy all the time
I pick cotton down on the dixie line
Work hard all day tryin' to make a dime
But that's all right, that's ok by me
'Cause that's the way that it was supposed to be

Big city, hard times never bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Let me tell ya, I said
Big city, hard times never bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be
Ooh, that's my way, baby
I don't want you to even tell me about the big city
I don't want to read about it
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?
You took all my money and you done me wrong
Staying out all night baby and you won't come home
Oh baby, why can't you treat me right?

Oh baby, you know my love is true
Oh baby, you know my love is true
I do everything you tell me to
You won't do anything baby but try to make me blue
Baby, you ought to treat me right

Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Oh baby, you're gonna reap just what you sow
Someday baby, you gonna learn that
If you play with fire you're gotta get burned
Baby, you better treat me right

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 2]
You, you, you got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Bridge]
'Cause it sure seems (It sure seems) you got no doubts (No doubts)
But we all see (We all see) you got your head in the clouds

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (Under my arm)
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now shit has got them dancing like I channel open fold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still f*cked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a f*ck
You know I gotta give a f*ck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear thee tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass ain't black enough
What the f*ck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch is blazing
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't f*ck with these niggas cause this swag is asinine
I don't have time to eat
I don't have time to sleep
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
Yes I'm in the building
No I own the company
Your girlfriend's sister... you cannot f*ck with me
Childish Gambino
We are all children
I am just a murderer
We have just killed them
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man

Hey white boy, what you doin' in town
Hey white boy, chasin' all the women around
Oh pardon me, sir, it's the last thing on my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man

Big dirty building, up three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man

I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Waiting for the man

To welcome me home

[Intro]
Whoa, yeah
Oooh

[Verse 1]
Baby, please, you don’t have to explain the reasons
This is me, I know your mind can change like the seasons
Go your way, I know the world is calling your name, boy
It’s okay, 'cause what we got, it ain’t gonna change, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
As long as we’ve been together
You’ve always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

[Chorus]
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

[Verse 2]
You and me, we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying too hard to play cool
I don't mind, I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time, sometimes the heart rearranges

[Pre-Chorus]
As long as we’ve been together
You’ve always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

[Chorus]
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
(Can't find your way back home)
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone (You're all alone)
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)

[Bridge]
There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder, boy, and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there, right there

[Chorus]
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothing
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?
Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt, I was walkin' into World War III
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say
He said, "It was a bad dream"
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though
They were my own dreams
And they're only in my head
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch"
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, "Tell me about it"
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wonderin' who turned the lights on us
Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wonderin' which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parkin' meter
And walked on down the road, it was a normal day
Well, I rung me fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
"Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man"
Shotgun fired and away I ran
I don't blame 'em too much though
They didn't know me
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man, I said, "Howdy friend
I guess there's just us two"
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a communist
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
Say, "Let's go and play Adam and Eve"
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, "Hey man, you crazy or sumpin'
You see what happened last time they started"
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun'
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down 42nd street, in my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
Well, I remember seein' some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn't work so well
Turned on my player
It was rock-a-day, Johnny singin'
"Tell your ma, tell your pa
Our loves are gonna grow ooh-wah, ooh-wah"
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
"When you hear the beep, it will be three o'clock"
She said that for over an hour and I hung it up
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin', "Hey, I've been havin' the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
I didn't see you around"
Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody's havin' them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walkin' around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
"I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours"
I said that
Are you going to Scarborough Fair:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

On the side of a hill in the deep forest green
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine

On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves
Washes the grave with silvery tears
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

Tell her to find me an acre of land:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine
War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
General order their soldiers to kill
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Well, I wake up late in the afternoon
I eat my eggs with the evening news
And the sun's gone down 'fore I find my shoes
Music fills the air, but it's all the blues

And she won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away

Well, we got no heat and the window's broke
The storm rains came, everything got soaked
And there's no bread left, nothing here to smoke
Then the Lord looks down sayin' can't you take a joke?

And she won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away

The palm tree's just a picture on a postcard
The ocean's just a memory in my dream
Then a man comes the T.V. selling soap suds
To dirty up my rivers and my streams
Like a mystery movie without an end
When you think it's over, it just begins
It's not always true that the good guy wins
I been down so long that I got the bends

And she won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away
Let's have Christ our President
Let us have him for our king
Cast your vote for the Carpenter
That they call the Nazarene

The only way
We could ever beat
These crooked politician men

Is to cast the moneychangers
Out of the temple
Put the Carpenter in

Oh it's Jesus Christ our President
God above our king
With a job and pension for young and old
We will make hallelujah ring

Every year we waste enough
To feed the ones who starve
We build our civilization up
And we shoot it down with wars
But with the Carpenter
On the seat
Way up in the capitol town

The usa
Be on the way
Prosperity bound
Wake up, it's a beautiful morning
Honey, while the stars are still shining
Wake up, would you like to go with me
Honey, take a run down to the beach

Oh momma, I wanna go surfin'
Oh momma, I don't care about nothing

Wake up, there's a new kid in the town
Honey, he's moving into the big house
Remember when I was so very hopeless
Darling, he's gonna make it all better

Oh momma, I wanna go surfin'
Oh momma, I don't care about nothing

Down down baby down by the rollercoaster
Sweet sweet baby I'll never let you go
Down down baby down by the rollercoaster
Sweet sweet baby I'll never let you go
Down down baby down by the rollercoaster
Sweet sweet baby I'll never let you go
Down down baby down by the rollercoaster
Sweet sweet baby I'll never let you go

Oh momma, I wanna go surfin'
Oh momma, I don't care about nothing
Oh momma, I wanna go surfin'
Oh momma, I don't care about nothing
Like the folks you meet on
Like to plant my feet on the Brooklyn Bridge
What a lovely view from
Heaven looks at you from the Brooklyn Bridge

I love to listen to the wind through her strings
The song that she sings for the town
I love to look up at the clouds in her hair
She's learned to wear like a crown

If you've been a rover
Journey's end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge
Don't let no one tell you
I've been tryin' to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge

All the folks in Manhattan are sad
'cause they look at her and wish they had
The good old Brooklyn Bridge

Instrumental
If you've been a rover
Journey's end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge
Don't let no one tell you
I've been tryin' to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge

You'll miss her most when you roam
'cause you'll think of her and think of home
The good old Brooklyn Bridge
From the highest tower, I will call you home
It's the same old story, love will find it's own

You come to me, conspiracy of the night
The heart that you want just happens to be mine
Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains
But you wind up on my side, and what will be will be

That you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit
The face of a friend invisible on the street
If you're battling to be mine, I'm victorious in defeat

And I surrender, I surrender

Anybody want me, anyone know my name
Do it in a lifetime, you be dust and the soul survives
Evens up the score

From the highest tower, I will call you home
It's the same old story, love will find it's own
And I surrender, take me for all time
Love that lasts forever, I surrender

We are elite, prisoners of the night
We fight to the finish and savour the delights
It's your body that got me beat, and I'm crumbling at your feet
I surrender, I surrender

You're the air that I breathe

I will walk through fire, keep you safe and sound
In the final hour, turn my life around
And I surrender, take me for all time

You're the air that I breathe

This is my life story, I've been lost and found
In the final hour, turn my life around

And I surrender. take me for all time
Love as warm as wine, and I surrender

Take me for all time, love that lasts forever
The beginning vocals were slowed down but with the words in front of you, you can understand them!!!

'star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. over'
'I am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun. over'
'you mean it's the earth? over.'
Positive. it is know to have some form of intelligent species. over'
'I think we should take a look.'

Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silken seas
Your mysterious mountains
I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine

Although your world wonders me
With you majestic superior crackling hen
Your people I do not understand
So to you I wish to put and end
And you'll never hear surf music again
Your love is like a a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, and hard to hold

Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone, and it hurts so much

Well and why...
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry?

Well now you think of love as
Sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you
Started to roll it down
Because once you start it
You can't make it stop

I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live
Well and why...
Must the same love that made me laugh...
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?

Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow
Just cryin' like a weeping willow

Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?

Why you wanna make me mess in my pillow
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow

Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Baby, please don't be angry with me
Honey, because I'm goin' away
Oh, please don't be angry with me, baby
Because I'm goin' away
I told you all about your mistakes, baby
But you didn't hear a word, not a word I said

I'm tired, so tired of worryin'
Baby, I don't know just what to do
Hey, I'm tired, I'm so tired of worryin' now
I don't know just what to do
Oh, I'm sorry for you, baby
But you know I just, I just can't put up with you

Oh, I tried to please you, baby
But you know you just weren't satisfied with me
Oh, I tried, fell hard to please you
But baby, you weren't satisfied with me
I'm gonna let you go now, baby
'Cause now you know, you just want to be free
Go ahead now
Are your garments all spotless?
Are they white as the snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

Is your soul all spotless?
Is it clean as the snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

I am washed, yes I'm washed
I am washed in the blood
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb

I'm all clean I'm all spotless
I'm all pure like the snow
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb

Have you laid down your burdens?
Have you found peace and rest?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

I've laid down all my troubles
I've found peace and rest
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
Have you learned to love your neighbors?
Of all colors, creeds and kinds?
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

I've learned to love my peoples
Of all colors, creeds, and kinds
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb

I am washed, yes I'm washed
I am washed in the blood
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb

I'm all clean I'm all spotless
And I'm pure like the snow
I'm all washed in the blood of the lamb
You know it hurts so much
C'mon and please me
You know I need your tender touch

Love me like a hurricane
And then you start to ( ? )
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
Love me like a hurricane
And then you start to ( ? )
I'll give it to you straight right now

Please

Oh please don't tease me
You know it hurts so much
C'mon and squeeze me
You know I need your tender touch

Tell me that you love me babe
Then you say you don't
You tell me that you'll come on over
Then you say you won't
Money, power, and respect
Keep my foes in check and
Kill every motherf**ker that be after my neck
Lets get it straight it dawg
Im hot, ur not
I take ur bitch ass and drop it like it hot
Ur style is messed up and ur flow is wack
The way u be rappin, u must be on crack
Goin against me dawg
Ur ass must be crazy
'cause I lay ur ass to sleep
And then roca bye baby
Ur just an amateur but
Me, im a veteran
After im done with u
U goin need an ambulance
Now let me stop
Take a breath before I really get pissed
On second thought, f**k it im already pissed
Hey yo, this is a lyrical assault on
Anyone who wants some
I knock u out with one verse
Like I'm mike Tyson
Im like a reptile, homie
When I spit, its venom
First, I cripple ur ass
Then I go get em'
U don't want it with me
Trust me when I say so
When I come around bitch
Ur ass better lay low
U walkin with ur bitch
And im like hold up shorty
Look at the way ur man looks
He must be homophobic
Then after a minute or so
She turns at me and
What does she say
Damn ur right, he really does look gay
And that's when u get dumped
Lookin like a prick
While ur bitch is chokin
With her mouth on my dick
Now u can lean back motherf**ker
But I ain't fat joe
Its dre on the hook and
Im killin u hoe
Now before I go
Im goin give u this (middle finger)
'cause this ain't no song
This a motherf**kin diss
My blood is mixed
My mother was ungumpai picani, my father was habsoluca
This mixture was not respected; as a small boy I was often left to myself
So I spent many months stalking the Elk people, to prove i would soon become a good hunter
One day finally, my Elk relatives took pity on me, and a young Elk gave his life to me
With only my knife, I took his life
As I was preparing to cut the meat white men came upon me, they were English soldiers
I cut one with my knife but they hit me on the head, with a rifle
All went black; my spirit seemed to leave me
I was then taken east, in a cage
I was taken to Toronto, then Philadelphia, and then to New York; and each time I arrived in another city, somehow the white man had moved all thier people there ahead of me
Each new city contained the same white people as the last, and I could not understand how a whole city of people could be moved so quickly
Eventually, I was taken on a ship across the great sea, over to England, and I was paraded before them like a captured animal, an exhibit
So I mimicked them, imitating their ways, hoping they might lose interest in this young savage, but their interest only grew
I was copying them so they placed me into the white mans school
It was there that I discovered, in a book, the words that William Blake had written
They were powerful words and they spoke to me
So I made careful plans and eventually I escaped
Once again I crossed the great ocean
I saw many sad things as I made my way back to the lands of my people
Once they realized who I was, the stories of my adventures angered them
They called me a liar
Xebachae-he who talks loud saying nothing
Ridiculed by my own people, and I was left to wander the earth alone
I am Nobody
I know I said that I was leaving
But I just, couldn't say goodbye
It was only self decieving
To walk away from someone
Who means everything in life to you

You learn from every lonley day
Ive learned and Ive come back to stay

Let me try again
Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all
You and I again
Just forgive me
Or ill die
Please let me try again

I was such a fool to doubt you
To try and go it all alone
There's no sense to life without you
Now all i do is just exist
And think about the chance ive missed
To beg is not an easy task
But pride is such a foolish mask
Let me try again
Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all
You and I again
Just forgive me
Or ill die
Please let me try again
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you, tonight
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just a friend of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Ooh baby why you wait so long
Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come home, come home

I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord I won't miss you child

Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Lord, I miss you child

Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah

Yes, baby

[Verse 1]
In the summer of his years
He would always smile
He would laugh every day
If he was here to stay
For the summer of his years

[Verse 2]
In the daylight of his dreams
He would save his tears
He would always hear
When there was no one near
For the summer of his years

[Verse 3]
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
For the summer of his years
For the summer of his years
I've had many times I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me cryin'
I thought I'd had my share of that
But these Miss You Nights...

Midnight diamonds stud my heaven
Southward burning like the jewels that line her place
And the warm winds that embrace me
Just as surely kissed your face
Yet these Miss You Nights
Are the longest

How I miss you
I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man, and the cold daylight
Buys the pride I'd rather sell
All my secrets
Are a wasted affair
You know them well
Thinkin' of my goin'
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind
Looking moonward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives

(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killin' time
(Play down) Play down all dreams once remembered
It's just the same, this miss-you game

These Miss You Nights
Are Forever (They're forever....)

[Verse 1:]
Although the sun has been around for a long time
Still has the ability to shine
And although the moon lights up the night
Sometimes it likes to hang out in the sunshine
Although green grass sometimes turn brown
It's refreshed when rain drops come falling down
Creations starts and it's renewed
By a single touch from you

[Pre-Chorus:]
So, I depend on you know matter what I do
I know that you'll always come though
You never change the rules
I can depend on the always-ness of you

[Chorus:]
Never change you'll remain
Faithful through life's ups and downs, still the same
Everlasting love for me so heavenly
That's the always-ness

[Verse 2:]
The seasons change without a calendar
And the breezes knows how and when to blow
Never have to wonder where the water goes
Cause it flows home to the
