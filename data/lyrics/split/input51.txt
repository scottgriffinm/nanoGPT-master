It's like I flicked a switch and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could (Bounce)

When the waking comes I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

I can love again tonight, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
(Bounce

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that

[Intro: sample]
Fury
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Ain't I clean? That machine, super cool, super mean
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

[T.I talking over the Chorus]
Yeah, so
You already know, hey
I'm the hottest nigga you done heard in a long time
Introducing you to the hottest nigga you heard in a long time
Hey

[Verse One: T.I.]
Mega pimp, super clean, the coolest in the universe
Niggas hating on what he doing just mad cause they ain't do it first
His name pop up when you hit play or on your Google search
Bitches bow they head and bend they knees just like they do in church
Drop doe into her purse before you get into her skirt
She agree to do the work before she get into the vert
Till my pine box drop down into the dirt
I'm a be by far the hottest nigga, known to the Earth
In the air, I fly, can't compare my
Swagger to another rapper, don't you dare try
Anyone with a pair of eyes can look and see
No legacy will ever be next to me or near by
Though I invite you all to try, hey, I'm a fair guy
Just approach with caution, be aware because I don't share my
Throne, my crown I own
Hottest flow on any song, I'm on, I'm gone, nigga

[Break: sample]
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

[Chorus]

[T.I talking over Chorus]
Hey! B.o.B, you up next, baby!
Hey! Grand Hustle, nigga!
If I ain't the hottest nigga on the universe
I guess I'll have to do until he gets here, nigga!

[B.o.B] Here I go!

[T.I.] Hey Call me a lie, nigga! Yeah

[Verse Two: B.o.B]
I'm that nigga that you heard about through word of mouth
They probably say I change the music in the dirty south
Now that the word is out, the timing is perfect now
To take all of these hypocritical rumor and burn em down
If you observe the doubt, you'd see what they worried about
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
Honestly, I could give a fuck what you're blurting out
Point, blank, I'm in the game rocking my jersey now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time
Whether on Greg Street or 107.9
Or on your favorite rap blog on your rap website
And if that ain't right, then show me straight to the judge
Just like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs
Venomous blood in my veins, chemicals up in my brain
Yes I resemble a criminal, B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fucking with mayne

[Break]

[Outro: T.I.] + (B.o.B)
Okay, you got that (I'm gone, mayne
I kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)
Hehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man
I ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)
Ay, man, aye man that laughing, that laugh is natural
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
I mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin
That the likes of the second verse can even
Slightly compare with the immaculate (Hahaha)
Then I must take a chuckle...Hahaha
You know what I'm saying, but never no mind
(We can have em blog about it)
Absolutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge
(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)
B.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog
(Which could be the better acronym for the song)
But you know what either way it's Grand Hustle!
Hahahaha (Ah-haha)

[Chorus until fade]
Chris Martin :
This is probably the best song ever written And he's the best singer in the world, Mr. Richard Ashcroft. Ok, here we go:
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah
You know I can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?
Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds
That recognize the pain in me, now
I let the melody shine
Let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet yeah
You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?, Ooh
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
My life
Your life
Their lives
Come take it down the only road I've ever been down
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
This life, this life, this life...
Thank you . .

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong?
I went to the doctor guess what she told me
Guess what she told me
She said boy you better try to have fun
No matter what you do
But she's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state
Swimming on a sea of faces
The tide of the human race, and so
An answer now is what I need
I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon, oh
Come on love, stay with me

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
La da da da da da da da da da, hey yeah, ooh

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
Your body's warm, but you're still unsure
I'll have you know that I have the perfect cure, yeah
Step in my room and I'll take your fears away
Put your trust in me and all that I say
Tell me can we lay

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & R. Kelly]
Let's lay together
Ooh hoo baby
Let's lay together
Tell me can we lay
Let's lay together
Lay ay ay ay, yeah, oh baby
Let's lay together
Ooh, oh hoo oh hoo

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
Heaven's to blame for this love affair
Feels good to know love will always be there, baby
You took my heart and made such a sexual burning flame
Let's love tonight, straight into the day
Can we lay

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & R. Kelly]
Let's lay together
Please baby
Let's lay together
Oh, all I wanna do is lay
Let's lay together
Let's lay together
Let's lay together
Let's lay together

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Ah, please, baby
Lay down, baby
Let me help you with your stockings, girl
Yeah, oh baby
All I wanna do, all day and night, all day and night, baby
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & R. Kelly]
Let's lay together
Can we lay? Can we lay? What can I say? Can we lay?
Let's lay together
Ah, together, me and you, me and you, me and you, girl
Let's lay together
Me and you, girl, ah, nobody
Let's lay together
Nobody else, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody else around
Let's lay together
Nobody, baby - we can go to town
Let's lay together

[Outro: Ronald Isley & R. Kelly]
Yeah, well well well, I can make your body sing, baby
Ting a ling a ling, ting a ling, ting a ling, baby
Well well well well, ooh hoo hoo hoo
Can we lay? Can we lay?
Let's lay together
Can we lay? Can we lay, baby?
Let's lay together
Ah, ah, put your head on my shoulder, baby
Let's lay together
Right there, right there, girl

[Spoken Intro]
All their windows were dark
And no one knew he was there
All the Whos were all dreaming
Sweet dreams without care

[Verse 1]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel

[Verse 2]
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a
Thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

[Interlude]
All I need is a reindeer
So he took his dog Max, and he took some black thread
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head
Then the Grinch said, "Giddyup!"
And the sleigh started down toward the homes where the Who's lay a-snooze in their town!
"Oh yeah! This is stop number one!"
The old Grinchy Claus hissed as he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch
But if Santa Claus could do it, then so could the Grinch
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant
Around the whole room, and he took every present
Popguns, panpoolers, pantookers, and drums
Checkboards, bisslebigs, popcorn, and plums
And he stuffed them in the bags
Then the Grinch very nimbly stuffed all the bags, one by one
Up the chimney

[Verse 3]
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk
Mr. Grinch
The three best words that best describe you are as follows
And I quote:
Stink!
Stank!
Stunk!

[Verse 4]
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a noxious super nos
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked horse
Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce
Hey, get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes, and get goin'
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

A little shoe-shine boy he never gets low-down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town!
Bending low at the peoples' feet
On a windy corner of a dirty street

Well, I asked him while she shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoe-shine rag, and he said

Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your troubles from your worried mind
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes, and get goin'
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Well, I had to listen to the shoe-shine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy!
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoe-shine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said, you're a mighty little boy to be a-workin' that way!
He said I like it, with a big wide grin
Kept on a-poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

[Verse 1]
A wanna be gangster thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be confusion proof
Pudding's sweet but too aloof
Orange eye girl with a backslide dew said
Yo homie, who you talkin' to?
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One uppercut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
Add a little lust to the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race just lose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some?

[Chorus]
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me why I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly in my third eye
Searchin' for a soul-bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk, I fall into my new ride
My hand, my hand
Magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face like a stage in Vaudeville
I feel so good can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum rockin' my red hood

[Chorus]
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

[Guitar Solo]
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..

When I was just a baby my mama told me "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns."
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me...

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away...
We call him Yella, he is the best
He rocks the house on the DMX
When he's on the beatbox, he cannot miss
So listen to the beat, as he rocks like this...

Yes, Yella is his name, and he's created
The big beat sound, so devastated
Party people in the place, you beware of the shock
'Cause Yella (Yella) Yella is on the beatbox, huh!

To feel the beat, it's time for you
To rock with the devastatin' Wreckin Cru
You got snare, hi-hat and bass in your face
So come on Yella boy, let's wreck this place, huh!

The headlines read "We are in Town"
The World Class Cru is gonna throw down
We are here, and here to stay
And we came to raise hell, and not to play
As we grow stronger, you get weaker
Sucker MC put your ear to the speaker
There is no doubt that we are best
We don't have to scratch just to make the beat fresh
The beat will blast and we'll outlast
There is no other that's in its class
It's not a 808 or a Drum-you-lator
It's a DMX and it is greater
It makes a sound that's so unique
Huh! To rock your butt and move your feet
Now sucker MC's we will impress
'Cause Yella (Yella) Yella on the DMX, huh-huh!
Party people in the place, we're not through
We're gonna show just what we're gonna do
So listen up close and don't miss a word
'Cause it is the hardest rap you ever heard
Like a blast from heaven, a blaze from hell
Who's comin' on the mic? Well, it's Cli-n-tel
So sucker MC's, you better beware
'Cause I will be your next nightmare
Yes, I am fresh, the MC wizard
When it comes to cold raps, huh, I'm a blizzard
Well, I'm the genius, the mastermind
Super def creator of MC rhymes
So come a little closer and you will see
Who? The Cli-n-tel's in the place to be
Now comin' on the mic without delay
A little "Bom bom bom"... It's Dr Dre
I'm the physician who's gonna start dishin'
All them things that you've been missin'
If it's for answers that you have been fishin'
Take a bite of this for your nutrition
I'm the real doctor, that is final
All you other suckers are made of vinyl
I won the election to issue injections
To who? Sucker MC's who wish for perfection
Next in line there's Lonzo
Producer of the groove, grandmaster of the show
The head debater, there is none greater
Because he is the Cru's creator
You put us all together, you've got the best
While Yella throws down on a DMX, huh-huh!
I’m tired (tired)
So tired (so tired)
Of chasing the dreams (of chasing the dreams)
With tears in my eyes
I realize
That it’s running away

It’s running away

But with all the wrong I’ve done
How could love ever love me?
(??)
But it's not much to say
Not much to say

So please, please, please, help me
Is there some kind of sign?
Please, please, please, please, please
I want, need, somebody, somebody
I want someone to be mine
Please, please, please, please, please

The man in the mirror
Oh, he won’t even look at me
Well, you may not believe it, but my own reflection
Told me I ought to be ashamed of myself
(Told me I should be ashamed of)
Oh, yes it did (myself)
I’ve wasted my time (my time)
My mind (my mind)
My energy

On the bed

Cuz don't nobody love me yet

Sometimes I got the mood for for love
I say mmmm
Hello this is Dr. Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return

Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town
And I was wondering, do you make house calls?

Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything
Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring
Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said hello
It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo

[Chorus]
Cuz I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home

It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three
Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery
Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine
But all they had was Thunderbird 1979
So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then
Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said come in
Opened the door to see what I got from this house call
Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole

[Chorus: 2x]
Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with wavy hair
The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care
So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone
Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone

[Chorus: 2x]
Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return

Dre, this is Rene. Do you take American Express?

Dre, this is Alicia. You know what the mood is

Yo Doc, Lonzo, Two jaccuzis free. Bring yo trunks

Yo, it's me again. About those trunks. Forget 'em

Yo Dre man, wassup, huh? Cathy's back in town

Dre, I think (inaudible) knows about us

Say fool, you left ya driving license over here last night
Now I'm a have to whoop yo ass
Now, this here's the story of the Rock Island Line
The Rock Island line, she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big toll gate down there
And, y' know, if you got certain things on board
When you go through the toll gate
Where you don't have to pay the man all toll
Well, the train driver, he pulled up to the toll gate
The man only asked him what he had on board, and he said
"I got livestock, I got livestock
I got cows, I got pigs, I got sheep, I got mules, I got all livestock"
Well, he said, "you're alright, boy
You don't have to pay no toll
You just go right on through"
So, he went on through the toll gate, and as he went through
He started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned a look back to the man, he said
"Well, I fooled you, I fooled you
I got pig iron, I got pig iron
I got all pig iron"
Down the Rock Island Line is a mighty good road
The Rock Island Line, it's the road to ride
The Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
Well, if you want to ride you gotta ride like you find it
Get your ticket at the station of the Rock Island Line

It was cloudy in the west, looked like rain
But round the corner come-a passenger train
North-bound train on the south-bound track
You were all right a-leavin but you won't be back

Well, the Rock Island Line is a mighty good road

Well, if you want to ride you gotta ride like you find it
Get your ticket at the station of the Rock Island Line

Now I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Well, the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks he'd like to have tried
The doctor asked him "what could they be?"
He said "a hot cup of coffee and cold glass of tea"

Well, the Rock Island Line is a mighty good road
The Rock Island Line, it's the road to ride
The Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
Well, if you want to ride you gotta ride like you find it
Get your ticket at the station of the Rock Island Line

Woke up this morning I looked 'round for my shoes
You know I had those mean old walking blues
Hey what a good, what a good eye, trying to ride blind
Hey ? train, ain't no friend of mine
Leavin' this morning, I had to go ride the blind
I've been mistreated and I don't mind dying

He-he-hey

(oh, sorry!)
I've been around the world, seen everything
And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

I've loved in sunshine, I've loved in the rain
All of the women who know me call that loving man
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues

Some people go to school to try and learn their trade
Yes, but I'm a lover, a lover by nature
That's why I know, I know, I know I've got it made

Yes, you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun
But they tell me the reason I'm the king
I'm a lovin' son of a gun
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
(Welcome to the world, welcome to the world)
You got your pop star, I'll be your rock star
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions won't stop
You get your fifteen, and then they take the spot
Lets go, lets go and then you're ready to go
Lets go lets go 'cause it's the end of the show
Lets go lets go so just get ready to go
Lets go lets go, lets go lets go

[Chorus]
All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world
She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination
Lets go, lets go and then you're ready to go
Lets go lets go 'cause it's the end of the show
Lets go lets go and when its over, you'll know
Lets go lets go, lets go lets go

[Chorus]
Life's a tour, I'm so sure
The ex so pure before you exit girl
No more games, I confess
Far from lame I'm just so fresh
Who but me? It's the big boss
New kid on the block, Mr. Rudolf (Kevin)
Two stars, hold your applause
I hold it down he holds all guitars
Half my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight
New chicks, get my drinks up
Every weekend we can link up
New rings, with the pink cuts
You'll need a passport, get your Minks up
Took my turn she love it, each touch
And when she closes her eyes this what she thinks of, Boss

[Chorus]
Welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Oh I pity the fool

That falls in love with you

M, that falls in love with you
I pity the fool

She'll break your heart one day
Then she'll laugh and walk away
Oh I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I said I know you're wondering
What they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Oh I pity the fool
I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
I pity the fool

Yeah, I pity the fool
I pity the fool
That falls in love with you

She'll break your heart one day
Then she'll laugh and walk away
Oh I pity the fool, oh yeah
Look at the people
Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing

Look, they're just standing there
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Tell me again, man

Look at the people
Look at the people
I know you're wondering
What they're doing

Look, they're just standing there
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

[Biz + P. Diddy]

[Intro: Biz Markie, P. Diddy, & both]
And you don't stop, and you can't stop
Yeah, yeah, I like this
If you, if you
Wanna know, wanna know
The real deal, about the Biz
A-say what, a-say what?
Well I'm the Biz Markie
And I'm the P. Diddy
So you know what time it is
A-come on
If you, if you
Wanna know, wanna know
The real deal, about the Biz
A-say what?
And that's comin from me, the P. Diddy
And you know what time it is, RIGHHHT

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
So come on Diabolical
Don't stop and don't you dare quit
Just get on the mic, sit on the mic
Spit on the mic and don't you dare quit!

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
When I get on the mic, I guarantee
There's no better MC than Biz Markie
Everything I say, or anything I do
Will move yo' posse or your crew
When you me hear me say, and what I play
Affects a lot of people in the strangest way
Well I'm too cold to freeze, too hot to burn
And I never miss a tag when it's my turn
'Cause I can rock the mic if you give me a chance
Cool V'll cut the record, make you do the 'Biz Dance'
I can flip the crowd with a wave of my hand
I'm the Diabolical, "And you know this MAAAAAAN!"

[Chorus]
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
I'm the court jester, the manifester
I used to buy my clothes at A.J. Lester's
The rhymerator, the beat creator
Whack rappers get dropped like a hot potato
The dime repeater, the MC greeter
Knuckle bleeder, no need for a heater
The only MC in history
Who didn't even have to R-A-P
The bum destroyer, I'm comin' for ya
Got took to court and didn't need a lawyer
Make James Brown get down (Yeah, yeah)
Made Beretta go get her (Yeah, yeah)
Made Laverne and Bill Cosby (Yeah, yeah)
Go change their sweaters (Yeah, yeah)
I fought Mike Tyson, dropped him in 4
Went to Fort Knox and kicked down the door
Rocked seven continents with all this flow
"And this is somethin' for the radio"

[Chorus]
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone

[Verse 4: Biz Markie]
Got ladies screamin' "STRANJE STRANJE"
With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
If rap was sex, I'd be a porno star
With Sade, and Janet, in a menage-a-trois
Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema
Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Like Robin Harris, "I gotta go, gotta go!"

[Chorus]
You can do your thang (you can do your thang), and any-thang you choose (any-thang you choose)
But please, please, leave my thang alone (leave my thang alone)
You can do your thang (you can do your thang), and any-thang you choose (any-thang you choose)
But please, please, leave my thang alone (leave my thang alone)
You can do your thang *oh, come on*, and any-thang you choose (and any-thang you choose)
But please, please, (please) leave my thang alone (leave my thang alone)
You can do your thang (leave my thang alone), and any-thang you choose (and any-thang you choose)
But please *I like this*, please, (please) leave my thang alone (leave my thang alone)
(You leave my thing alone, yeah, oh-woah-oh-woah)

Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time each year
Ooh ooh

Well, way up North where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled, we call it ol' Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's ol' candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick little Saint Nick
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer ah
Run run reindeer

Run run reindeer we don't miss no one
He's hauling through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with a-Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Ah ooh
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time each year
Ah ooh
Merry Christmas Santa
Christmas comes this time each year!

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go

If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go

Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor
And just dance for me
Just be here ain't no joke
So stay here till we're closed
Stay up on the floor
And just dance for me
Leave all your struggles and your cares behind
Don't you worry bout a thing not tonight
Don't drink too much
Because we have all night
Don't you rush because it's all night long
If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me (dance for me)
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me (ohh dance for me)
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor
And just dance for me
Just be here ain't no joke (dance for me)
So stay here till we're closed
Stay up on the floor
Just dance for me (ohh)

[Verse 2: Common]
While ladies shake they thangs, brothers chains swang
Dancing is a ritual we used to maintain
Whether steppin' or crip walkin'
Over music, shit talkin
Hard times get softened in spots we hit often
Off in a loft, basement party or a strip club
Good times, good wine, gotta skeet to trick dubs
It's up to you, I ain't gon' tell you where your hands should be
Like the ghost of Marvin, come on and dance for me
If you flowin real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed (dance for me)
This whole week got you messed up (dance for me)
Get on the floor (dance for me)
And just dance for me (dance for me)
Just be here ain't no joke (dance for me)
So stay here till we're closed
And stay up on the floor
And just dance for me

If you dope and real hot (come on, come on)
And you feelin the vibe (come on, come on)
Won't you get on the floor (come on, come on)
And just dance for me (come on, come on)
If you feelin the groove (come on, come on)
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up

[Verse: Walter Williams Sr.]
Took me a while, but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)

[Chorus: Walter Williams Sr.]
Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shinin on me
(no no no no no)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
Loves me

[Verse: Beyonce + Choir]
I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions (they share)
They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)

[Chorus: Beyonce + Choir]
Seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me (but I want to be for you)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me

[Bridge: Choir]
I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, cuz I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)

[Verse: Choir + Beyonce]
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame

[Chorus]
Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
Cuz I ain't good enough, but you still love me

[Bridge]
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but (tryin my best)
It ain't good enough (I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed (I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
(child sing with me)
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but it ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word (Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
Cuz I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough, but He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough (How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too)
But He still loves me (even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough (you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me (no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (but the Lord still loves me)

[Intro]
And he think I don't know

[Verse 1]
I don't know what gets me more
'Bout your two hour trips to the store
How they never have what you went there for
Yet you say to trust you more
Or is it the fact that you believe
That your girl is just so naive
But the one thing I can't deny
Is what I saw with my own two eyes

[Chorus]
And he think I don't know

[Verse 1 repeated]
I don't know what gets me more
'Bout your two hour trips to the store
How they never have what you went there for
Yet you say to trust you more
Or is it the fact that you believe
That your girl is just so naive
But the one thing I can't deny
Is what I saw with my own two eyes

[Chorus]
And he think I don't know
He must think I'm stupid
He think I don't know, oh
And he think I don't know
He think I don't know, oh

[Verse 2]
On my way to work one night
As I made a left at the light
See, what I saw just wasn't right
Yes, what's done in darkness gon' come to light
But if you won't tell, I won't tell
Just let me leave before I go to jail
And the thing that blows my mind
Is that he walks around like shit is fine

[Chorus]
And he think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
He must be crazy
He think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Oh, and he think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
He must be stupid
Think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
He (Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Oh, he think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
He must be crazy
He think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Oh, he (Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Ah, he think I don't know

[Outro]
He think I don't know, oh
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Yeah yeah

Ooh, think I don't know

Hey hey hey
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Oh oh, how could you think I don't know
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
How everything you do you do with me every night, yeah yeah
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
When you're with me, everything, everything, oh
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Hey hey
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Oh, how could you think I don't know?
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
You must be stupid, stupid
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Hey, hey
(Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
Oh oh

He (Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
He (Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)
He (Think I don't know, think I don't know, think I don't know)

[Verse 1: Eve]
I used to give you too much power
Trust me, them days is over
Can't understand how I
Let you sit on my shoulders
Them times when you messed up
I made excuses for
And I always knew it, that I should have headed for the door
But I stayed and you played the right way in your place
And I prayed every time you was away you'd see my face
But the me was you, and your pain was mine
And the same situation playing over in my mind
It seems

[Verse 2: Mary]
Ain't tryna hear you
Just tryna hear me
Don't wanna hear nothing, baby, it's selfishly
I blaming you for the hurt in me, but it's not your fault that
I'm so incomplete

[Pre-Chorus: Mary]
It see every time I do it do it I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love (Falling in love)
And it's affecting how I'm breathing
Affecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon, loving you is hardest
And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the sink
One thing I found is

[Chorus: Mary]
I had to take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Ay, see, I can't leave you until I learn to leave me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me me

[Verse 3: Mary]
What was I thinking?
That you could talk to me like that
You was holding me down, but I was holding me back
Looking inside myself, and has to see who I am
'Cause this is my trial, affecting my smile
I gotta walk it out, it's gonna be a while

[Pre-Chorus: Mary]
It see every time I do it do it I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's affecting how I'm breathing
Affecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon, loving you is hardest
And I can't take no more (Take no more)
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the sink
One thing I found is

[Chorus: Mary]
I had to take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Ay, see, I can't leave you until I learn to leave me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me me

[Verse 4: Eve & (Mary)]
Everything I thought I knew
All them times I ran away
It seems really I was running from me (Running from me)
I know constantly we tried, we was living in a lie
Finally looked into mirror to see (Mirror to see)
Probably would have left you sooner, but I was being scared
And that ain't how I ever should be (Never should be)
Yeah, I was searching for a while for the source of the problem
One thing I found is

[Chorus: Mary]
I had to take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Ay, see, I can't leave you until I learn to leave me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me me

[Outro: Mary]
Take a look in the mirror (Take a look in the mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Oh oh)

[Verse 1]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Verse 2]
I asked for a sign
From my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No, I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
(Every day I wanna cry)
But if I give you one more try
To these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right?

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(I said I wanna be happy)
All I really want
Is to be happy (Oh, I wanna be...)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(To find a love that's mine...)
All I really want
(...oh, it'll be so fine)
Is to be happy (Wanna be happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(It would be so sweet...)
All I really want (...if only we could be...)
Is to be happy (We can be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (I wanna be happy)
It would be so sweet

[Bridge]
I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah yeah yeah
Now let it breathe

Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time?
Help me sing it

All I really want is for me to be happy
(Ohhh, just help me sing it)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah)
All I really want is for me to be happy

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
(I don't wanna have to worry about nothin' no more)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
(Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(Said I wanna be happy if it's all right with you and me...)
All I really want (...it'll be all right with me)
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
(Won't you help me sing, just help me sing it)
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
The answer took some searching for
But you think you understand

With the lights still off
Our clothes still on the floor
And your head in your hands

You say she's holding you back
And bringing you down
You're all out of reasons to stick around
It's time to think of yourself
In spite of her tears
And break your vow of so many years

Well don't get me wrong
I like what I hear
And even if it's true
I have to ask
'Cause I wanna be absolutely clear
Just what am I to you
Oh I'm your light in the dark
Your breath of fresh air
The love of your life
The answer to all your prayers

No, I am just your long way home
I know it, you'll know it soon
I am just your long way home
You're welcome

That morning the day had finally come
For somebody to lose
You kissed me hard and walked out of my door
To give her the bad news

But I followed you there
Like the sick fuck I am
To see what she'd do when you said goodbye again

She opened the door
She opened her arms

And you fell into them like a baby
And there from my car
I became your long way home
I knew it, you know it now
I was just your long way home
I knew it, she knows it now
I was just your long way home
You're welcome
You're all I need to get by
Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you

I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're All I need to get by
I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door

Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, You're All I need to get by

I all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by
Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Who finds the money
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven-sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

(Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba ba-ba-baaa
Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba baaa ba-baa ba-baa
Wa-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
Wednesday morning papers didn't come (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba baaa ba-baa ba-baa)
Thursday night your stockings needed mending (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Well if the same thing happened to you
Would you still put me through what you put me through?
If it happened to you. What if it happened to you?

[Verse]
I'm going to Chicago; that's the last place my baby strayed
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)
I'm packing up my bags, going to leave this old town right away
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)

Got no money in my pocket so I'm going to have to hitch hike all the way
(All the way) Yeah (Hitch hike baby)
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Now what'd I say
Come on, hitch hike (Hitch hike baby)
Come hitch hike Jenny (Hitch hike Susan)

[...and fade]
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Go on take 'er, I don't need 'er
Kickin' back in my 2 seater
I'm through with ya, I don't remember
Nothin' 'bout ya, amnesia
I moved on, adios
Pop your bottles, make a toast
Whole pockets, filled up
Nothin' but dead folks
You thought that I was gonna save you
Tried to play but I played you
Louie V, D&G
Look at your wheat which I made you
I'm cold hearted, no feelings
My McLaren got no ceiling
Fast life, can am
On 85, three wheelin'
Panamera, new Ferrari
Paint job, caucasian
Two hoes, half asian
Two mo', Venezuelan
Through with ya, now kick rocks
S1's in my tick tock
10 bricks for this wrist watch
It's over babe, straight drop
What the fuck?
Heyo Whoo Kid, run that shit back
God damn
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Go on take 'er, I don't need 'er
Kickin' back in my 2 seater
I'm through with ya, I don't remember
Nothin' 'bout you, amnesia
I moved on, adios
Pop your bottles, make a toast
Whole pockets, filled up
Nothin' but dead folks
You thought that I was gonna save you
Tried to play but I played you
Louie V, D&G
Look at your wheat which I made you
I'm cold hearted, no feelings
My McLaren got no ceiling
Fast life, can am
On 85, three wheelin'

Paint job, caucasian
Two hoes, half asian
Two mo', Venezuelan
Through with ya, now kick rocks
S1's in my tick tock
10 bricks for this wrist watch
It's over babe, straight drop
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Money money money man
I got DC's, crockodiles
On both feet, Kai Peters
Livin' life, screwed up
Jump lane for 100 meters
You spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies
But that's bullshit, I'm too fly
My heart cold, I don't feel
Nothin' in it, it paralyzed
You can have her, I cut 'er off
She ain't know how to treat a boss
I move pounds like Boston George
Get high before I was record
Mark Jacobs on my face
Gator heads on my waist
Makin' more, B-O-T
I pop the trunk but there's lil space
Goin' in on everything
Head first, divin' for it
You playin' games, changin' numbers
And I ain't got time for it
Drop the top, I need head room
Flat screens in my bathroom
I got red hoe' with long weave
With Money Man on they tattoos
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Ai-ain't in love with him, blood sucka
Bleed his Pockets, then burn rubba
You can look, never let him touch it
Think about it all day Mothafucka
Run over niggas, road kill
Need room to breathe like fish gills
Give them to you? What's the use
Give them away, goodwill
High heels, TG's
Got that ass movin' in 3D
The riding cure everything's so Breezy
Gotta fight him for me like Rhi Rhi
Black Frost, heart cold
Third eye, heart froze
Oblivious, tagged toes
Beauty and the beast, don't love hoes
That shit, I don't like it
Do anything for a Klondike
Ice-cream but my ice clean
And my cake feels, bon appetite
Devious, French too
Bitch cost, whole thang
Twenty cake in my bustier
38 in my villa rang
Consider this Evil Empire thing as a threat
Well I was talking last night
Magneto and Titanium Man ...
We were talking about you, babe
Oo --- they said ---

You were involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three
In the main street

I didn't believe them
Magneto and Titanium Man ...
But when the Crimson Dynamo
Finally assured me, well, I knew

You were involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three
In the main street

So we went out
Magneto and Titanium Man ...
And the Crimson Dynamo
Came along for the ride
We went to town with the library
And we swung all over that
Long tall bank in the main street

Well there she were and to my despair
She's a five-star criminal
Breaking the code

Magneto said "Now the time come
To gather our forces and run!!!"
Oh no ...
This can't be so ...

And then it occurred to me!

You couldn't be bad
Magneto was mad!
Titanium too!
And the Crimson Dynamo
Just couldn't cut it no more
You were the law ...
"Go on spit it out there is no such thing as a stupid question."

"What does your brain smell like?"

"OK now THAT'S a stupid question."

Your Brain is divided into two hemispheres
Your left controls your right side and your right controls your left side
And they're both tied together in a neat little package
By the totally awesome Corpus Callosum
When you peel away that meninges layer
Wipe off that cerebro-spinal fluid
And you're looking right at the four lobes of the brain

(You all know what I am talking about, Say it with me now)
Frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital
And each one's got a very special job, yeah
Each one knows exactly what to do
As you're watching my disembodied head
Your rods and cones are sending their stimuli to your thalamus
Which joins up to your occipital lobe
(Which of course processes visual information)
As you're listening to these words right here
The vibrations of the scillia down in your ears
Are sending those impulses along to your temporal lobe
And I know right now you're probably thinking
"Al. how can these different parts of the brain
Communicate with each other?"
Well to answer that question
I'm gonna have to break it down to a microscopic level

This is a neuron, a funky funky neuron
You got your axon on the one side
You got your dendrites on the other
See the dendrites receive the signal from another neuron
Which sparks a chemical reaction in the nucleus
Creating a nerve impulse which travels down a long long myelin-coated strand

Through which the neurotransmitter molecules enter the vesicle of the axon terminal
And as neurotransmitters jump a millionth of an inch
Across the synaptic gap
And smash into the receptors
Of the dendrites of another neuron
Connecting neuron to neuron to neuron to neuron
All across your entire brain (Oh Yeah)

The more you use your brain (your brain)
The more connections you're gonna make
And the smarter, the smarter you're gonna be (dup doowah)
I'm talking bout your brain (dup doowah)
You gotta hand it to your brain (dup doowah)
Yeah yeah that's your Brain
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Ooh, ooh
Round and round and round
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Ooh
Round and round and round
You're my baby and I love you
You can take a pound of love
And cook it in the stew

When you've finished doing that
I know what you want to do
'Cause you're my baby and I love you

I'm your baby; do you love me?
I can drive a Cadillac
Across the Irish sea
But when I've finished doing that
I know where I'll want to be
'Cause I'm your baby and you love me

Spirits of ancient Egypt
Shadows of ancient Rome
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Hung on the telly
Hung on the telly
Hung on the telephone
You're my baby, I know you know
You could sell an elevator
To Geronimo
And when you've finished doing that
I know where you'll want to go
'Cause you're my baby, I know you know

Spirits of ancient Egypt
Echoes of sunken Spain
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Hung on the phone
A-hung on the phone
A-hung on the phone
Again

[Chorus Akon]
Don't look no farther!
Baby im back (yeah)
Im here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to do: ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)

[Baby Bash]
Now im back in a flesh
Feelin so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, im back in your zone
Baby im back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can't lie i'm on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of lake ariba
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
These words comin out the speaker, true love is off the meter

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute but now im home
Please forget me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone tell them squares to leave u alone
Let me spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I keep it so saucy and I get respect
You don't have to look no fartha, you dealin with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no fartha, you hotter then a fire starter

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh) 

[repeat x4]
Now im back let me hit it (oooohhh) 

[repeat x4]

[Chorus x2]
Chorus:
I wanna be bigger, bigger than the fame
Bigger than the lights, bigger than the money
Out on the stage
I wanna be bigger, bigger than it all
Bigger than the glory, so I could never fall
Bigger than the sky, bigger than the clouds
We never coming down

I'ma, bit bigger like david taking goliath
Just trying to get my voice steady screaming out through the silence
This industry makes me resort to violence
'Cause I've been kicked around too long, stuck these vice grips
Plus, when nobody supports you, they pirate
So there's no money left to make the next of my hits
Other rappers ignoring me, now on my list
'Cause I've been keeping track of the dust left on my kicks
Ugh, and ya'll are bound to see
I'm out to be much bigger than all those surrounding me
While you're dreaming of stars, I reach for galaxies
If you're doubting me, keep on, I'm bound to be
Chorus:
Ii wanna be bigger, bigger than the fame
Bigger than the lights, bigger than the money
Out on the stage
I wanna be bigger, bigger than it all
Bigger than the glory, so I could never fall
Bigger than the sky, bigger than the clouds
We never coming down
(I'mma be bigger, yeah
Say I'mma be bigger, cool!)
Oh, ah oh, oh ah oh

So big, these haters here must stop
'Cause you talk a big game, but I learn to trust not
Been doing it long enough and I've had enough stops
So I'll do it 'till I make it or until my lungs pop
Here so watch out, until I grow old and I'm a wash out
I'mma be the biggest thing shining, so pull your watch out
Forget a platinum record, I'm bigger than first or second
I'm larger than premadonna's, all you snakes and anaconda's
Not finished with my sentence, no period, put a comma
This thing is running on, my message just getting longer
There's a sauna burning up, with this world against me
I'mma be the biggest thing that you ever did see
So much so much love
So much
So tell me can you feel it?
So much so much yeah
You know
Then make that visit
So much so much love
So much
Senegal can you feel it?
So much so much yeah
So much

[Chorus:]
So much love to share
Pure blackness, wantness is so rare
So much love to care
Let them know they're missin' out
Mama Africa
So much love to share
Sweet blackness, oneness
Meet me there
So much love to care
Let them know they missin' out
Sing again
A
This is for all the love
And the life took away
F
Don't forget we were bought and trade
R
Ripped from the land and shipped away
I
Is the inspiration we use to survive
C
Have to see it with your own cries
A
No play add it up and arrive

Still you don't know
The land is so gold and green
The place is so fresh and clean
And everyday I water my garden
Tell me if you feel it deep in your heart
Visit once, guaranteed to visit twice
And if you just believe in the most high
I know you'll be all right

[Chorus]
A
That's my favorite place when I need to get away
F
Must forget but we can't forget to pray
R
Like Lance ridin' on the runway
I
In my homeland and I'm feelin' so alive
C
Imagine Africa unite
A
Gonna accept mass alright
Still you don't know
Skin is so dark and brown
She lifts me right off the ground
But no you not gonna see it on you TV
So just listen up and believe me
Her trees have the only cure
Her love is so new and pure
Had to kiss them troubles goodbye bye
No I don't have to lie
Mama Africa, unite

[Chorus]
So much so much love
So tell me can you feel it
So much so much
Then make that visit
So much so much love
Senegal can you feel it
So much so much
Ow!
So much love to share
I just can't see how we're livin' without it
So much love to care
Don't miss don't miss one moment about it
So much love to share
Resist this bliss though I really doubt it
So much love so much love to share
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
A
Is for ambition our dream we envision
F
Is for the fear we gon provoke when we vicious
R
Your smart enough to recognize my plan
A mystery become some history then change it damn
C, how we
Don't 4get how could we 4get Africa da motha land
Damn I thought you spanned
Had a peice beyond average for her I'm a savage
Property to lavish my life style is iight now
We'll do this don't stop
All the seed is like a fire, like a fire
Show no sympathy
I'll be way upon the mountain
Lying down for me
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
When my hand lifts up for me
Not to mean the flair
Got them always darkle flame me
Higher like flair
Momma know that I will leave
'Cause that's what I provided
Every day I get raised
And live by the sun
All the seeds like a fire like a fire
Show no sympathy
I'll be way upon the mountain
Lying down for me
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
Seems there is no sympathy
Or no mercy for the wind
What surrender all retreat
I'll make you remember me
And for those who want to kill me
Know exactly where to find me
Down in a concrete jungle
Like I don't care like I ever pleased
Don't tell me
I hunted miles and running
Never bad gun on a hard blood coming
I'll tell her relook stunning
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
I am so high upon the mountain
Can't find the way but don't
Watch me flow the step of fountain
Sadly does a girl
I'll the loft to kill me
Then let me kills evils
'Cause I'm a junker I'm a hero
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
'Cause I am a survivor, survivor
I'm a survivor
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
Really, really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you
I must really like you
'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time

Oh baby, baby, baby
It's getting kind of crazy
'Cause you are taking over my mind

(Chorus)
And it feels like oooooh
You don't know my name
I swear, it feels like ooooooh
You don't know my name
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

Oh! Baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
Doing everything that makes me smile
When we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh it set my soul on fire
Oooh Baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild
(Chorus)
It feels like oooooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it baby, it feels like ooooooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doing to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like, Oh!
Doing nothing I've ever done, for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of me
'Cause did I mention (oh!) You bout' to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels
To have, all my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience, my lovin (oh!)
'Cause my lovin feels like

(Chorus)
Oooooh
You Don't Know my name
And I swear it feels like
Oooooooh
You Don't my name

Will you ever know it?
I'm going to have to go ahead and just call this boy
Hello, can I speak to..to Michael
Oh hey, how ya' doin'?
I feel kinda' silly doin' this, but uh
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
(Chuckle) you know the one with the braids?
Yeah
Well I see you on Wednesday's, all the time
You come on every Wednesday on your lunch break I think
You always order the special, with the hot chocolate
Look man I mean, I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wonderin'
If maybe we could get together outside the restaurant one day
You know, 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
(Chuckle) Wait a minute, my cell phones breakin' up
Can you hear me now?
Yeah, so what day did you say?
Oh, Thursday's perfect
(Chorus)
And it feels like oooohhh
You Don't Know My name
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Oooooooh
Oooooooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Will you ever know?
You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Think (think-think) let your mind go
Let yourself be free

Let's go back - let's go back
A let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you

But it don't take too much I.Q
To see what you're doing to me

Think about what you're tryin' ta do to me
(What you're tryin' to do to me)

Woo-hoo, think (think)

[Verse 1]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees

Ha hah hah, hah hah, oh
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

(Akon)
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way

(Flashy Verse 1)
How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another
Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother
That's what happens when that man is from the gutter
And that man is a hustler trying to survive, moving grams of that butter
See, his momma was a dope fiend, poppa was a rolling stone
He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home
Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown
'cause ever since twelve years old he was on his own
And even though it seemed like school was the best plan
His only choice was distributing the rock like Def-jam
While everybody else was getting diplomas
He graduated from the middle of the strip to the corner
But I don't knock him cause he tryin to bubble
There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles
And I ain't sayin that its right to be dealin
All I'm sayin is I feel him I guess
I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know
(Akon)
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way

(Flashy Verse 2)
Now baby girl's got a promising future
But her moms passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser
He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward
He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard
And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her
But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her professor
It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester
And the only means of making it better was totally reversing the role
Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down its hurting her soul
And even if it meant taking off her clothes
She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals
And I ain't trippin off a-how shortie livin
She gotta pay her tuiton put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin
And I ain't sayin I agree with her job but shit times is hard
I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you know

(Akon)
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
(Flashy Verse 3)
Now see the moral of the story is this
If you ain't tryin to help stop our troubles then don't knock our hustle
Cause really at the end of the day its not ya'll struggle
But you always got something to say
Well hear this fuck you
Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds
Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes
Look at the world from our view try to live by our rules
Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our schools
I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll probably try to end it all
And hang yourself or bang yourself
You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt
And without folding your hands play the games we dealt
I'm being real I ain't tryin to be evil
Look how we live, look how ya'll live
C'mon be serious how is we equal
Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time
I'm finished writing this rhyme
Ya'll never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know

(Akon)
How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day
Stay down stay down just to live a better way (Repeat 2X)
(feat. Dirt Bag)

(1st Vrs)
Hmmmmm-Mmmmm x2(Yeah)
Must be nice
Having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Having someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

(Chorus)
Even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those 20's stop spinning
And all those gold-digging women disappear
She'll still be here
(2nd Vrs)
Must be nice
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice
Having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone
Must be nice
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

(Chorus) x4
Listen, all around the world, the people crying, can't find somethin' to believe
They put so much faith in people who are lying, they're so easy to deceive
Ain't no mystery, you know the words to set you free, there for all the world to see
When you got it on your side, there's no reason left to hide, you got to give it to receive
Yeah the message is love

[Chorus]
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above (uh-huh-uh)
(Tell everybody) Tell everybody (yeah-hey) what your dreaming of
That love is the message and the message is love (oh-oh)

Deep in every heart, there's an answer, what will it take to make it real
Leave and console my wall of confusion, still can't tell you what you feel

Hey, yeah, Why must it be the sign of something burning in the night to make us
Hunger for the day
Oh, there ain't no mystery, just love enough to let it be
Everybody knows the way, yeah, the message is love

[Chorus]
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above (uh-huh-uh)
(Tell everybody) Tell everybody (yeah-hey) what your dreaming of
That love is the message and the message is love (oh-oh)
Can you hear the sound, must be the ear-ear-ear-earth spinnin' 'round
We're gonna find out, just what the world, just what the world is all about
The message is love

[Chorus]
Love is the message and the message is love (yeah)
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above
(Come on and tell everybody) Tell everybody what your dreaming of
That love is the message and the message is love

[Chorus]
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above (uh-huh-uh)
(Tell everybody) Tell everybody (yeah-hey) what your dreaming of
That love is the message and the message is love (oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Love is the message and the message is love
From the streets to the mountains to the heavens above (uh-huh-uh)
(Tell everybody) Tell everybody (yeah-hey) what your dreaming of

[Chorus]
Love is the message and the message is love

[Intro: Pitbull]
I Know Ya'll Listen To My Music (Redd Eyezz) But What I'mma Do Know Is Try And Describe My Life To Ya'll

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Sometimes I Fell Like I'm Loosing It
My Life Is Upside Down
A Gift And A Curse That's My Life Now
There Is No Looking Or Turning Back
I Used To Watch Coke Turn To Crack
That's What Made Me Turn To Rap
I Fell Like Keanu Reeves In The Movie Devils Advocate
Confused But Blessed With Extravagance
I Thank God For All The Opportunities
Given The Opportunity Dem Boys Would Put Two In Me
We Live In The Land Of The Free, Hustlers And Thieves
I Made Money Now I Got Uncle Sam Hustling
Me For A Quarter Of What I Make
Hand A Quarter Sentence To A Fake
And Watch Them Turn State (That's Right)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Most Of These Fools Are Characters
Men With No Character Welcome To America
Where We Fight For Freedom
If Ain't About Oil Than We Don't Need Them
Ain't That The Truth?
Pitbull I'm Just Tell Ya'll The Way I Fell
Thank God That God Made Me To Keep It Real

[Hook: Pitbull]
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Until The Fed's Step In (That Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Fame Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till Dem Bitches Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)
Blood Is Thicker Than Water (At Least They Say It Is)
Till That Money Step In (That's Just The Way It Is)

[Verse 2: Red Eyezz]
Huh Hun Yo
After The Turf War The Smoke Clears
All These Years Around These Busta
I'm Convinced There Ain't No Hope Here
In The Past Four Years Of My Lifetime I Witness Leaders Sacrifice Freedom Just To Get This Pipeline
Guess I'm Chosen At The Right Time Mama Stress
Facing The Table And She's Snorting Up White Line
Blood Is Thicker Than Water
In A Few Cases Your Daughter Can Have Touched For The Money That In Dem Suit Case
Tighten My Shoelaces The Fugitive Running
In Fear Of A Criminal Past 'cause Dem Folks Is Coming
I've Been Wrongfully Judged Being From This Environment
The City Gangs Planning Retirement
I'mma A Dade Nigga
Voicing My Set 'cause A Spray Quick
Took Some Of The Same Steps Through Little Haiti As These Main Nigga (Like Who) Hit Man, Big Dogg, And Shehound
Ya'll Predict It Back Then Shit I See It Know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I Escape Poverty (Poverty)
I Don't Own Jewelry Motherfucker I Own Property
You Can Send Dem Tsunamis That Hit Indonesia (But But But)
Ain't No Motherfucking Thing Stopping Me
Like Good Coke I'm A Good Swimmer God Knows I Done Lost But God Dam I'm A Good Winner
It Feels Great To Make Something Out Of Nothing Yea I'm Humble But I Tell Ya'll To Push A Chico's Buttons
And Watch How Them Thing Get To Dumping
Real-Estate New York Game Now You Saying Something
I Only Talk About What I Know About
Illegal Turn Legal This Year That's What I'm All About
I'm From The South And I Ain't Gonna Lie
At Fist Time I Preach Ye Till God Struck Me With Pride
I Was Confused Now I'm Like Let's Ride
305 Till I Die
305 Till I Die

[Hook]

Well, let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc
And let your spine unwind — just take a risk
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn
(Now)Tell me party people, is that so wrong?
The ship is docking, interlockin'
And up-rockin', electro-shocking
We're getting down, computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
Now all of y'all, get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Ooo
Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bonbon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body-rockin', not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

[Chorus]
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike D, with the master plan
I said, Ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am
And when I grab the mic, you scream, "Ooh, goddamn"
The crème de la crème is who I am
MCA, where have you been?
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place
And if you pull my card, you pull the ace
And if you ask me, turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace... So

Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would (Okay)

Okay, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, vulture
Dummy avoider, record-breaker
Won't ya
Give credit where credit is due, Don't ya
Know that I don't give a number two

Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one
I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men in Black I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to

What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles

Shaking that booty to the "Do the Brown" song (Do the Brown)

Ain't never gonna trust you no
Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while your droppin' like oh oh oh oh

Bend over baby come over and get these crispy dubs

No le hagas caso daddy

Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda

Don't make me lose my cool babe

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

Transhypnotic robotic can't stop it
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket

Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back

I'm the king of Boggle there is none higher
I get 11 points off the word Quagmire
Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it cause that's my biz

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright
Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
Deny, till we die, ooh my my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply

Second by second and minute by minute
It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes

So tell me what you need that you have got
Feeding on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along

We're all connected like a Leggo set
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try to come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked
I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like, hello nasty where you been
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon

I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit 'cause it just makes me strong

Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

Si e' verdad que tú ere' guapa yo te vo' a poner gozar
Tú tienes la boca grande, dale, ponte a jugar (¿Cómo?)
One, two, three, four
Uno, do', tres, cuatro

[Intro 1: Pitbull]
Picture that with a Kodak

[Intro 2: Pitbull]
Me not workin' hard? Yeah right
Picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Nayer]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know
We might not get tomorrow, let's do it tonight
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what
Don't care what

[Refrain: Pitbull]
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Picture that with a Kodak
Picture that with a Kodak
Picture that with a Kodak
Picture that with a Kodak
Picture that with a Kodak
Have you ever seen someone
That you thought was so sexy
And even though you had a man
He was still turnin' you on

Move the feelin' right
And I see you standin' there
Not an ordinary night
Feeling lust is in the air (hey)
Way your body looks
Its turnin' me on
They way you lick your lips slow
Makes me want you even more

[Chorus]
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
If so attracted
Could this be wrong
To feel this way
And come on so strong
Won't take my time
Cause u might be gone
Don't know your name
But your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
All alone tonight
And I left my man at home
I can't
Get you out my site
I know
This feeling is so wrong (hey)
I wanna approach you
Let you know how I feel
Wanna do more to
Try to seal this deal

[Chorus]
End of the night
Can I
Wait for you outside
We can
End this evening right
We can
Kick it on the side
I need to experience
What you can do
We'll have a private party
For just me and you

[Chorus]
First time I ever been so
Attracted to a stranger
Don't know if this is wrong but
Don't mind if in a danger
You caught my eye
Minute that I saw you
Knowin' that a may wanna get to know you
Can I get your name
Makin' me say (your turnin' me on)
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

[Chorus]
(Bet you're wonderin' what's been goin' on)
(Bet you think I've almost lost my mind)

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin with the lyrics and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw

At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
That I'm well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MC's are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we here we come like dum ditty dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches
The sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody let's show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower

Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate

Let's try to negotiate
Oh, let's try to negotiate

[Intro: Pitbull]
Me not workin' hard? Yeah right
Picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]

Reach for the stars, and if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, haha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons, baby baby
And it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby (Baby) I'll make you feel right, baby (Baby)
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (Dale)

That little chico Pitbull, Mr. 305
Used to live in every neighborhood in Miami
Putting it down with them tanners (hola)
Vedo-no Shake, what they do
Bang, welcome home
Demi, bet that up
Yessir
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Flaking the pot and watch it swim 90 miles, buddy
Vedo, Bang, Pitbull, it's all money
Grab the spatula
Pot racks and batch it up
Call him, bust that ass, niggas
Cause they still cashing up
It's more than Arm & Hammer
When them choppers cop
It's, it's bananas
Whipping up Carol City
Back it in Little Havana
Take it to Hotlanta
Then take it to Alabama
Where they do damage cause they
Breaking a nickel bag and they grabbing 'em
The Florida boys will squeeze the juice out of brick
To the point they'll even half-drop a hand, saying "oh shit"
One time for them tanners (hola)
Two times for the crib (305)
Three times for my dawg Demi with a ten-year bid
I left the streets alone
Bang, welcome home
Demi gave me the word
Now it's time to get in on
Vedo, Pitbull and Bang
Hey yo, switch over rain
Them boys gon' do they thing
Welcome to Dade County man
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)

[Vedo-no Shake]
Well if this money make it happen
Choppers clapping in your rearview
They talking cash with this mask, need a min or two?
Nine times outta ten
If he gon' rob, he gon' kill too
Pit gave the word, shot a bird
How it fell through
Now if you want it, want it, dawg
You can get it, get it
I do it for some change
Ain't no shame how she work with it
Twerk with it, lean with it, rock with it
Put it in a pack, make some g's on the block with it
Folds up, we got that fire brown
You can get yours right here
Start tripping if you wanna, boy
You can lose it right here
Yeah, right here, you can make it bubble up
X-man, ain't no question, I keep 'em doubled up
I'm from that south, south, with golds in my mouth, mouth
Representing my A, it ain't the same in a drought, drought
My homies don't fake, they call me No Shake
Prices going up, still got cake and it ain't my birthday

[Pitbull]
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow

We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)

[Bang]
I deal with ho's, pounds, quarters
Can I take your order
Boatloads, crash the boat, in Florida
It ain't for 10 g's, that's only in Tennessee
Miami Heat just won, a brick done went for 23
Bang, call me Saddam in this land, the hood terrorist
Get soldiers with the bomb in their hands
Got grams, like extra ???, not Narcs, you stupid?
You can smoke it, sell it, fucking snort it or shoot it
Well if I even much think Imma snort it and shoot it
And bring the whole kitchen sink, how the army'll do it
But the truth is, we ain't tryna get the strap off
We'd rather save our shells and sell crack raw
Hold up, code they finna take it over with baking soda
If you ain't down with Vedo or Pitbull, you ain't a soldier
The dunes call it Coca-Cola, dreds call it coco nuts
Colombians, coco leaves, kids eat your Cocoa Puffs

[Pitbull]
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Hahahahaa, you don't stop
You keep on and you don't stop
You can't front on that
To the S-K-B, you don't stop
Ha... whoo

Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you'd think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high?
You know that I'm gone and I'm a tell you all why!
So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wilding so listen
In my head I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down
Let it flow like a mud slide
And when I get on I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text y'all
I get props at my mention 'cause I vex y'all

So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
When you're so funny with the money that you flaunt
I said where'd you get your information from huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)

Well they call me Mike D the ever loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), well I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah!)
You scream and you holler, about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wetter than the ring around your collar
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping
Goin' from mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out you people like a casting call
Oh well it's wacked when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know with your flow when you're out gettin' by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm comin' off as you can bet
Well I think I'm losin' my mind, this time
This time I'm losin' my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losin' my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind (this time!)

So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
So what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving it's due time that I walk about
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize
Well I'm Dr. Spock I'm here to rock y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I said what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
Y'all suckers write me checks, and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner Victor the cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena
Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason but no cause
So if you're hot to trot you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be suckin' like a leech!

I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha what'cha what'cha want? (so what'cha want?)

I got the big brown boots
When you wanna get kicked like a rhyme
From the heart and the mind
There was a time when the blunt got licked
I take a hit of the weed and then blew a smoke screen
No Visine just a little, Afro-Sheen
And a High Times magazine
I like to smoke y'all, but the pigs come sweating
They like the smell of the weed that I'm smoking
They can't have none of the number one sess-stash
So keep your hands off the hash
Don't act rash, cause if you move too fast
I'll pull out my gat and blast your sorry ass...
And you can kiss my ass, haha
That was the "M" to the "I" to the "K" to the "E" to the "D" y'all

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know
We might not get tomorrow, let's do it tonight
Let's do it tonight
Let's do it tonight
Let's do it tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Excuse me (Excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (Tonight)
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight (Tonight)
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow (Woo)

Or we can pump it from the back to the front
Hey - hey baby

[Pitbull]
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la.. (aaah!)
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la.. (aaah!)
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la.. (aaah!)
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la.. (hey baby!)

[T-Pain]
Ooh drop it to the floor, make me wanna say it
Yeah you can shake some more, make me wanna say it
Ooh you got it, because you make me wanna say it
Yeah don't stop it - I want you tonight

[Pitbull]
Make money, make money - this chico right here gotta eat, baby
You scared money - don't make money, that's how it goes in the street, baby
But enough about the nonsense, baby girl take a shot clear your conscience
Not a goon or a goblin, I'm a monster
Cause I hit all the baddest women in the world - gangsta

Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la

[T-Pain]
Ooh drop it to the floor, make me wanna say it
Yeah you can shake some more, make you wanna say it
Ooh you got it, because you make me wanna say
Don't stop it - I want you tonight
1, 2, 1, 2, keep it on
Listen to the shit because we kick it until dawn
Listen to the abstract got it going on
Listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn
All your eggs then you you go up the river
Listen to the abstract that freaky nigga
Now, I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock
See I've got heart like John Starks, hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rocking the whole park
I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic on lust
And my moms is not butt
But fuck it, let me get down to the rhythm
Yes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism
Like John Holmes, the x-rated nigga
Listen to the shit 'cause I'm the ill figure
Nobody's getting any bigger than this
Get it together
Get it together
Get it
Phone is ringing, oh my God
Get it together
See what's happening
Ad rock down with the ione
Listen to the shit because both of them is boney
Got to do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie
Because she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight and why all the fuss
Because I ain't got no dust
Yea, you know I'm getting silly
Got a grandma Hazel and a grandma Tilly
I've got a Grand Royalprez and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender
Well, I'm long gone, word is born
Don't need a mother fucking fool telling me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I shall drive the lane like I was Evan Bernhard
And I've working on my game because life is taxing
Got to get it together and see what's happening
Get it together
Get it together
Get it together
See what's happening
I go one two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off 'cause yo, I'm not the herb
Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
Tho moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes I'd like to mention
When it comes to boning I'm representing
Spacing, zoning, talkin' on the phone and
My brain is roaming and I don't know where it's going
Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend
I've got to get him by the reigns because I know that I'm freaking
Well, I'm a funky skull and I'm a Scorpio
And when I get my flow I'm Dr on the go
So Q-Tip, what you on the mic for
Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme
And when M.C.S come in my face, I'm like mace
Because I back them off with the quills
Nigga 'cause I tell you, nigga 'cause I'll keep you under prills
Resting on nine one one sixteenth ave off the Farmes Boulevard
But I'm from Manhattan M.C.A.'s from Brooklyn
Yea, M.C.A., your shit be cooking
Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
So, yo tip, what's up with the boot on your feet
I've got the timbos on the toes and this is how it goes
Oh, one two, oh my God
One two, oh my God, I've got some shit
I've got the Kung Fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never, ever, ever smoking crack, never, ever, ever fucking wack
I eat the fuckin' pineapple now & laters
Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real
But, yo technically I'm as hard as steel
Gonna get it together, watch it
Gonna get it together Ma Bell
I'm like Ma Bell, I've got the ill communications
Ma Bell, I've got the ill communications
Ma Bell, I've got the ill communications
Ma Bell, I've got the ill communications
Ma Bell
Keep it on and on
Yeah... GET UP!
Yeah, uhh...
And then...
Yes here we go again, give you more, nothin lesser
Back on the mic is the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock, no pressure, yes, we need this
The best is yet to come and yes, believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
Sippin coffee playin Keno, in the casino
Want a lucky number? Ask Mike Dino
Yo I burn the competition like a flame thrower
My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older
I'm gettin bolder, competition is wanin
I got the feelin, assume the lane and
Make some noise if you're with me...
Make some noise if you're with me...
Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Takin emcees down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist, when I get pissed
You must have drank a fizzy-liftin drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just whiffin
When I catch you emcees it's time for wing-clippin
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego, is off, and runnin, and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you diss then that's wrong
Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitchin
Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf
Then you can show it to your friends and say "That's my old self"
Can't do me nuttin, can't tell me nada
Don't quote me now because I'm doin the lambada
The forbidden dance, here's my chance
To make romance in my b-boy stance
Parlayed romancin, into financin
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

[Refrain 1: Ne-Yo]
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Hey

Dale
Excuse me (Excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (Tonight)
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight (Tonight)
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know
We might not get tomorrow, let's do it toni-
Oh what you, what are you sayin'

All you Trekkie's and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingon's in the fuckin' house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pincher's
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with the needle nose pliers
Like Mutual of Omaha got the ill boat
You've never seen before glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene you know I get paid
Like Caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' 'Nick At Nite' with
Classics re-running that you know all right
Now remain calm no alarm 'cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good they put me in check
So believe when I say, I'm no better than you
Except when I rap so I guess it ain't true
Like that y'all and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out
What, wha-what, what, what's it all about
Work, wa-work, work, work, wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out
Said, Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission
Said, Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the rappin' Duke combined
Hey baby, bubba now what the deal
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi some hot potato
I stole your mic and you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up like a mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton but I don't wear sheer
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazin'
You're out of phase and my crews amazin'
We're working on the record yo
So stay patient
Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out
What, wha-what, what, what's it all about
Work, wa-work, work, work, wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out
(Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out)
(Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out)
(Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out)
(Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out)
Now, I go by the name of the King Adrock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy, who moi
I am the one with the clientele
You say, Adrock, you rock so well
I've got class like pink champ ale
MCA grab the mic before the mic goes stale
Don't test me they can't arrest me
I'll fake right crossover and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like cable guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me, you wanna rap
But what you're making ain't Hip Hop B
Now get your clothes right out the dryer
Put armor all up on your tire
Sport that fresh attire
Tonight we goin' out set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head
And say, Those were the days
Check, ch-check, check, check, ch-check it out
What, wha-what, what, what's it all about
Work, wa-work, work, work, wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out

Well now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile, I said
It always brings me back, when I hear 'OOH child!'
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I'll run the marathon to the very last mile

Well if you battle me, I will revile
People always say my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile
To step to me!? I'm a rapophile

If you want to battle, you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile

Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

Jazz and Awol that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream

Well I got to keep it going, keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour, too nice to be mean
Well on the tough guy style- I'm not too keen
To try to change the world- I will plot and scheme
Mario C likes to keep it clean
Gonna shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping 'cause that's my dream
A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes

When it comes to envy, y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine
Another dimension new galaxy

Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

We're from the family tree of old school hip hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live like an electric shock

I am known to do the Wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop
Beastie Boys known to let the beat...mmm 'DROP'!

Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm a lumber jack DJ Ad Rock
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock

Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uhh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA

Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter

Ahhh, That's how you feel man?

Now she want a photo Ya
You already know though

Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga wassup?

One, time fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Ya
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers

Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God Becky look at her butt

Wassap wassap

Wassap, wassap
{Long version of Thieves In The Temple}

I'm holdin' on (I'm holdin' on) the best that I can
Love please, (let me be) let me be the better man
Better than the ones that wanna count me out
Better than the ones that don't know what my love's about
I'm talkin' 'bout the kinda love that can move a mountain
The kinda love that could part the sea
The kinda love that'll last 4 ever
(no matter what u say we should be together)
U should be with me (thieves in the temple)
Yeah, u should be with me

I said I wanna know (talk to me)
One thing (talk to me)
Said I wanna know (talk to me)
I wanna know one thing, baby (talk to me)

How come you said that I was your baby
When u and your love was gonna leave
U led me on, led me on thinkin' U was Moses
Herding sheep blindly through a fantasy
U done me wrong (thieves in the temple)
And everybody knows it
Now the sound of my voice is pumpin' in your chest
More or less, I am here to tell u that
I am the best
Better than the rest
Better than the thieves in the temple tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, hurt me
(Put it in)
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple tonight

Put your foot on the rock

Put your foot on the rock

[Intro: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim
My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless
5 girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road
I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne
I would take you along, but then that college loan you’ll owe
Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us
Saying they all different, but I don’t show them no effort
Underestimated that 

[?], then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I’m blessed it, cross-sign baptism West shit
Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head-on
I'm too strong, eight arms sticking to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks, so I hope it open every door

[Hook: Tyga (x2)]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 2: Wale]
Never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest
And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I’ma do it to death
We in cool with all of these niggas
I’m through with all of these niggas
You fool with all of these niggas
You lose like all of these (niggas)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits
Anybody riding with young’in will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Finna be king, but I’m way too proud to offer as minion
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don’t offer the least of shit to these people’s opinions
I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the b*tches
Double M-G, Y-M-C-M, B because we run this you dig?
We all kings, give anything to my soft queens
I’m lost without them, when they around I am Charles Sheen

[Hook: Tyga (x2)]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 3: Nas]
You’re in the presence of a majestic, esoteric
Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected
I can say ghettoest ‘cause I come from where metal spit
Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil’s grip
Won’t pop another pill, can’t drink another sip
Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can’t, I love this shit
I seem to love these whips - a white
Maserati’s my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Draws
That’s the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I’m born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gangbang
‘Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
So that make you a queen, surviving anything
Escobar season begins, so let the semis ring
Pimp of the year, I could smack your father
Not only with my hand, but with a black revolver
I been in pressed silk since breast milk
Mets cap on tilt, we some kings, nigga

[Chorus]
You wanna see some ass?
I wanna see some cash
Keep them dollars coming
(Gangsta Grillz)And that's gon make me dance
And that's gon make me dance
(Its Gangsta Grillz you bastard)And that's gon dance

[Tyga]

Weatherman hot thunderstorm
Thunderstorm light yellowbone
C-c-can you swim in a.. (Gangsta gangsta)
Make it rain make it rain
Weatherman hot thunderstorm
Thunderstorm light yellowbone
C-c-can you swim in a flood

Get metal spoon
Even green wrapped in baloon

High school big booty Judy
You can sit juice on it
Act a fool this fool rollin'
Cream pot get a scoop of it
Ugh im nasty

Batter batter batter batter
Swing your legs in the air

Undo my shades can't help but stare

She said..

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse One: T.I.]
Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's, mo' because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(niggas feelings) And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]
I'm the prince shorty don't get it twisted
Been callin shots simpin 'fore my flows existed
And still find birds in my momma kitchen
You might see me burnin purple in the subdivision
I got soldiers on deck, babyface pimpin
Whatchu' know 'bout dat, I get a bad Brenda
With that vert' top back, my jeans feelin tight
Cause my pockets stay fat, playa better know that
My neck got so much shit, danglin
Big dick, big chain, we just keep on hangin
Got a Hollywood ho, and a broad that be sangin
They be hatin cause I'm famous 

[?] what I was thankin
And this for every don nigga thankin he passed me
Y'all just thank that you gone and the shit'll be nasty
I'ma stay ballin, ballin off my old school classic
Lil Scrap got big bank, now see if you can match it

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams

I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

[Verse Three: Big Kuntry King]
Shorty I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number one hustler, I keep the street blazin
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry pickin hustlers out here slavin
That king shit nigga runs deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne
That's pimpin! My gas is premium like octane
Cain't tell me nuttin 'bout stackin these Benja-maynes

[Verse Four: T.I.]
I'm the king of the Dirty, see me seated in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a prince that's so demandin and an aura so strong
The South ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'ma blick 'em 'til I get you plain and simple
Brass knuckles to your dentals blast suckers in they dimples

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines

I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off

Platinum plaques from way back, look what I provided
Virginia on the map now we causing a riot

Be machine incause it, put it in your closet
And don't try to compete with me
People be nigga forfeit
You need to make wise choice, cause I'm like fresh big porget
My engine is like, like-like-like 700 hundred horses
Orianous light your torches
Act a fool get towards it
Cause I'm bout to break-break-break
Break ya back, homie

Feat. Jermaine Dupri, Kanye West, Shyne, Twista

[Intro - J.D.]
Uh, listen up listen up listen up world
Listen up listen up listen up world, uh, I gotta confess
This the hottest remix I ever did in my life so so def

[Verse One - Shyne] (J.D.) {*Shyne on the phone*}
Sittin in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
Would I be here today if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walkin on this earth is
At night, I would've gotten murdered
If I ain't grab the hatchet and let them cowards have it
(Ohh, that's the boy Shyne y'all
It's ya boy on his way home man, the boy on his way home man)

[Chorus - Usher] (Kanye West) These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions
Chorus - Usher] (J.D.)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way (yeah)
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confession

[J.D. - Talking]
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista

[Verse Two - Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

[Verse Three - Kanye West]
Yeah Kanye To tha College Dropout
Man, how does she bring it up how does she break it down
Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere cause everytime you go there
There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "man don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat, don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on paychecks
Things come up from way way way back I confess

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Trap pussy, fuck her in a black hoodie
Fucking in the house, while Momma cookin
Them tacos, bitch I need two mo'
Knock the pussy out the park; Pujols
Ass Sumo, all gold two door
Bitches wanna hammer baby, but this ain't Juno
You know, I got the ratchet on me cause I'm too on
Know where I'm from streets getting hotter than Tucson (Augh!)
Rachet City, welcome to the real 50's
Creased Dickies, nigga don't be conversing with me
Brought the silks out niggas say I'm looking Biggie
Pussy ain't shit, but the hoes will make me richer
Shh, ha, money in the mattress
Now it's money in the mansion, I'm throwing money she dancing
I'm a motherfuckin G, hella path for a bachelor
Ratchet, hating niggas hacking
Tell me where the...

[Hook]
Where the ballers at, ask me where the ballers at
Hut one, hut two, im the quarter back
Fuck a pretty bitch gotta let you have it
I don't do this for the motherfucking rapping
I do this for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Verse two, sadity man I hate those
Go bowling in her pussy, A-hole
Nice face but her ass like play dough
Charge on the mouth with my dick; Diego
Knock it off knock it in then knock it down
Mayweather with the ratchets, knock 'em out
Said her last nigga weird, Pacquiao
Left her in the studio, ass up face down
Pretty bitches gon' hate, we dont need that
Where the ratchets at? Tell me where the ratchets at
Shake your ass to the beat then bring it back
Mills said bleed, driver can you handle that?

[Hook]

[Verse 1: OneRepublic]
For those days we felt like a mistake
Those times when love's what you hate
Somehow, we keep marchin' on
For those nights when I couldn't be there
I've made it harder to know that you know
That somehow, we'll keep moving on

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
There's so many wars we've fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have, I promise you that
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on
There's so many wars we've fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have, I promise you that
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
So many hills we had to climb
Almost without our strength
But we kept... slowly marching on
Time heals the wounds we couldn't close
Blood sweat and tears dried up
We're okay, we kept marching on

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
There's so many wars we've fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have, I promise you that
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on
There's so many wars we've fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have, I promise you that
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Get your legs and walk because we're not too far
A little more to go, but well we marching on
Ah, well, we marching on, ah, well, we marching on
Ah, well, we marching on, ah, well, we marching on
If we lose the sun, we turn the night back
Yep, we going to win, we got to fight back
We marching on, ah well we marching on
Ah well we marching on, ah well we marching

[Bridge: OneRepublic]
The bridges are gone, and we're almost home
The end is clo-ose

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
There's so many wars we've fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have, I promise you that
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on
There's so many wars we've fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have, I promise you that
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on
My name is Tom Cranker and I'm a jolly banker

If you show me you need it, I'll let you have credit

Singing I'm jolly banker jolly banker am I
When the landlords abuse you, or sadly misuse you
I'm a jolly banker, jolly banker am I
I'll send down the police chief to keep you from mischief
Singing I'm jolly banker, jolly banker am I

[Intro - T.I.]
Is that T.I. over there? is that him?
Is that you? Rubber Band Man
Boyyyyyy..... is that T.I.? Whoooo..
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Remix Playa, yeah, y'all already know what it is man
T.I.P, came from the south, Rubber Band man boyyyyy...
Connected with my folk from the West Mack
My folk from the Chi' Twista
And T Double D, from the bottom

[Hook - T.I.]
Rubber Band man, wild as the Taliban
Nine in my right, forty-five in my other hand
I'm in trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss...?

[Verse One - T.I.]
I'm young pimpin', way out of ya vision
Don't set your sights on my position, I'm way out ya division
I was grindin' while you was tryin' to figure out your division
I'm sittin' on the block and watchin' hustlas makin' and killin'
Until I, jumped in the game without my uncle's permission
Makin', solvin' my family's wishes through whatever conditions
I'm workin' trappin' servin' kitchens with intentions to get in
My mittens under cover millions workin' off of comission
Everyday I'm on a mission with heavy haters so listen
Divide it, flip it, weigh and ship it, 'til you cook it and sniff it
When I talk, G's listen they can see
I been livin' the same, life that I'm spittin'
I ain't frontin' and trippin'
I came, out of the trap I ain't come here to visit
I named the album Trap Muzik 'cause I'm being specific
To my niggas still investin' in caine
I'm wearin' rubber bands just out of respect for the game

[Verse Two - Mack 10]
I got that wizerk, dawg i got them birdies that don't chizerp
Water ex pills sticky green and the purple sizerp
And no matter where I'm at, is west coast or up front
I'm low key I can't stunt and move a hundred bricks a month
In the east they like my swagger, them broads be up on me
In the south they love me, cause I'm down and dirty homie
And if you get it how you live as a gangsta then stand up
Mack10 a 'D boy', so my cash is rubberbanned up

[Hook - T.I.]
Rubber Band man, wild as the Taliban
Nine in my right, forty-five in my other hand
I'm in trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss...?
Rubber Band man, wild as the Taliban
Nine in my right, forty-five in my other hand
I'm in trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss...?

[Verse Three - Trick Daddy]
I represent for the Tre-o-five
Down with the rubberband man, y'all call him young T.I
See I been an O.G., far from O.D.'n and this is
T double D don't even call me Maurice, now listen
My description is tall, dark, skinny, and ill-mannered
A hood negro with a little bit of spanish be like
Say yo papi, I got, yayo papi if
Your price is right come on down and y'all copy
Watch me, I'm gettin' money like it's 1984
Got so much cash Bill Gates could kiss my ass (yeah)
I'm such a player they call me Juan Pierre
Been ballin' since my younger years like ya boy Cabrera

[Verse Four - Twista]
I'm a windy city man
The one that take sip and run it to the brain
Love to get it crunk in the south where
My cousins from, and shawty shake that thang
Take the hipno' to the dome, smokin
When im rollin, wood on chrome
Thump if it ain't Kamikaze or
Trap Muzik then i dont put it on
When im on the court call my pacman
Yell out that i got that dro', watchin for that po'
You can get that Jag for a hundred but
Im givin out the ounces for fo', let a nigga kno'
Call me the rain man from the place
Where they gang bang
Where them thangs bang, and the brains hang
Where we gotta main-tain
Can I cutt and hit it girl, come on let me get it get it girl
I love the girls from New Orleans, to ATL
To St. Louis, and the "the Windy City"girls
Blow fire man, when that hoe slide down
The pole like a fireman

[Hook - Twista]
I'm the Slow Jam man, rollin' wit' the rubber band man
Desert Eagle in my right, with a Three Fifty-seven off in my other hand
(Who I'm isss..) I'm in trouble man, always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevy's all colors man, who I'm isss..?

[Hook Until Fade - T.I.]

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
They ain't runnin' the damn thing with they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
It's a given and it ain't 'cause what I'm doin' for a livin'
It's more because of what I'm doin' how I'm livin'
Not to mention when I'm rappin', I'm just hurtin' niggas feelings
And still chillin' on somethin' that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
But while the crack was in the house
The record sale went through the ceiling
So say what you want and do what you please
But for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So niggas will come and look for you if you sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say and be easy
Else it'll be a long day

[Hook: T.I.]
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the South
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out 'cha mouth

[Verse 2: The Game]
Everybody wanna be the King of the West
But, they ain't runnin' the damn thing in the West
That's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin' they minds
Stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
My crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
And it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
So nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin' drug dealin', some people say I'm a villain
Went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin' millions
So watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
'Cause to me, murderin' wack mc's is somethin' like a disease
Top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
And where I'm from, niggas throwin' up B's and C's
So make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say
And be easy, else it'll be a long day

[Hook: The Game]
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, impala with the top knocked off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the West
I'm a king, disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech

[Bridge: The Game & T.I.]
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
Or get your ass laid back
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
Or get your ass laid back
Fuckin' with Black Wall Street and Pimp Squad Click Get
Laid out like a drunk, on the late, late
So haters hate, the hell with all the hearsay
From Wednesday to Tuesday, T.I.P. act a fool, hey

[Hook: The Game & T.I.]
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the West
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out 'cha mouth
I'm a king

[Timbaland]
You see? I think it's time for me put it down..
.. for my females, hahah
I'ma let my females shine on this track
You see? I ain't biased
I ain't racist either
So I'ma let uhh.. Mocha bring it in

[Mocha]
The one boss bitch, not on that horse shit
Honey I wanna score with, money, I'm all for it
Speak the raw shit, they on the floor quick
Prepare to be surprised, if you think I'm a poor chick
Got off the wall shit, who could be more thick?
Plus I can flip, rough-up, or flatten out, four bricks
As for the mic, I can break flow out, or either bless em
My style is my own, and a shorty, can't test it
So y'all - ramble on, I'ma get my gamble on
Ceram' handle-arm, while y'all scramble on
Want to battle? It's on, I'll take you on anywhere
I'll take you on a bus, on a boat, or up in the air
I'll take you on with the gat, I'll take you on on the track
I'll take yo' ass on a trip, and you never come back
Though this a freestyle, these styles ain't free
When I'm done, better believe, they got a PILE for me
Chorus: Timbaland and Babe Blue (repeat 2X)
What cha know about this, ha? You don't know
Lemme show you bout this, ha? We gon' blow
We don't go without hits, ha? Get the dough
You can never doubt this, ha? Ha?

[Mocha]
Y'all go 'head and yap on, I'ma keep rap strong
Talk but don't act on what you rap on (say what?)
I speak facts to beat clacks, and lead tracks
Heed that, relax, feedback? Keep that
Bet-ta ease back, never see me slack
Break your kneecaps - then, have you do three laps
Tryin to see this half a mil, y'all - dingy stacks
For - weed in sacks, tote - ki's to crack
Wonder why they can't keep they eyes off me?
Y'all chicks ain't 8, I'm a dime plus 3
Got a 6? I got a stack
Got a whip? I got a jet
Got a clip? I got a tec
That's why you not a threat
Wanna know how you could be down too?
Can not do, make em say "ahhh, oohh"
Been through it, put too much into it
And writin so long, I ran out of pen fluid
Chorus {except last line}

[Timbaland] Babe Blue

[Babe Blue]
Y'all chicks assed out, Babe Blue's here
Shook out your mind, cause my debut's near
All y'all demo chicks see me when you master yours
I surpass you whores, then I smash your broads
Shorty, don't get your hopes high, praise the most high
Babe Blue, livin loca
I crush all those, small hoes, what?
My go-to-the-store clothes is better than your wardrobe
You ain't seein mine, I walk right in the club
You one of them chicks that be in line
Me? Studded out, ice flooded out
Bitch you ain't nice - please, cut it out
Bronx to the death, we gon' spit raw
Timbaland got beats, what you talkin shit for?
Forget yours, Moch' and Blue, comin through
Bystorm, Z Man, tell me what you gon' do?
Chorus

[Timbaland] It ain't over!

[Babe Blue]
Y'all chicks talk a lot, now you wanna hate me?
Moch' and Blue, Cagney and Lacey
Start the biddin wars at 1.2
We gonna show all of y'all what one joint do
You wanna get the third degree, cause you never heard of me?
See thugs murder me, deep blood burgundy?
Hell nah, see I'm tryin to get my mail ma
But y'all chicks didn't know, so I had to tell y'all
Chorus

Careful not to break your concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance
Balance, if you fall, baby
Girl that won't be cute at all
Drink in the your left hand
Girlfriend in your right
Only comes dancing, holding on forget all night
Long legs and a short skirt
Equals one hell of a night
And now Im talking about
Such a beautiful crowd
Levels on the ten
Were standing on chairs

Girls getting real wild
Hair blowin' in the wind

Jumping up and down baby I'm teen

Listen to the sounds so hypnotizing
And I bet before the night end

Take her home, get it on the next morning
Baby girl, give me that one more
Give me before you go
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)

Betta come off a butta ton, brotha run, I hope he said he were
Ima flow until my belly hurt
Pimp nigga rockin on tha stage an rock on in the petty shirt
Let it ruff, ooh
Feels like anotha one
Who you be? Mr. Shystie
The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea
The muthafucka most likely
To get a tuba with the opposition in my position
I break em off when I give em tha heat
Steady re' for rollin
Bullets body decomposion
I dismember the weak on the Timbaland beat
You remember the beat
Conversation we had
When my adrinallin was rushin
Check yo brakes and knee pads
When the twis to get tha bus in
Bodys gon' get rushed in
I can make em hit tha dance flo
Brothas, bitches, and hustlers
I get up in the guts homie, never phoney
Hitta wigga when he run up on me
Yall muthafuckas still don't know me
Let em' learn slowly

[Chorus:2x]
Who you be?

Center maka up tha party, rockin bodys
With tha thugga hands up in the sky
Neva shy he's fly
Who am i, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck
T-straight from the Chi
Ribal, homosydal, everybody duck
With tha party up and pimp struck
T-N-T now I say who am I
Who you be? Who am I?
The one who's surrounded by the wood
500 wid the ribs stickin through the hood
Up to no good thats why'd stay they misunderstood
And Im always in tha mix of some shits
Scoop a shawty an she thick
And tha bitch getts grip in them hips
Putta dick on tha lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal
So I tricked on that bitch
Now who you be?
The one who's on tha dance floor
Sex gon be one of tha mass hoes
Freak on a bad hoe
You's could really wanna flash gold
Turn a hater to a sass hoe
Play an ballin up at Cape Town, strippin went down
Study, tippin off of CDs an Tapes
Though see niggas see Gs to take
Run up to tha car, got no thangs
They got CDs to break, no easy pace
Who you be?

Photo stank and yall be who to see
Only smokin it wid you and me
Lets go hang out where tha booty be
I was on sumthin, no frontin
Yello wide ol' belly in the po funkin
Grinnin while up in the curb
Wanna journey for herb
Always tellin somebody to smoke somethin
True indeed

[Chorus 2x]
The one thats flowin fluently
Make yo baby say goo to me
Whatcha did to her
Didn't ask why I hit her for
Cause the game like liturature

But if you ain't wid a partna

Shake a lil bit of dat body

To my playas an soldiers, shady niggas, young thugs and strap hoes
Pimps strikin fees and red bones
Ghetto fees and Gs an MC's for the rifols

Pimp slach tingin twista from tha Chi

[Chorus 2x]

[Timbaland]
Ha ha ha ha
Yall didn't think that I would do it again twice did ya
Ha ha
I do it like that, I put it down
For tha 98 or TNT
Thang ya know what Im sayin
Timbaland and Twista
Yall fools couldn't recognize could ya?
I put it down for all parts of the area
We out
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all of the fellas in the world she belongs to me
But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me
Soon we'll be married and raise a family
A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you, I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems
But it was just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
I tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
Every night, on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die"
Ooh, her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me
Just my imagination, once again
Running away with me
Oh, I tell you it was just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her but I can't forget her
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
She's never hard to find
Just my imagination
She's always on my mind
(Running away with me)
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
Just my imagination
Running away with me
I never met her but I can't forget her
Just my imagination
Lets go down, together
3 A.M tomorrow night
Ill take you over anything
Lets go out, together
Broad daylight in the street
Ill take you anywhere
Your music fills my car
Your voice breaks every time

I love you girl, with all my heart and soul
I can't understand why you treat me cold
Your every wish, girl, is my command
And that's why I can't seem to understand why
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue

One day you say you love me too
The next day you tell me that we are through
My love for you is just a game
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Oh)
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (So blue)

Woo girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Make me blue)
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl tell me why can't you be true (Can't be true)
The way you treat me it just isn't fair
You make it so plain you just don't care
You have a ball around my time
Sleepless nights are getting me tired
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Baby)
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue

[Intro]

[Chorus]
He ain't really from that block (Bitch who?)
He ain't really getting that guap (Bitch who?)
He ain't on top (Bitch who?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded?
He ain't really got it like that (Bitch who?)
I bet he gon' be quiet after that (Bitch who?)
That nigga's shit wack (Bitch you?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded?

[Verse 1]
Gangsters all sport just look
Shook, who me? I've never been nothing of the sort
Want the title? Buck for it, it's yours
Getting ignored 'cause you so piss-poor
Forced me to pull, kick doors, need mine on time
You could be sure shawty's gonna shine, trust
Left niggas in the dust, Trap Muzik
Try to let you catch up, but you niggas just suck, bad
Fall short, not enough swag
So I had to give you niggas so much gas
Get a maid costume and a broom 'cause you finna get
Swept off your feet tryna step up to me
I'll put your ass Down Under if it's left up to me
Like boomerangs and kangaroos, now tell me I ain't a fool
Stack money like jewels
Let a nigga take something from me, I refuse, who?
I'm so cool, rock my jewels wherever
Rob me? Dude, I dare ya
Have ya hats in a box and ya soul in the air
Say your prayers and say hello to Laya

[Chorus]
He ain't really from that block (Bitch who?)
He ain't really getting that guap (Bitch who?)
He ain't on top (Bitch who?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded?
He ain't really got it like that (Bitch who?)
I bet he's gon' keep it quiet after that (Bitch who?)
That nigga's shit wack (Bitch you?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded? (Nigga!)

[Verse 2]
I hate you be comparing my shit to theirs, dare and try
Don't even think it's fair that guy could breathe the same air as I
I'm out there, way left field like Jamiroquai
Pharaoh fly, running chicks in and out the Merriott
They come get served then leave like a carry-out
Restaurant, resembling some young Gloria Estefans
Listen, one, don't violate or I annihilate
Opposition out of play, hatin' I don't tolerate
Came out the gates dead serious
Ain't a lot changed since then, atop the top ten
God favors me like I'm without sin, go figure
Get bigger every year, still the same old nigga
Money don't change no nigga
You started out a lame and get fame, but you the same hoe nigga
Ain't no flow sicker, everything I made dumb, crazy
Deranged insane I say

[Chorus]
He ain't really from that block (Bitch who?)
He ain't really getting that guap (Bitch who?)
He ain't on top (Bitch who?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded?
He ain't really got it like that (Bitch who?)
I bet he's gon' keep it quiet after that (Bitch who?)
That nigga's shit wack (Bitch you?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded? (Nigga!)

[Verse 3]
I woke up this morning, I jumped up
I heard some wack music, what the fuck?
I guess these niggas Gumped up
I wish some fuck niggas knuckle up
'Cause we done slaughtered niggas every year
Bought the cleanest, all our tears
Park the Chargers over there, park Ferraris over here
Niggas never been a pimp, all they's really been a square
And I dare a nigga try to run the cap, aim for the chair-
Man, what? We got them rifles and we Tali-
Ban, and we break it in like the Mexi-
Cans, stacks on me, boy, I got them heavy
Pants, strap on me, nigga I make you do that
Dance, you playing with the Godfather Trilogy
Y'all boys ain't never seen my squad in a century
Wrong move, so I hit you with a penalty
This non-profit, nigga, westside ministry

[Chorus]
He ain't really from that block (Bitch who?)
He ain't really getting that guap (Bitch who?)
He ain't on top (Bitch who?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded?
He ain't really got it like that (Bitch who?)
I bet he's gon' keep it quiet after that (Bitch who?)
That nigga's shit wack (Bitch you?) I beg your pardon
You bumped your fucking head? Is you retarded? (Nigga!)

Chorus
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
You got the vocab
You know I got the vocab
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
Hey, yo pass the mic so I can tell 'em I got the gift o' gab
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself. (x3)
Hey yo catch me when I'm sober, but now I drink for the belt
So pass the root straight to the right hand side
Make no mistake that the buzz is a natural high
I said it's big emergency mind your busy body
He hit me. I broke his nose. The referee's Mr Fuji
So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here
So now when I back track
I back track far enough to make a nigga run and leave his tongue back
You think I'm cool I think you're cruel so here's a shell cap
On your gluteus maximus and leave ya handicapped
Ratatatat
Chorus

Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?) (x3)
Boat people here we go Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho Yeah
Some quest for the truth, some bust a loop
And search for some knowledge that come runnin' in the woods
And if I should a choose to be one
Then I will be a ???? hoodin' with books and look to kill
My proof is in my puddin'
If I chill in the hood would you be say that I'm hoodin'?
Now. Let me exercise a new style that will brutalise
MCs into a warpath genocide
Nobody move, nobody get hurt. It's a homocide
So jump jump punks ready to get stuck
Evil Kenevil was my man, someone for the stunts
I'm mostly fillies, I'm just straight up front, ha
Meat ya tryin' to light up you get blast like nitrogen
Runnin' for mercy, runnin' for oxygen
Bad L.A. meat you're better off comittin' suicide
I shoot the lip so high I strip you of your carbon dioxide
Rock-a-bye the lullaby he be singin' 'Oh my'
Boof Baff another son a go die
What's the matter with the black man? (Black man) (x2)
Now a statistic. So dreams of her become realistic

Poor bastard gets mystic I don't believe you checked the psychic
Emancipate your mind. Don't set the limit. Reach the summit
Free your spirit 'cause your blunted
From the lyrics I just stuttered
'Live off the streets' says the brother with the machete
'Live off the lady' says the brother with the Glock in patrol
I live logically, no weak slave to poverty
You see it's very easy to slip between the asphalt sheet
Brothers from my way they used to get mad plays
Till they caught us bustin' doughnuts 'til the break of day
Brother, my brother, you played me undercover
She wouldn't be your lover so now you tried to dis her
For sister. You missed her but ask yourself a question
Can I make a suggestion? I need a true confession
Is she skivs 'cause the skin that she's in makes you sin?
Does you hit her just to get her integrate another sister?
Mister. I asked him for a hanky. He asked if he could spank me
So why'd you disrespect me, sir?
Were you thinking I'm misguided or were you tryin to hide it
That you had no father figure
Which? Check out your wackness. It won't distrust my blackness
I wonder for a smack, but don't think that it would help this
What's the matter with the black man (Black man)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha) (x2)
Come jackin' it up an' I bad an' me fell in ma booby trap
With a rappin' up for the eight track play back laid back sit back
An I'll ???? an me runnin' ???? as a matter a fact
'Cause I trappin' a back like a cool six pack now bring it back. Woah!
United we stand, divided we crumble
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall (x2)
These days every man want to be a god
Lay down the gun every man on the floor
But the real gunman him not play Hollywood role
Because he pull out his gun and send another boy down
Watch us bleed. Another gunman go bleed
Watch us bleed. If I used up all my dust I got ????
Watch us bleed. Me up an' comin' ready
Watch us bleed. Watch us for original Tranzlator Crew

Then when i wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex
If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make u understand
That everything I wanna do 2 your body, baby

Love has problems I know but they're problems
We'll just have to face, oh yeah, yeah

We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back
And don't look back, oh yeah, yeah

There's something that can be done
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done
So if you just put your hand in mine

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner, well
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah... ooh Lord

[Hook]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished

[Verse 2]
Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life
Little life, little lie, oh yea
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby

[Hook]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah

[Intro: Prince and Eve]
Hot wit you
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl

[Verse 1: Prince]
I want to get hot with you
I wanna get you underneath the cream
And do the marshmallow
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get you to do something you thought you'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights on a hot summer night, nude
I wanna get hot with you

[Chorus: Prince and Eve]
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me

Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl

I wanna make you climb this chain around my waist
So I can prove that I'm the only one that brings out
The freak in you
I wanna get hot with you

[Refrain: Prince]
I wanna get hot wit you
I wanna get hot wit you
I wanna get hot wit you

[Verse 3: Eve]
Know the body banging, got you singing
Ignore the shouts from the neighbors, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine, now you know you can't stop her
Trying to turn me out, never happen, so start this
I'm supposed to tremble 'cause they call you 'The Artist'?
Let's wild out, can you handle ruff riding?
Treat you like a freak of the week and had you hiding from me
I do whatever you like, if you could take it
If I could be your girlfriend, you could catch me naked
Can't front sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think I'm ready for you to make me an example
I mean , come on, why front on
I'd never place time, queen in your life
I'm there whenever
The things that you feeling for me, mutual
That I'm ready to call you daddy
Even get hot wit you

[Chorus: Prince and Eve]
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl

[Verse 4: Prince]
Take a drive to the ocean
And drown you in a wave
(Hot with you)
Of a hundred thousand compliments, boo
I want you every day
(Hot with you)
And to be cool
And the only way to do that is every night
(Hot with you)
Get hot, get hot (Hot) with you (Hot)
Yeah baby

[Chorus: Prince and Eve]
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl
Tonight you're livin' in a fantasy
Your own little nasty world
Treat you like the freak of the week
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
I bet you're a nasty girl

[Outro: Prince]
Nasty girl, nasty
Nasty girl, nasty
Nasty girl, nasty
I wanna get hot wit you
You surely must know magic girl
'Cause you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
But you made it sunny and bright
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see, girl
Just knowin' your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin' in on me, girl
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
Baby, you're part of every thought I think each day
Your name is used in every phrase my lips sing
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey, I can't live without you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You're my everything
You're my everything
(You're my everything, girl)
You're the girl I sing about in every love song I sing
(You're my everything)
You're my winter, baby, my summer, my fall and spring
(You're my everything)
Now, now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
You're my everything
(When my way was dark)
You're my everything
(And troubles were near)
Don't you know, baby
You're my everything
You're my everything
(You're my everything)
You're my everything
(My everything)
Girl, you're my everything
You're my everything
(You're my everything)
You're my everything
(You're my everything)
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Aye two things I know for sure
Pimpin' hard and love hurt
Trying to make love work
When you're dodging love's curse
Whoever may object
Tell them fall in love first
Used to think it was simple
Just throwin' dubs on a bird
But it's hard, giving someone your heart
Lowering your guard
And now you towing a scar
Cause someone tore it apart
You ask God and the stars why it is like this
You recall the start, it didn't begin like this
It was a bright day
Blowing the hay
Drawing the L
65 Impala
The breeze blowin' your hair
In some nice shades, riding the the subs, grabbing your rear
In my lap on the way from the club in no underwear
I remember rushin' home just knowing you was there
And now I feel alone, ain't even knowing if you care
Don't spare my feelings
You don't share my feelings
Is it as strong as it was in the beginning?
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Remember time and time again, just tryin' to make it work
We'd kiss, fuck, and break up again
Man, we're making it worse
Relationship was solid, shit was sacred at first
I did my dirt, and you thinking I'm just a fake and a flirt
I thought you said that hurtful shit you said cause you was mad at me
But slowly I realized you said it cause you ain't happy
Am I meant to grow old alone, just like my daddy?
A bullseye for bitchest throwin' they pussy at me?
I respect us too much to stand to see you sad
I'd rather let you go and find the man you never had
Arguments and "I'm sorry" that we ain't bothered to say
Just made it harder to remember why we bothered to stay
How can the good outweigh when we fight everyday
Remember I used to be the nigga who would brighten your day?
And you used to say "I miss you, wish I could've saw you today"
Now if I call you, you know all I gotta say is
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
You can catch me in the Maybach
Laid back, puffin' on the finest tree
Or chillin' with two or three chicks
That could crush a nigga's top ten picks
With ease, darlin'
Even though my pimp hand is strong
My patience is long
And I'd give it all up just to see you in them thongs
One more time, baby
One more time, darlin'
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Do you really want me, baby?
Cause I want you
Now let me tell you somethin'
I know I ain't your first
And you won't be my last
Understand, but still, if we gonna make this thing work
We gotta put the past in the past
And leave it there
You leave it
Do you really want me?
How did I get in this predicament?
How did I get in this jam?
The person that they accuse me of being of
That's not the one I really am
I am the one that really loves you
With all my mind body and soul
With every stroke of my brush
I wanna paint a wall around you
So that you will never know

All the pain that a human has to go thru
In a planet that's so bitter and cold
Universal love awaits you baby
All you got to say is that you really really really wanna go
And we're outta here

The space
Do you wanna?
Do you want to go?
Where the Sun's go
Where the tears flow
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?
How did I let you hypnotize me?
Did it have anything to do with your lips?
Did it have anything to do with your cool disposition?
Did it have anything to do with your kiss?
Where in the world did you learn to put your arms around me and cause my temperature to rise?
Sometimes I get the feeling this was all meant to be
Just like the sun and moon, you and I

All the pain that a human has to go thru
In a planet that's so bitter and cold (so cold)
Universal love awaits you
Baby all you gotta say is that you really really really wanna go
And we're outta here

The space
Do you wanna
Do you want to go
Where the Sun's go
Where the tears flow
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?

(Crooked letter, crooked letter, crooked letter I...)

This is the space where my love goes
Look up lay back and let the wild flow
This is the space where my hands go
If they're too hot the water should be cold
This is the space where the cream flows
Over my shoulder till my friend grows
On and on 'til we both know
Universal love in the '94
Do you wanna?

[Timbaland]
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh, uh, uh uh

Ginuwine

[Ginuwine - Verse One]
You can't fool me girl
I know you well
What's on your mind
It ain't hard to tell
Don't leave me now
Don't play wit' me
You think I'm blind
But baby I can see
I saw your eyes, from across the room
You was checkin' me out, and I was scopin' you too
Don't say I'm wrong (what)
Don't mind those eyes
I'ma call your bluff
So baby tell me why

[Ginuwine (Timbaland) - Chorus]
Tell me standing here (tell me baby am I gettin' on your nerves)
Baby keep it real (why don't you tell me how you feel)
Tell me what's on your mind (tell me am I wasting my time)
I gotta know, baby let me know

[repeat x2]

[Ginuwine - Verse Two]
Could you have told me girl
Is what I said
You can tell the truth
I'm all in your hand
And what's wrong wit' that
Are you ashamed of me?
You can fool your girls
But you can't fool G
I saw your eyes, from across the room
You was checkin' me out, I was scopin' you too
Oh I'll turn and walk away
If you deny (I)
But before I go
Could you tell me why

[Repeat Chorus x2]

[Timbaland]
Baby baby
Baby baby
What's yo name
What's yo name
How bout you
How bout you
Come play our game
Come play our game
It's me and Ginuwine
It's me and Ginuwine
A new day and time
A new day and time
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
Wha wah wha
Wha wah wha

[Repeat Chorus x 3]
I don't care where you came from
Oh no, I don't care what you've been
All I know is that, I love you
And I'm gonna love you till the end
(Gonna love you until the end)
'Cause you're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
For every hand there's a glove
For every, for every heart there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind
(Nobody's gonna change my mind)
'Cause you're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
Yes, you're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
You're my
(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
(Better than anyone)
(Better than anyone)
I love you
(Better than anyone)
Than anyone before
(Better than anyone before)
A-do me right because I love you
(Better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you
(Better than anyone)

[spoken]
Whats happening man this T.I.P. you kno I like to dedicate this song to anybody who every lost
Somebody, to the grave, to the streets, to the jail sail, I done been in situations where I done had to
Cope with all three you kno what Im saying, I feel like the only thing haven't done die you kno..Just
Remember where you live while you here ain't half as important as where you gone live when you leave you
Kno what Im saying

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs they come and go ....but when I die I hope I live in the sky...All my folks who
Ain't alive I hope they live in the sky..pray to God when I die that I live in the sky ..It's true what
Goes around comes back you kno..So when I die I hope I love in the sky..All my folk who ain't survive may
They live in the sky...Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky...

[Verse 1]
My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done that my muthafuckin folk and I love that nigga til death no muthafuckin joke
I can feel my eyes feelin the lord is my witness
If I catch em Imma kill em I made it my bizness
Back in the day you stayed in my bizness taught I didn't have to corporate yay in my bizness
Coincedently that's why today you not wit me
My cousin died ova some yay and I miss em
Plus he had his family out let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave her life sentence
I heard that now Im dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments and still and brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Who ever seen a nigga go to jail sleep til day two
Well thats how sick I was when Jay blew
Found out
The hard way that whating pour they was tooting
Over-dosed on heroin died at 22
If you ain't heard about
Daughter she smile just like you
So cute even resorts to violence like you
You kno you ya baby mama
Loose but ha what can you do
And I got 4 myself yep it's been a few
Now everything I do is for
King, messiah, dazasha, demonte
Lord they all I got so please don't take em from me
From me standin in the
Trap wit corin and sir kap
Laughin at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas man yall
Trippin wit no map
Ya robbing ask to borrow my pistol ain't no hap
Me, you, the crew just fell out ova
Dough and a little crack
Never could apolygize cause you died that's why they saying..

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I bet you niggas thinking that I living it up
Til you see polices laughing as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many bitches i can fit in the truck
To 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what fuck how
Many millions I got nigga so what if Im hot when I got prices on my head
Feds rushing my spot a million
Haters won't me dead force to carry me gat
But you a seven time felon wat you doing with dat
It's a catch
22 either you lose or lose
Thats the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never
Been a busta alway stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me
A pussy nigga
Or polices wit a warrant for me
Im a "G" prepared to die for whats important to me
Look anybody in the
Eye who say they want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to
Learn and be patient
You telling me wit these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of
Other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but
Sometime I couldn't take it
Got 4 kids wit smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my braclet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

[repeat Chorus]

Hundred thousand songs like this couldn't explain you

(chorus)
Jim Jones, what it here, homie?
Killa Cam, Freekz Zeeky, Juelz, what's happ'nin?
Hey, T.I.P., nigga
I'm up in Harlem to put it down wit my muthafuckin' folks
Dipset, bitch, a town to muthafuckin' NY, nigga
You already know what it is, Bankhead
C-Rod, Grand Hustle, Diplomats
You don't like it? Kill ya''self nigga, let's go
Late night, straight white fa' ya' base pipe
No mo' quarter O, get ya' weight right
Crack rock, black Glock kept it waist height
It hit ya'' mug you don't imagine what ya' face like
'American Pie', I'm tellin' you guys
You want beef wit us, well who the fucks preparin' you guys?
We sparin' you guys, get buried alive
What you rushin' fa'? Act like you in a hurry to die
Some I let 'em fly 'fore I let that ride
I paralize ya' like Superman's horseback ride, nigga
Walk up on ya' car an' scorch dat ride
Flat tires, glass shattered wit a corpse inside
A town break down straight pounds of dro'
Still deal if you want 10 birds or mo'
Pimp Squad, Dipset, I know ya' heard before
If we called you a bitch, you deserved it, hoe
I cop bricks of the crack an' take it to my block
Strip or my trap, my block strip is so trapped
Cops quick wit a strap, an' you'll be scared shitless
How they where the big fifth an' load up flares an' biscuits
I'll take ya' bitch from you, bring her back wit smeared lipstick
You can compare ballistics, but it's mere physics
I'm two threes on drops, I used to play hoopties on blocks
Plottin' man like who he gon' pop
In this tragic city, now I'm Bankheadin'
4 tens headin' down in A.T.L.'s Magic City
Yes, the stash is pretty an' the mag hold 50
We take ova towns, then send the Rovers 'round
Lookin' fa' hoes to pound, ya' local hoochie spot
Lookin' fa' hoochies hot to get they coochie popped
I love the titty bars, I love my niggas, pa
Dipset, Pimp Squad, yo, let's get it, pa
Yeah, already trill niggas in this bitch
U.G.K., know what I'm sayin', that's off top, fool
You already know, wreck it boyz, go down like that
What up Jones? Dipset, nigga
Bitch my Cadillac is candy an' my pistol is pearl
My best friend is a pimp an' his bottom bitch is ya' girl
I got them '84s that clank, the big diamonds that blank
Plus them hoes that pop pills, smoke kill an' sip drank
Fuck what ya' think, I'm tryin' to tell you how life
Is, give it an' take it
My lil' brotha in the pen, where niggas shiv'rin' an' shakin'
We got a million dollar team, wit one gone
So I'm takin' my 500 to flip in the game
To have somethin' for 'em when he come home
My two older brothers locked up, both of 'em smokin'
Principal's gon' be fucked up, man
My lil' nieces an' nephew heartbroken
Seein' Daddy in a cage at that age, it fuck ya' mind up
So at this stage in the game, I gots to really get my grind up
So you gon' see me in yo' city doin' a verse or a show
Or maybe even servin' one o' these niggas
A couple of dem thangs on the low
I'm Dipset affiliated, so you can hate it or love it
But it you keep pushin' ya' luck, bitch, my middle fingers' gon' shove it
Know what I'm sayin'

Said there's a party and ya gotta wear your suit
And ain't no time (time) for the D-Q

[Static]
Pass me the courvoisier

Maybe I'll tap your glass, I got some cheers for you
For they yak can't hold me back
So baby, whassup with that? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me where the party at

[Timb]
Pick it pick it pick it up

[Yoshamine]
You and I goin' do that damn thing, make it bang
You went out to the room in the back
Bring me in a Henney and a pack
Give a blunt to that fact suicide
State of mind, do or die, anytime
We can bang in the back of the 'Lac
Any damn thing bang
Do the thing in the back of the 'Lac
In the car, at the bar, gettin' high, wanna try
You went out with the heels on the block
Get the nine's all coughin'
And nigga's gon' run in our spot
Wonder why hypnotize, on my eyes and thighs
You ain't heard of me yet
But I betcha ain't met another one yet
Who do it like this
It's on, put yo hands in the air
We got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
See I'm keepin' all the party people in the place
And I'll pull another playa's parts bags
Send searchin' for sex for six packs
See I'm Simpsoning them all to the back
She even knows I'm hellerin
So they'll move till they pickin low, go over really
If I say hit his head and then hang another round
I'm showing 'em, knowing if it's a drag
That you hit it from the back and stroke
Left to the right keep it right on time
One time, two time for your mind
Better get soft layers and go over mine
Come about two chairs and go here's an ear if it's on tonight
Then this is the word I speak
Shit don't quicks mo' too tight

[Static]
I come clear to your mouth and spit many a spouse and get
Civil 'cause riddles can sizzle picks it a foul out
Package your rap attack, it's for presses and stash
They catch your track by the tail and smack they head on the nail
Factoring the jam made by Timbaland givin' fans something
Bumpin' (bumpin') and scrumpin' for your consumption
Listen close to the slick and those quick quotes
Keep gettin' dope shit, fuck with this, it'll get you so most

[Yoshamine]
When she get crucial forget about what chu used to
'cause I'm here to pay dues too, nigga put it to the back sayin'
I'mma school you on the rules to how to tell who's who
On a cruise to who's tryin' to use you
In the same sentence demention that will lose your attention
So pull mad intentions like Mag'
Lot of people gonna wanna see me stand stagnant, but it ain't gonna happen
Sound completely like Twista, or get mean like Mista'
For they feel the purple from the first time
The first rhyme that they first heard
First word, nigga's know that I'm a gold mine
Come on nigga's now lets go a time
Tell I'm in a power mood, the party groove records tour if I move it
I'mma support their dues or loose it
It's on, put yo hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, get yo hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
If I got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on

If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
If it's on, put your hands in the air
We got you in the zone, put your hands in the air
One hundred years from this day
Will the people still feel this way
And still say the things that they're saying right now?
Everyone said I'd hurt you
They said that I'd desert you
If I go away, you know I'm going to get back somehow

Nobody knows what kind of trouble we're in
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again

One hundred years from this time
Will anybody change their mind
And find out one thing or two about life?
People are always talking
You know they're always talking
Everybody's so wrong that I know it's going to work out right

Nobody knows what kind of trouble we're in
Nobody seems to think it all might happen again

[Intro]
Hot thing!
Hot thing, hot thing

Hot thing
Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, Do you want to play with me?

[Verse 2]
Hot thing, baby you dance so good
Hot thing, baby I knew you would
Hot thing, tell me what you see
Hot thing, When you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?

[Verse 3]
Hot thing, maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're going to the Crystal Ball
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late
If you're coming home at all
Hot thing, tell them you found a brand new baby doll
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing, where we can be alone
Hot thing, I could read you poetry
And then we could make a story of our own

Woah
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There's thieves in the temple tonight
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Love, if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I surely die if you're not there

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Feel like I'm looking for my soul
Like a poor man looking for gold
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Voices from the sky say
Rely on your best friend to pull you through
Even if I wanted to
I couldn't really truly
Because my only friend is you
Ooh ooh ooh ooohh
Come on

There are thieves in the temple tonight
Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart
Because me and you could've been a work of art
Thieves in the temple

Baby don't you know I'm holding on the best that I can
Love please help me be a better man
Better than the thieves in the temple tonight, in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple tonight (hurt me)

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple ohhh
"You said you loved me!"
(Thieves in the temple)
"You said I was your man!"
(Thieves in the temple)
(Love come quick)
"But they were lies! Lies!"
(Love come in a hurry)
Thieves in the temple tonight
"Ahhhh!"
Thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple

I'm holdin' on (I'm holdin' on) the best that I can
Love please, (let me be) let me be the better man
Better than the ones that wanna count me out
Better than the ones that don't know what my love's about
I'm talkin' 'bout the kinda love that can move a mountain
The kinda love that could part the sea
The kinda love that'll last forever
(no matter what u say we should be together)
You should be with me (thieves in the temple)
Yeah, you should be with me

I said I wanna know (talk to me)
One thing (talk to me)
Said I wanna know (talk to me)
I wanna know one thing, baby (talk to me)

How come you said that I was your baby
When you and your love was gonna leave
You led me on, led me on thinkin' you was Moses
Herding sheep blindly through a fantasy
You done me wrong (thieves in the temple)
And everybody knows it
Now the sound of my voice is pumpin' in your chest
More or less, I am here to tell you that
I am the best
Better than the rest
Better than the thieves in the temple tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, hurt me
(Put it in)
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple tonight

Put your foot on the rock
Let me show you how to clock

Put your foot on the rock
Let me show you how to clock

Thieves in the temple
(What the....?)

Who got the party, who got the party, who?
Who got the party, who got the party, who?
Who got the party, who got the party, who?
Who got the party, who got the party, who?

All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain...
We can be like they are
Come on, baby... don't fear the reaper
Baby, take my hand... don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly... don't fear the reaper
Baby, I'm your man...
Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity... Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday... Like Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday... Redefine happiness
Another 40,000 coming everyday... We can be like they are
Come on, baby... don't fear the reaper
Baby, take my hand... don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly... don't fear the reaper
Baby, I'm your man...
Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew then disappeared
The curtains flew then he appeared... saying don't be afraid
Come on, baby... and she had no fear
And she ran to him... then they started to fly
They looked backward and said goodbye... she had become like they are
She had taken his hand... she had become like they are
Come on, baby... don't fear the reaper
Farewell, my love
Farewell, my love
I love you more than anything
No one knows the good you bring to me
But I've got to set you free
I've just got to set you free
Oh goodbye, my love
I'm gonna cry, my love
The vow of love you've broken
The law of love has spoken to you
Oh, why couldn't you be true?
Why couldn't you be true?
So long, baby, you know, it's so hard
It's really hard to find someone in
This wide world who's really true
I guess it's just meant for me to be unhappy
But I believe, I really do believe that
Somewhere someone is waiting for me
She's there, my love
Somewhere, my love
Someone who cares
And still be there with me
Oh, my darling can't you see
How wonderful it could be, yeah?
Farewell, to you
Farewell, my love
We're through
We're through
Kill ‘em
It’s what I hear when I get a hot feel
In my nostrils
In my forehead
As I code red
You’ll be more dead than a horse head
In a four bed-
Room apartment
Bloggers that start shit
You want to criticize me?
Just so you can drink green tea
With Lykke Li at a speakeasy?
Wearing some American Apparel
While you’re staring at a Tim and Eric DVD?
Can’t get enough
Crime Mob shit: knuck if you buck
Celibate girls do stuff in the butt
Get it out with a Q-Tip, or some Müeslix
I’m a eunuch just cause I can’t give a fuck
Kiss her on her neck while she buttoning up
And my pants down
It’s funny how when I put Camp out they gotta camp out
Better than half of all rappers you have on your laptop
At your dad’s house
Hands down
Fake niggas said, “You the man now!”
Got a DJ like Roseanne’s house
Sam go hard like a handjob, nigga
Childish don’t go hard, what?
Now everybody wanna fuck with me, slut
The flow is too sick
Got them white boy clothes and that black dude dick
Now I understand why you gotta hate a nigga
East side! Stone Mountain-Decatur nigga
Y’all niggas lame, I’m fly as hell
Cause I’m fucking lame, and I don’t even care!
I'm sending red roses and violets of blue, girl (Violets of blue, girl)
The roses mean I love you
The violets mean I'll always be true, girl (Be true, girl)
Because I really love you
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do
In spite of the way you're acting that you love me too
Come on and say you do
You try to keep me away, girl
Just to prove you don't really care
But I believe you feel the same way I do
And this torture just ain't fair (No, this torture just ain't fair)

I'm sending you a bracelet engraved in gold (Sending you a bracelet baby)
That I love you girl (Love you, girl)
And I'd send my heart if I could
To prove I'll always be true girl
Because I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes I do)
In spite of the way you acting, that you love me too
Come on and say it dear
Oh, say it dear
I hope you'd understand
That the red roses and violets of blue, girl (Hope you'd understand)
And that bright shining bracelet
Helps me, baby to say I love you (I love you, love you)
And I really love you ('Cause I really love you)
And I truly, truly believe, yes I do (Yes, I do)
I believe that you love me
So baby, come on and say it, say it
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
I truly, truly believe, yes I do
I truly, truly believe, yes I do
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)
(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)

[Chorus]
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me: "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time
Ah, yes it is, it's a waste of time, ooh
Look at me

[Verse 1]
I need to get out of this city
I need to get to you out of my head
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
Oh baby
(Why you screaming? You know I'm not a man of war)
How could you think that I could put something
Inside of someone that I put inside you, inside you?
Even if I tried to, if I tried to
I couldn't 'cause I still smell like the last time that we...
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
(Waste of time)
Oh yes it is
But lovin' you a waste of time, baby, ooh

[Verse 2]
I need to feel wanted again
I need to feel love is alive
I need to hear you say that you ain't looking for another reason to make me cry
(Why you screaming? You know I'm not a man of war)
I've been trying to make you happy, baby, ever since we were sophomores
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time, oh yes it is
Oh, is a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time

[Verse 3]
(If there is no future)
If there is no future
(Then there is no past)
Then there is no past
(All we've got is right now)
All we've got is right now
Let's make it last

[Chorus]
Why you screamin'?
(Can we make it last?)
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor (Oh, throw it down)
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me: "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you outta my head
I need to
How did Lenny say: I got to get away, I got to get away
Away from the words you said to me
Tryin' to take away my dignity
Peace of mind is where I should be
Instead of this seven page letter, see
If you wanna serve me a plate of blues
I won't buy you no more shoes
Donatella lace you in dresses, still
I gets no love, but I pay the bills
I will, I will pay the bills
One hundred thousand dollars and some change
I've been trying to make you happy, baby
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
Is a waste of time

[Chorus]
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
Oh, my friends tell me: "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time
Ooh, ooh
You know I'm not a man of war
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked

I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me

You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad

The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work

So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place

'Cause I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well, two can play that game

So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend

Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred

And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two

I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick

He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate

I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-ffection-ate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist

I give you money, then you burn it, like you Madoff
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden

Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked and I mean that

But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed and it’s fuckin’ awesome
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To get stones from a rock, you've got to break it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To get bread from dough, you've got to bake it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To get water from a faucet, you've got to turn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it, earn it, earn it, earn it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To get fire from a match, you've got to strike it
Strike it, strike it, strike it, strike it
To get the feeling from a kiss, you've got to like it
Like it, like it, like it, like it
To get ashes from wood, you've got to burn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it, earn it, earn it, earn it
You've got to treat me kind, all the time
Throw the other guys right out of your mind
Yeah, yeah
Now listen
To make broken things work, you've got to fix them
Fix them, fix them, fix them, fix them
To make two things one, you've got to mix them
Mix them, mix them, mix them, mix them
To get butter from milk, you've got to churn it
And if you want my love, if you want my love
You've got to earn it, earn it, earn it, earn it
If you deserve it you can get it
I'll be glad to see you with it
Just show me that you love me
And that you're thinking of me
You can get it in a hurry
Real talk, Usher, just blaze, you know
Oh, oh
(You, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You know you're gonna need me)
And now that day's here, you man gotta shed tears, right
(You're gonna want me back)
You never miss a good thing till it leaves you
Finally I realize that I need you
I want you back, baby girl I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man I wish I woulda kept my girl
And I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh, I just wish I could find you girl, oh
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Aw baby, what you say now?
(You're gonna want me back)
And still I want you, want you
Want you, want you, want you, need you, babe
If I could rewind the time
And get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
(You're gonna want me back)
I didn't see it, I couldn't see what I was doin', babe
See baby girl I was blind
And I wish I could try
To be the man that you deserve
(You're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work
Ah, baby, you're driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh, I just wish I could find you girl, oh I
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
I'm goin' outta my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now, oh

Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it use to be
(You're gonna need me)
Oh, oh

'Cause I'm missing my baby

Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby, yeah
(You're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
I just wish I could find you girl
So I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
(You're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' outta my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
(You're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And that day's here
(You're gonna want me back)
And ya man gotta shed tears, I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizing she ain't ever coming home
(Oh, ooh, you're gonna need me, need me one day)
"Blow your horn, Maceo!"
Say it (Blow your horn, Maceo {repeated by audience})
Come on

Whatcha got on your feet, some Jordans?
Just the drums
Maceo, hit me now!

It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do do this, it's what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this

It would be absurd 2 think U've never heard of this
Talkin' shhh..., every word the turd of it
It would be ludicrous, we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we...
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this
How y'all doing in here?
How y'all doing up in here?

(...) excepting (...) 2 this
Oh still U can't reap what U missed
U couldn't resist and now U're pissed
And when it's over, it ain't over
It ain't over {repeated}
It's over
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked

I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me

You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad

The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work

So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place

'Cause I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well, two can play that game

So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend

Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred

And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two

I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick

He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate

I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-ffection-ate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist

I give you money, then you burn it, like you Madoff
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden

Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked and I mean that

But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed and it’s fuckin’ awesome

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Is it so hard to say the same thing?
And you're so weak to say the same thing
Burn a hole into your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care

[Refrain: Fox the Fox & Pharrell]
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond (All the way)
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond (Oh, oh)
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond (Precious little diamond)
Let it come to you
(Shine for me, me)

[Chorus 1: The Weeknd & Pharrell]
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Don't you shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Don't patronize
You know tonight
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
'Cuz tonight, we'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care

[Refrain: Fox the Fox, The Weeknd & Pharrell]
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (Precious little diamond)
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you (To you, girl)
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you

[Chorus 2: The Weeknd & Pharrell]
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
They're in love with this idea of love
It's a shame that they'll believe it will come
For us all, for us all
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
(I want to leave it all, girl)

[Outro: Fox the Fox, The Weeknd & Pharrell]
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you (Precious little diamond)
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond (Precious little diamond)
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you
Precious little diamond

[Intro: Eve and Prince]
Mmm, uh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
NPG, Ruff Ryders, uh
Mmm, come on
The greatest romance ever sold
Mmm, uh-huh, huh
Come on, E-V-E

[Verse 1: Eve and Prince]
Yo, your eyes seem to whisper into ecstasy
For a long time, I never let a soul next to me
Melted all over your frame and tested me
Handled it, honestly, my brain, you scrambled it (Your Adam)
You said you'd like to be my Adam, I needed that
In your life forever I stayed, but you pleaded that
Made you mine, how could you ever leave I?
E-V-E created new feelings the first believe I (Embrace what?)
Embrace your whole being, your soul I took over
I became your queen, you to me, my knight, my love solider
Enjoy my fruit, juice is abundant, I have plenty
I never had to think twice, I'm yours along for life simply
Conquer all, breathe for each other, you'll never find
Love is as warm or as deep or as enticin' as mine
I'll control you, know you, you'll die without me
Enough said, nothin' is temptin' as Eve, never doubt me
Make it alone without ya? Huh, clever
You's got the tight puller, I got the lever
Sweet drops of rain I am to your umbrella
Together we make the remix a big seller

[Chorus: Prince and Eve]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Never doubt me, come on
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Never doubt me, uh-uh (Mmm, never, ever)
Mmm, uh, come on, come on, come on
NPG
Welcome to the garden (C'mon)

[Verse 2: Prince]
One day you'll get outside the doo-rag
When you really want to contemplate this jacked up
Paranormal situation that your people got into
Can I hip you?
Long ago, who considered the outcome?
Now I'm thinking that people like you would be troublesome
And suck you in the mind tangling curriculum
Stations of play, remote control, of the landscape ('Til they both know)
Bills, bills, bills, listen to why you're quarrelsome
While forty percent of your fathers are absent
And many bail behind the opium
And the only tune you seem to wanna hum are platinum

[Pre-Chorus: Prince and Eve]
And this is where you end
This is where you end, baby (Yo)
And you and I begin (You and I begin; come on, come on)

[Chorus: Prince and Eve]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Never doubt me, come on (Woah, hey)
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Never doubt me, uh-uh (Never, ever)

[Outro: Eve and Prince]
Mmm, uh, come on, come on, come on
NPG, Ruff Ryders, uh
Come on, come on
Ooh, you like that?
Uh, come on
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Uh
It's time for Adam and Eve to unite and stop the fightin'
So let's stop the fightin', y'all
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Fearless]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

[Fearless]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why when with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

[I'm Yours]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey

[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress

I never been 1 2 hide my feelings
Baby, u blow my mind
I painted your face upon my ceiling
I stare at it all the time

I imagine myself inside your bedroom
Oh I imagine myself in your sky
(U) U are the reason there's bass in my boom
(Oh u) U are the reason I'm high
If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then i'd make u understand
That everything i wanna do 2 your body, baby
I would do 2 your head
Then u'd be hip 2 the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get 2 the space (The closer we get 2 the space)

(The space)
(The space)
(The space)
Don't u want 2 go? (The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)
Where the love grows
Do u want 2 go?

I never been 1 4 this thing obsession
But just keep your eye on my hips
The circles they may be my confession
Just say the word and I'll strip

I've had dreams of us cuddling on the planet mars
Then when i wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex
If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make u understand
That everything I wanna do 2 your body, baby
I would do 2 your head
Then u'd be hip 2 the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get 2 the space

Do u want 2 go?

[Intro: Prince]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Verse 1: Prince and Q-Tip]
So what do you know, you and me
Finally face to face
Checkin' each other up and down
In all the obvious places
All the places in the world we live
They can't hold a candle to the light you give
For real, for real
I have a outlook that's truly uncommon
And if you follow me
You're more than a honor, man
The reason why I'm placed on the earth's face
Is spitting rhymes, getting mine's
Watching your waist, hourglass
Then you give me hot flash
This romance give heat of a sonic blast

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
So this is where you end
And you and I begin

[Chorus: Prince and Pharrell Williams]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I ain't no thug tonight
I'mma stay home and make love tonight
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I ain't trying to bang
Maybe this song will help me change

[Verse 2: Prince and Q-Tip]
Now your mind is open
To poetry seldom heard
Your heart has never been broken
Until you've heard these words
Givin' off the air like your thang don't smell
You better answer all of that love
Inside your heart, right now
Shorty, look, in the scheme of it all
We could really make it work
When our back's on the wall
For real, for real
Give a week and let your man know
I'll come running
He's heartless
Hold my hand
Yo, he's just fronting
It's time now
Let's dance eternally
They looking at us laughing
But our love is what's concerning me

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
So this is where you end
This is where you end
And you and I begin

[Chorus: Prince and Pharrell Williams]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I ain't no thug tonight
I'mma stay home and make love tonight
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I ain't trying to bang
Maybe this song will help me change, c'mon
I ain't no thug tonight
I'mma stay home and make love tonight, baby
I ain't trying to bang
Maybe this song will help me change
Lemme holla at you, babe (holla, holla)

[Outro: Prince]
Oh, oh I know you can feel me
I know that you can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
Not what you think but what you believe
Can you tell me the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
I ain't gonna leave you baby

[Intro]
All this time, time, time...
All this time, time, time...

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before but

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
What the fuck do y'all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
And niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that's not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!

[Hook]
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"

[Verse: 2]
Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain't trying, I'm doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R's a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, "I'd get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man"
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y, but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bone's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with No I.D. and no I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

[Hook]
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"

[Verse 1]
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watching you
The music rocked us
Our eyes locked-thus
Making us see a trippy picture shoo

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Verse 2]
You whispered something
It took my mind out like a
G flat major with an E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted to touch your mouth
My brain is jacking all over the place

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Verse 3]
Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love
To commit the crimes of passion
That sets us free
Me loving you, you loving me
Me loving you, you loving me
The electric chair

[Verse 1 Reprise]
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watching you
The music rocked us
Our lives shocked us
Making us see a trippy picture shoot
I've got to have it
Somebody

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Outro]
You know I'm guilty, yeah
For all my future crimes
Guilty
For all my future crimes
And if you don't really love me
Then give me the electric chair, oh!
Electric chair

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
We are going in
Let's go

Grab the money fast
Blow the money quick
Rolling in the Maibach
Like I am fucking rich
Got the class
Got the stacks
We are so great
Got the stacks
Got the racks

Come to the condo, in ass and heels
Have a drink, have some pills
And make her think I'm Shaq O'Neal
If she won't tell, then I won't squeal

Dipset, Bird Gang, some real Geed up shhit
Listen
305, all the way to the top
Eh Khaled, what's good?

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Rocks like bolder game
Crazy upstate
Test the Rolls in the lane, racing up the A
We betting thousands on street corners
Roll the dice with police on us
Slow like the Henesy
Cold tonight, need the seat warmers

[?] slice 

[?]

[?]
4 door, welcome 

[?]
Heavy supercharger
Goods, no war
That's for beginners, I'm living like a winner

[Verse 2: Styles P]
You don't want a robbery, nobody trying me
Looking for some good in me, lil bit of god in me
Right now, whole lotta shit startin to bother me
Wanna see some vains spilled, shit load of arteries
Any rap motherfucker tryna say they hard as me
Tell the truth, I don't know why these niggas start with me
I been in it now, fuck a semi
Get a rocket launcher, I better shoot your Bentley or your hand me downs
Khaled, you should warn them niggas, ad an extra listen on 'm
Then figure out who make the paper that say "missing" for 'm
Layin on the top, bigger than a fishing form
Go and get your whole crew, round up the craziest
Send them here, I'll send them back and show you what the raiser did
We ain't getting paper nigga, you can meet your maker nigga
Turn you purple and yello, just like a laker nigga

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
Any cat that rap, step to me, I'd catch a felony
I just beat a murder, what the fuck these niggas telling me?
I'm not into this rap shit, practicing infedelity
These 

[?]
I could still sell a key
I'm the hustler motherfucker, I could sell a tree
To the forest, the hardest niggas is with me
Mad cause they money is funny like Bill Belomy
And wanna put a shell in me, dog but it's all jealousy
You smellin me, but you refuse to diss me
Cause I keep a tool that could fuckin remove a kidnie
I keep a 9, the same kind Shyne used for Diddy
Plus I keep the chopper, it pop when I crues the city
Just in case a nigga get wreckliss, try to test this
And I gotta knock out his breakfast out his intestines
Said I'm on his death list, I don't care what niggas bout
If I hear a nigga mouth, then Imma air a nigga out

[Verse 4: Rob Cash]
My bro Khaled said "bring the heat", birds think I got it, sweet
Cause I rode with Pistol Pete, my shit complete
I don't take it, I make it, but you can't
You can't slip, can't even kiss a freak in your Benz
Please don't try to preach
You couldn't even last a week in these damb streets
Cause you'll catch dots on your face, like acney
Do this shit for fun, you better run like a track meet
Cause you don't want the gun dumped on your tung like ass cheaks

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It’s the remix!
Ayo Raekwon, we in the jungle with this rock ‘n’ roll shit
I’ma serve the streets with that West Coast Game
I’ma serve the streets with that Pharrell
Shit, I’ma serve the streets with that Busta Rhymes
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi, you know me
How he flying in the air like we ‘Living on a Prayer’, ow
We on the corner serving that Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll, posted on the corner with the Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll

[Verse 1: The Game]
Ayo Chef, let me get my Charles Louboutin on, yeah
Smoking on this Jimi Hendrix, feeling like a rock star
I’m on the block, dawg, leaning on a cop car
Clip the ashes, daydreams of getting knocked off
Most of them niggas be clicking they Tar Heels, Montross
I’m in the Le Montrose, feeling like a mob boss
But I don’t eat spaghetti, nigga, fried wings and hot sauce
Come through the door, get crossed over like Hot Sauce
Warn from the floor, be on the floor with a locked jaw
Told y’all before, man down when them shots off
Why you think I’m leaning on the car? I pay the cops off
Coming at me is like saying toilet paper not soft
Put a hole in one of you rap niggas, not golf
Tell you like ya mama, “I’ll knock your fuckin’ block off”
Rock‘em Sock‘em Robots, you a Waka Flocka knockoff
Say he play the block but can’t get a fuckin’ rock off
Me and Chef, a.k.a. niggas you can’t knock off

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Wanna talk about getting on when I’m already on
And talking ‘bout cars that are foreign, that makes me yawn
37 years since the first day I was born
The first 17 no jew-els I don
The other 20, outlined myself like Tron
So with life is the only thing I’ll be getting on
The Obama on the arm
While y’all niggas out of time like the hour arm’s gone
How’d this mayne get this bling?
Your bitch like, “How’d this thing get that aim?”
Maybe it’s the private planes or tightest chains or
That’s just the game and I’m not playing, nigga
I shake your hands, nigga, we not y’all
You get beef, niggas’ll heat that up, and eat that up
Pssh, see, that’s us
‘Cause lyrically, nigga, I’m three gats tucked
Nigga, what

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger?
Yeah, I bet it will blast ya
Now take a hit of this Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
It’s some powerful shit

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, fuck a carpet, I’ma roll you out a new rug (Yeah)
Baby, let me introduce you to the new drug (Yeah)
Hallucinate a new visual in a new dream (That’s right)
Then sting your nostril a little like methamphetamine (Shit)
The shit I spit at you on your flesh ‘til you properly rotten
Your cold and clammy skin like you was doing Oxycontin
You see the end results of my shit could be frightening
While you try to kill the pain and I ran in like using Vicodin
Triflin’, wanting every gram that I be slicing
When I feed the street the drug to make ‘em bug and get to pricing in
While I give a Metallica dose, squeeze quick
Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, dope fiend shit (Shit)
Then turn ya to a Twisted Sister, that’s what I do with it (Damn)
Then rubber band the bread, that’s how my Motley Crue get it (Yeah)
That old powerful shit, you know that thing that’s potent (Get it)
That indescribable feeling, that thing that keep you open
We smell that lethal smoking

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger?
Yeah, I bet it will blast ya
Now take a hit of this Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
It’s some powerful shit

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Uh huh, yeah, under the building shit, word up, ayo
They say he bury his money in gold caskets
Cabinets of rap books, thrown in some bottles that’s drastic
Scientists of war, flows mastered, everybody notice
The rap elite emerge from a grass clique
Gangstas in Polo gloves, no Lugz, Wallabees successes
I be so obsessed with the plugs
Making money, that’s the novel, Adidas sneaker, lethal reefer
Glass cutter, Cecil, that’s the heat, AK pop off
Green beret on, 40 belows, shoulder ratchet on
Low pullover in the hallway, not asking
Finish killing these little weight niggas
Fuck around, get outta place, I’ma do the haircuts and shape niggas
Bubblegum weed spot, last door at the ski shop
The sequel, come smoke with me and my people
We live like them rollers and Vikings
We known for fighting, come float with me like indictments

[Chorus: Kobe Honeycutt]
Hey, lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi, you know me
How he flying in the air like we ‘Living on a Prayer’, ow
We on the corner serving that Rock ‘n’ Roll, Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll, posted on the corner with the Rock ‘n’ Roll
Rock ‘n’ Roll

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It's DJ Khaled, we the best
Shareefa, let's take it to the ghetto

[Chorus: Shareefa]
Oh my god, this life so crazy
Hustling to feed our babys
Times get hard, indeed I know
Raised without anything
Go for mine, don't wait for nobody
Tell me who want it, cause nigga I got it
DTP, oh yes it's me
Second time I'm Disturbing Tha Peace

[Verse 1: Shareefa]
Talk is cheap, these bitches ain't valid
She in my lane, nigga I doubt it
Bout my bread, I'm chacing my doe
Always keep your enomies close
Down to ride, your people get ready
That be me in a pimped out Chevy
DTP, oh yes it's me
You can't stop me now, cause I'm hot right now
You can't stop me, no, you can't hold me back
Everytime I try to leave, these suckers pull me back

[Chorus: Shareefa]
Oh my god, this life so crazy
Hustling to feed our babys
Times get hard, indeed I know
Raised without anything
Go for mine, don't wait for nobody
Tell me who want it, cause nigga I got it
DTP, oh yes it's me
Second time I'm Disturbing Tha Peace

[Verse 2: Willy Northpole]
On the street corner, got a duffle bag, boy
A bag of chips, call me the Ruffle bag boy
Yes I'm Cyrus, a hustler's virus
I'm infected, injected, money, power, respected
Necklace gloabal, wreckless flow
X's and Os, thug in the streets
Willy ruthlis, DTP, the money is stupid like dufis
Drop the roof is
The proof is I'm nice in the booth
Rappers get booted right in they tooth
If rappers want to, might as well shoot this
Back on it on the north with the Reefer
An Internet popper, and I can delete ya
I'm from the streets with killers and creatures
And I'm a drug dealer preacher

[Chorus: Shareefa]
Oh my god, this life so crazy
Hustling to feed our babys
Times get hard, indeed I know
Raised without anything
Go for mine, don't wait for nobody
Tell me who want it, cause nigga I got it
DTP, oh yes it's me
Second time I'm Disturbing Tha Peace

[Intro]
When you say in your mind that it's all the time
And you hope that you floated through the larger line
On the gaudy side of town
On the gaudy side of town

[Verse]
I'm not your money man
A thin coated satellite
And you wouldn't leave me, would you dear?
Not tonight
We see your back and forth
Fear in the company now
Put some fear in the company now
Don't lose your cold dear
Fear in the company now
Keep it right

[Outro]
She come in alone
A firestorm
Waitin' on a spark
Leaving me alone she feels it after dark
Keep it down boys
The fire inside
Figure it out sort it out
Your foot in the mouth

[Intro: Game]
(For a taste of your love, for a taste of your love
Just a little taste of your love and your life)
I just want to be known as one of the greatest
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1: Game]
See my mother was a hustler, my father was a gambler
And that made me a scrambler
My grandmother named me game I'm not a amateur
Creep up on my phantom and, I might blam at ya
Hood niggas put your hammers up
A million thugs march picture that with a camera
Damn picture me Floyd Mayweather stamina
Riding with a stallion
Something cute with an Atlanta butt
I could go hammer but I'm not broke
Picture me getting a million dollars for every line I wrote
I'm dope, When J gon' do a song with me
I ain't dope I mean what the fuck is wrong with me?
You act like my polo boxers is a thong you see
I beat on these rappers, hip-hop is Donkey Kong to me
And while we're talking about video games
I'm prestige on Call of Duty, press L2 and aim

[Chorus: Game]
When we see you stop at the red light
And you got your guns on you, what you gon' do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk
When you see me making it rain inside the club
And you mad nigga what you gon do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk

[Verse 2: Game]
I'm not a game you niggas is so lame
My 40 is so aim I will ckk ckk ckk
And if your kids in the car I don't mind waiting
I got 2 sons, I'm not a daddy spending time hater
Got your license plates so you ain't hard to find later
And I got a movie premiere to do so so it'll be some time later
I know the shit coming out of my mouth make the crime grater
But when your the game sometimes you've gotta remind haters
Got niggas that'll find haters
Take you to the LA zoo and feed your punk ass to nine 'gators
I'm an animal, cannibal, can I bust?
Here come LL, don't do it Game trust
This the nigga that rip Mobb Deep
He put the O in O.G
J&J but to win that you got to show me
Matter fact, young Hov gotta show B
That you the greatest of all time
Nigga that's you and Ghost beef

[Chorus: Game]
When we see you stop at the red light
And you got your guns on you, what you gon' do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk
When you see me making it rain inside the club
And you mad nigga what you gon do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk

[Verse 3: Game]
I got a couple rap homies and a lot of rap enemies
But ain't none of you rap motherfuckers no kin to me
Barrel to your throat if you trait on I
Ever disrespect Snoop or, hate on Nas
I'm like the ink then the ink pen
The Juice when you think Gin
I spit bars but nigga, I never think pen'
I only think pen when, when my ass clinked in
And If I'm ever clinked in again let me sink in
I'm so Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio Da Vinci
Just painted the Mona Lisa
My paint brush empty like the mouths in the ghetto
I can see it, my new house just miles from the ghetto
Young black entrepreneur like Cosby and his Jello
Everyone watching Kobe what about L.O.?
Nigga average 14.2 points a game, 10.6 rebounds
3.5 assists, while still on the block
You silly NBA motherfuckers won't even take notice
Man that's fucked up nigga
If that ain't an all-star then what the fuck is?

[Chorus: Game]
When we see you stop at the red light
And you got your guns on you, what you gon' do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk
When you see me making it rain inside the club
And you mad nigga what you gon do?
Game recognize game I will cock and aim
And ckk ckk, my niggas will ckk ckk

[Outro: Game]
Keep thinking I'm a motherfucking game nigga
I play solitaire with this hip-hop shit
Play by my motherfucking self
Keep trying to play me like I'm a chessboard
Imma take your fucking queen nigga
And you know what you can do?
King me
It's so incredible, uhh
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

[Chorus: Dre]

Plenty choppers hit the spot, let's pull a chopper out and chop ya
Helicopter, you fuckers, that's why I keep my chopper

[Verse 1: C-Ride]
I ain't got Rotweilers that shoot gunpowder up
I got gun power, you deuce, just power it up
Hoes, I'll pile you up
Like up against the wall
Lined up against the wall
Like some vegetable
Oops, I mean the bitch, but y'all like vegetables
The Coupe, I see through it
Put red beams through it
Put some squeeze to it
Catch amnesia quick
Sure, I sleep with it
It's that team spirit
I mix some Big with it, a little 2Pac
That Makavelli
That's what I play when they shoot shit up
Yep it's news to us

[Chorus: Dre]
I got a  chopper for the magnom
Chopper for the Chevy
Got a chopper in the kitchen by the stove, I call it Betty

[Verse 2: Joe Hound]
Nigga I got keys of Coke, big guns I toat
Big boys used to blow
Big blunts you need to smoke

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say, Get over here
And play a video game

I'm in his favourite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favourite perfume on
Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do
Now you do, now you do, now you do
Now you do, now you do, now you do

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now you do, now you do, now you do
Now you do
Now you do, now you do, now you do

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yeah, I'm ecstatic for love
Fanatic of love
And if I'm not around
It's you I'm thinkin' of
I gotta make it real for you
Whenever I deal wit you
I do do do do anything

[Verse 1]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
So I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see, yeah
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go
Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up

[Verse 2]
My friends wonder what is wrong with me, yeah
'Cause I'm in a daze from your love, you see
So I came back to let you know
Oh, I got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Although I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything
But you don't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yeah, come on now, listen
Through the ghetto in the projects of Queens
I gotta get to you 'cause you do them things to me
My love shows
Nobody knows how my adrenaline flows and to the heights it goes
And ayo, see, 'cause when you're filling me up
You're enough, when you're ready for that nut
Babe, I'll be that buttercup
And I catch every drop
You got a chick on lock for you
I'll go through the storm and skip to the road blocks
We can rumble in cuss
We can fight and we can fuss
But know that I'm never giving up
It's nothing I won't do
Nothing I won't go through
You're worth the joy and the pain
I'ma keep it true

[Chorus]
What you won't do
Do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
Cause you've flown away, so far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feelin', knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darlin' I never showed you (no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (but I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day
(eventually we will sing in heaven)

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day (one sweet day)

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
(I know you're looking down from heaven)
And I know eventually we'll be together
Yes we will
One sweet day

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say

[Intro: All]
Yo, fellas, y'all ready to do this?
Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men

[Chorus: All]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Verse 1: Nathan & Mike]
It's long overdue but now Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat (Nah)
While cooling on South Street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat

[Verse 2: Wanya & (Shawn)]
Back in school we used to dream about this every day
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you

[Chorus: All]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Yo, these four new jacks is real smooth on the harmony tip
Nate, Mike, Shawn and Wan
You know the mentality
Keep flippin' the gift

[Verse 3: Shawn & Nathan]
The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
Da da, da da da, da da da da da da
Live and direct from Phillytown
Rap and hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll, so now the world will know that we were

[Verse 4: Wanya & All]
Back in school we used to dream about this every day
Could it really happen? Or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing, and they said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

[Chorus: All]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Bridge: All]
Then we started Boyz II Men
Then we started Boyz II Men
Then we started Boyz II Men
Then we started Boyz II Men
Then we started Boyz II Men
Then we started Boyz II Men
Then we started singing and they said it sounded smooth

[Verse 5: Mike]
Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing
They came up to me, I said, "Well, what's your name?
(Boyz II Men) Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Then I said, "Alright fellas, well, let me see what you can do"
And then, with a smile, Wanya said "Yo, Mike
Check this out, see if this one moves you"

[Chorus: All]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Intro: Shawn Stockman]
More than you'll ever know

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
I know a lot of years have passed us
But I still love you more than you'll ever know
There was a time I felt it wouldn't last us
And baby, how I felt, I didn't show
Sometimes I took you for granted
And thought that you would understand it
But through it all we managed to make it through tough times

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
No, no, I can't imagine not having you by my side
Everything you are and all you do
I'm still in love with you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
More than you'll ever know (Ever know)
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
And to this day I still get butterflies
Know that I love you more than you will ever know

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson]
Sometimes I watch you sleeping
Kiss you and fall in love all over again
In the morning when you're leaving
I start to miss my best friend
You're my better half, like a twin
You complete my words when I begin
We don't have to be validated
With love we'll always make it

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson, Boyz II Men]
No, I can't imagine not having you by my side
(You by my side)
Everything you are and all you do
I'm still in love with you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men & Charlie Wilson]
More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
More than you'll ever know (Ever know)
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
And to this day I still get butterflies (Ooh wee)
Know that I love you more than you will ever know

[Bridge: Wanya Morris, Charlie Wilson, Boyz II Men]
See, I don't never wanna be without you
To me, you're one of a kind
(To me, you're one of a kind)
You're my everything (Everything)
Girl, you're my-my-my-my-my sunshine, oh
Know you stood with me
Behind me through tough times
I'm so glad that you are mine
Knowing you're my ride or die
I love you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men & Charlie Wilson, Charlie Wilson, Wanya Morris]
More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
(Stars in a thousand skies)
More than you'll ever know
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
(Still number one in my eyes)
And to this day I still get butterflies (Butterflies)
Know that I love you more than you will ever know
More than you'll ever know
Just like the stars in a thousand skies
More than you'll ever know
Deeper than a place where the ocean floor lies
You're still number one in my eyes
(Still number one in my eyes)
And to this day I still get butterflies (Butterflies)
(Girl, I get butterflies)
Know that I love you more than you will ever know
Lala-dada-dada-dada-dada-lala
Lala-dada-dada-dada-dada-lala
Lala-dada-dada-dada-dada-lala
Lala-dada-dada-dada-dada-lala

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
Looking out
Into the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight, no
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, just tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
La-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris]
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
And she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
And if they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, just tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

Lala-dada-dada-dada-dada-lala
Lala-dada-dada-dada-dada-lala

[Verse 3: Wanya Morris]
Looking out
Across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, just tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
Why, why, tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
Why, why, just tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa, whoa
Whoa
Don't be afraid
Now there's no hitch

Even from across the sea (so far across the sea)
I can hear you callin' me (baby, come to me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)

I know the way I feel 'bout you will last
Oh, yes, it's gonna last and stand the test of time
So your search for love is about to end
Your future holds a place where true love begins

Even from across the sea (so far across the sea)
I can hear you callin' me (baby, come to me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)
Take a romantic journey, just start a new beginning
You won't no where you're goin' till you're there
Is it just physical or is it lasting love
Please don't give up, we won't know unless we try

Even from across the sea (so far across the sea)
I can hear you callin' me (baby, come to me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)

Oh
Don't be afraid
(don't be afraid)
That's what dreams are made of
(don't be afraid to love)

Even from across the sea (so far across the sea)
I can hear you callin' me (I hear you callin' me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)

(so far away)
I can hear you callin' me (my stella's callin' me)
Destiny controls the air (no matter where you are)
Dream and dare to love again (your home is in my heart)
Stella
No matter where you are
No matter how far you go
I'll be there
(stella)

[yung wun]
Man, y'all rap niggas is high fashion
Flashin, talker, no action
Read emcees like tv's with captions
Charts we smash on, guns we blast them
Spit fire like blow dryers and drag dash on
Your career won't last long, real name shawn lassiter
Four words for y'all, f type no passenger
Flow nastier, man you know what i mean
And i keep them diamonds shinin blue, yellow, and green
So the wrist look like a twister mat
Man, i cock the biscuit back and twist ya cap
Opps, clipped ya face just missed ya hat
This go out to those that think this just a rap
Well mister, address the gat and we'll address ya back
Nasty, nasty, spittin discusting raps
And i doubt that cha'll cats can fuck with that

[Chorus:]
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
These ryde or die boyz will rough you up
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
These ryde or die boyz will touch you up
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
These ryde or die boyz will bust you up
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
You don't want no drummer boy

[larsiny]
I hate cops, and i like you even less
I turn your whole block into a bleedin mess
Niggas talk hard, and get an easy death
'cuz i pop buck shots like i'm ???
And i can tell you won't blow, gotta scary finger
All talk, no show, jerry springer
I don't care if you a skinny or a burly nigga
I'ma have ya face lookin like a blurry mirror
We shake your features, y'all make believers
And the eight'll make you shake like you fake the seizure
I ball of the scale, break the meter
And if you ever go to jail, they'll rape and beat'cha
Hold up, take a breather, i'm way too tough
Got kicked outta pre-school, played to rough
I straight grew up, i'm still a bully
Used to take your lunch money now i steal your jewelry

Ha, okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Chorus]

[yung wun]
Don't make me reach for these, i got heat to squeeze
Make your face melt like pizza cheese
You need to leave, 'cuz you don't stand a chance man
I get greasy like mechanic hands
Y'all niggas all sweet like candy yams
Clear blocks outs, hop out the family van
Lookin like a handy man, with tools on the waist
Put'choo in the ambulance with two's in your face
You'se a disgrace, you've never been hot
And i can tell how you talkin you ain't never been shot
Yo, its whatever or not, if you want it, its war
You can choose what i'ma use, the pump or the four
Then decide where you gon' die, trunk of the floor
'cuz i'ma tell the law i don't know nothing at all
I was just walkin my dog and discovered the ball
A lotta niggas think they hard, this is somethin for y'all

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
How do I say goodbye
To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad

[Chorus]
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

[Verse 2]
I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through, ooh

[Chorus]
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

[Chorus]
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

Verse one: wyclef
You wanna battle swing I bring commanding men like I was king
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of stephen king
Cling to false also those papers say ock
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-cause I love thee
If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun
Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits it
I was ordered to code red, but now I'm chillin with a few good men
Assassination on the kid from the capitol
I never play the soap opera but now I'm a general hospital
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical
So if I die, catch me at the funeral
I'll fly away, ohh glory
With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me
And the angels write raps on holy paper
I said I'm lookin for jesus, he said take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed you'll be there
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there
So, mona lisa, could I get a date on friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, fugee comin around de way
Verse two: lauryn hill
I don't puff blunts so I always got my breath
Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest
They call me cock-weasel but i, still cave a chest
I don't wear jheri curls cause I'm nah from the west
No disrespect to the west, true indeed
I rock it to the east, the east is the seed
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and hot tracks
Peace to mr. magic, things are getting tragic
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the ku kluk
My own clan is actin up, I blame it on the phillie blunt
Whatcha gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh
Hill is gettin fed up, yo where's the coporate at
A mister three piece suit
Check the square roots, girbauds and timberland boots
Nahhhh that's the serpents, and know them garment tips
I got a head full of problems and a hand full of nappy roots
I feel a jones' comin down, yo i...
(I got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy head bang)
No i, got hte slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy heads bang

(yo mona lisa, could I get a date on friday
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking

Round up de posse, fugee comin round de way
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Nappy heads in the zone and we're not goin home!)
Verse three: prazwell, wyclef
Hey yo a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle
If it'sssssssssss snake doesn't rattle
Cause my style's as old as a reptile
As slick as a new nile, as new as a new child
So come follow me to the land of abraham
This land's your land, this land's my land
The blacker the black man, the better the next man
(yo some nappy heads need to check they necks for red)

Ihhhh, feel injection
Put the needle to your skin feel reality's heroin
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
Oh you wanna hang with old eddie kane? (the five heartbeats)
Ain't nuttin wrong, snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like louis armstrong
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world
But what the hell was so wonderful bout cotton in the farm
Mr. slaaaaaave maaaaan!
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one come all
Don't stall or i'ma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop drawer for the count who drops
You slept on a kid from the boondocks
Out of motorville land of the ill kill
Bellsburg viking so you know I'm top ranking phil
Some say who coming like like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-two
When I used to rock my pumas...
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a libra y'all (4x)

Yo mona lisa, could I get a date on friday
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking

Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, this is the Fugees
Refugees
About to take you on a journey
Into the dimensions of the Booka basement
The basement, word
Uhh

[Refrain: Lauryn Hill]
Hey yo, one two three! The crew is called Re-Fu-Ge-ee-es
An if yu come fa tes the rap stylee
Stop the violence and just bring it on, willld

[Verse: Lauryn Hill]
Hey yo I, feel kind of melancholy people think they really know me
I keep a wrap about me while I'm driving daddy's Audi
I pay the toll fighting for my own soul
Cause the bourgeoise type of mental sucks like a flat comb
But I be baitin the rebel base to bass distort the EQ
The devil's wishin they could send me back to Mogadishu
Cause I've been wild since I was a juvenile
Afro-centric profile, back when righteous rap was your style
Now kids are whylin so I ask the bad black
Boogie bandit, what's the damage, gimme the estimate then
Pray tell me when's the revolution will begin?
I turn on my TV I check out Farrakhan on CNN see
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird do
And things you never heard plus I come from the suburbs
Word to God, I heard you're acting kind of hard
And you got your skin scarred when they was shootin on the boulevard

[Chorus: (Lauryn Hill) & Fugees]
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(On the real got the vocab) You know we got the vocab
(All my peeps got the vocab) Yeah, we got the vocab
(Lauryn) Aiyyo Praz, grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab

[Verse: Pras]
Then cast off from here to Mexico
You see my four-five-six a-be my Celo
And when I rest my head is on a pillow
Be-ba-dee-be, be-dee-be, be-dee-be-bo
You see the skills I manifest is very tho-rough
And if you don't believe me ask Freres Ja-cques
Mmmm, Freres Jacques, Freres Jacques
A dorme vous? A dorme vous?
WATCH OUT NOW! When I choose to speak
I'm forming the cipher fly East to the Five Percenter
Knowledge is born, to all beginners
Cast the first stone, if you feel you ain't a sinner, ahh
Say o-ur father, who art in heaven
Forgive the foolish rapper for he not know how Fugee be steppin
Correct and, stopped and kept in, nuff respect to the
DJ, that be selectin, the type of record ahhh

[Chorus: (Pras) & Fugees]
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(The click's got the vocab) You know they got vocab

(Lauryn) Aiyyo Clef grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab

[Verse: Wyclef]
Check it out, here we go
Back in Eighty-TREE, no one wanted to be NAPPY
I turn on my TV, it's a dreadlock for FREE
Kill the gimmick
It's nonsense, it's no sense or value
A rapper, disaster, nobody ever told me that
"Roxanne, you don't got to work for money no more!!"... and...
Back in the days I used to listen to Kool G Rap
Way back when before guns became gats and
Run-D.M.C. used to ask Mary was she buggin?
I loved P.E., they kept me concious of what I was saying
Afrika Bambaata, Poor Righteous Teacher
Got within myself so it made me a Five Percenter
Say La-Di-Da-Di, UHH! we like to party but
My jam was BDP, with My Philosophy
Say Grandmaster Flash, MC Melle Mel
Then LL Cool J came with Rock the Bells!
See I'm the one for the crew, like a Jew is a Jew
Like Apollo got the moon, like the men who got the blue
Like the Fu got the Manchu, Chaka got the Zulu
Hawaii got the Honolulu
I got the rap lieu, so skippedy-de-bop-bop you don't stop
You do the rock-rock from hip-hop through be-bop
From be-bop to bee-bee

[Chorus: (Lauryn Hill) & Fugees]
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(Boogie Down got the vocab) You know they got the vocab
(Black people got the vocab) Word, we got the vocab
(Lauryn) Aiyyo peeps, grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab

Hey, yo pass the mic so I can tell 'em I got the gift o' gab
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself. (x3)
Hey yo catch me when I'm sober, but now I drink for the belt
So pass the root straight to the right hand side
Make no mistake that the buzz is a natural high
I said it's big emergency mind your busy body
He hit me. I broke his nose. The referee's Mr Fuji
So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here
So now when I back track
I back track far enough to make a nigga run and leave his tongue back
You think I'm cool I think you're cruel so here's a shell cap
On your gluteus maximus and leave ya handicapped
Ratatatat
Chorus

Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?) (x3)
Boat people here we go Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho Yeah
Some quest for the truth, some bust a loop
And search for some knowledge that come runnin' in the woods
And if I should a choose to be one
Then I will be a ???? hoodin' with books and look to kill
My proof is in my puddin'
If I chill in the hood would you be say that I'm hoodin'?
Now. Let me exercise a new style that will brutalise
MCs into a warpath genocide
Nobody move, nobody get hurt. It's a homocide
So jump jump punks ready to get stuck
Evil Kenevil was my man, someone for the stunts
I'm mostly fillies, I'm just straight up front, ha
Meat ya tryin' to light up you get blast like nitrogen
Runnin' for mercy, runnin' for oxygen
Bad L.A. meat you're better off comittin' suicide
I shoot the lip so high I strip you of your carbon dioxide
Rock-a-bye the lullaby he be singin' 'Oh my'
Boof Baff another son a go die
What's the matter with the black man? (Black man) (x2)
Now a statistic. So dreams of her become realistic

Poor bastard gets mystic I don't believe you checked the psychic
Emancipate your mind. Don't set the limit. Reach the summit
Free your spirit 'cause your blunted
From the lyrics I just stuttered
'Live off the streets' says the brother with the machete
'Live off the lady' says the brother with the Glock in patrol
I live logically, no weak slave to poverty
You see it's very easy to slip between the asphalt sheet
Brothers from my way they used to get mad plays
Till they caught us bustin' doughnuts 'til the break of day
Brother, my brother, you played me undercover
She wouldn't be your lover so now you tried to dis her
For sister. You missed her but ask yourself a question
Can I make a suggestion? I need a true confession
Is she skivs 'cause the skin that she's in makes you sin?
Does you hit her just to get her integrate another sister?
Mister. I asked him for a hanky. He asked if he could spank me
So why'd you disrespect me, sir?
Were you thinking I'm misguided or were you tryin to hide it
That you had no father figure
Which? Check out your wackness. It won't distrust my blackness
I wonder for a smack, but don't think that it would help this
What's the matter with the black man (Black man)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha) (x2)
Come jackin' it up an' I bad an' me fell in ma booby trap
With a rappin' up for the eight track play back laid back sit back
An I'll ???? an me runnin' ???? as a matter a fact
'Cause I trappin' a back like a cool six pack now bring it back. Woah!
United we stand, divided we crumble
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall (x2)
These days every man want to be a god
Lay down the gun every man on the floor
But the real gunman him not play Hollywood role
Because he pull out his gun and send another boy down
Watch us bleed. Another gunman go bleed
Watch us bleed. If I used up all my dust I got ????
Watch us bleed. Me up an' comin' ready
Watch us bleed. Watch us for original Tranzlator Crew
Oh, er, every time we come, we come correct, see
We out

Hey, yo pass the mic so I can tell 'em I got the gift o' gab
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself. (x3)
Hey yo catch me when I'm sober, but now I drink for the belt
So pass the root straight to the right hand side
Make no mistake that the buzz is a natural high
I said it's big emergency mind your busy body
He hit me. I broke his nose. The referee's Mr Fuji
So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here
So now when I back track
I back track far enough to make a nigga run and leave his tongue back
You think I'm cool I think you're cruel so here's a shell cap
On your gluteus maximus and leave ya handicapped
Ratatatat
Chorus

Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?) (x3)
Boat people here we go Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho Yeah

Then I will be a ???? hoodin' with books and look to kill
My proof is in my puddin'
If I chill in the hood would you be say that I'm hoodin'?
Now. Let me exercise a new style that will brutalise
MCs into a warpath genocide
Nobody move, nobody get hurt. It's a homocide
So jump jump punks ready to get stuck
Evil Kenevil was my man, someone for the stunts
I'm mostly fillies, I'm just straight up front, ha
Meat ya tryin' to light up you get blast like nitrogen
Runnin' for mercy, runnin' for oxygen
Bad L.A. meat you're better off comittin' suicide
I shoot the lip so high I strip you of your carbon dioxide
Rock-a-bye the lullaby he be singin' 'Oh my'
Boof Baff another son a go die

Oh, er, every time we come, we come correct, see
We out
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just bein hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Comin to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasonin, speakin wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
I see you D-12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely
I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!
Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...
...Go to sleep bitch!

We got you niggas, nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless
You'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please
You'se curtains, you use words, cool heard, slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the debt
Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...
...Go to sleep bitch!

Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin New York wit the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy-going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?
Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! (what?)

(Intro: Wyclef Jean)
Yo', check it out, I want all the refugees out there
To just put up your motherfuckin' hands, you know you're a fuckin' immigrant
Put up your hands youknowhatI'msayin'?
I'ma start this shit off like this, this time around

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah

(Wyclef Jean)
If you wanna snap (SNAP), if you wanna crack (CRACK)
If you wanna shoot, give me a second so I can lay flat
Cause this, some the cemetary's, the reality
Where the tough guys get buried in their property
Word to Sampson, the tone will get you hung
I had a friend, they murdered his father and his three-year-old son
I heard him cursin' the essence of the, the (PAUSE) committed the crime
But ah, murder got no time
The country has no law, it's either rich or poor
I'm out the back door, I got nuttin' to fight for
I'm sailin' on a boat like a goat - I clear my throat
When I got to Brooklyn, I was broke, so I selled coke
I look in through microscope, for my country and the hurt
My eyes bleed, I see Aaron Steed, the Haitian Pope
Figure or Dundee, the-riginal Malcom X
Swing like the ki's, so should I put on David Tomerfest
Though I'm humberlicious strugglin' to jump
Let me blow her upper-her bubble in your face - that'cha ego!
Aiyyo, freeze-funk, you got to stay stable
Watch out for the devil, he comes after you after the revival
When will he come, what will he do, what will he say?
That's all a mystery, but have your hand grenade
So you can blow the motherfucker away
Beep, beep, I gotta make a sale so I can eat
So Praswell, grab the mic and be complete
(Pras)
Huh, lovin' the wreck in effect, will be all in checkmate
Another style for Praswell to translate
For those who can't relate to stay down my - no-man wait
No mistake, when I tell you, your prophet is a fake

(Wyclef Jean)
You said a contract on a Haitian, three-hundred g's
Your sharpshooters are lousy, we mend to-high-be-high hoodies
So show your face-a when you waste, I know who's smokin'
The bigger that you try to put out yours just makes me Mr. Nobody
Take high wit'cha just right, it'll be like Michael get ordered, a viper you know!!
Yeah, a viper cause you might lose a life to the side by like
What did I have to in the line of the barkin' of the bright side
You tried to scare me but I won't mover-a
The bully of the block becomes the hour of the Glock
So cuckoo!! The sounds I run are rollin' with the bodyguard
But don't forget the day it's sunny but it'll be foggy

And in the funeral, you'll be singin' a new tune
May your soul rest on the moon (?Jack in wood spoon!!?)
In Channel Seven, you said: "Death before Cut"
You killed so many that your conscience ended up - whattup? (WHAT!!)
Aiyyo black men, you're dyin' by a dozen cousin
So all I do is walk away yo' Prince as if nothin' happened
You call me a punk, I gotta step cause all you did was flex
But don't get closer cause the kid still gotta keep his rep
See I'm known for the crew like the jewel was the jewel
Like the follow got the boo, like the miller got the boo
Let the fool cop the man-jewel, suck up, up the ?cool-lew?
Oh why you got the ha-ha-lew-lew?
I got the rap loose, so sci-bi-dee-bob-bob, you don't stop
You do the rap-rap, from hip-hop to be-bop, from be-bop
To beep-beep, the Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off beep-beep
I gotta make a sale so I can eat, beep, beep
The Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off, you know I got no time to sleep, so beep-beep
(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, YEAH!!
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah

(Pras)
Man, I went to cops the other day to plead for my innocence
They brought me in another charges of a legal residents
And L-E-N, on a foreign land, a ????
Watch me go back to my land and then there will be a thing
Gorillas in the mist, where everything, and the light becomes a priest
They put up they guard, they pump up they fists
Now I'm number one on they motherfuckin' hit-list...
Goin' down for first degree of manslaughter
Makin' change out of emcee's makin' them outta quarters
That's they value, that's what they worth
Cause the first shall be last and the last shall be first, yeah
What we learned was to burn, now cause you c-came
With that machette, it's your turn
It's not funny, but twenty a month is what you earn baby
(We on to the Yankee, pass the mic to the "Yankee")

(Lauryn Hill)
Well I'm as cool to ya the mic I'm checkin' comin' from my temple
With a message, to deliver, but the back is very simple
I'm the girl "Yankee" rollin' wit' the kids from Haiti
Coolin' as a mighty grab who gets the last laugh hahaha...
You bite size with my Haitian from they stinks as my "Yankee"
Wonderin' who was the first to pull over girl as soon as it came out son
My history - a hypocrite, so what we gonna do?
The dope is dope is only get the man since that is true
So hip-hip with my lip as I rip with a felt tip
With a righteous situation, interpretation, a graduation
Your ventilation, and education, segregation, emancipation
A capitalization, it's agration, not separation, ya breath the Haitians...
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I...
Chorus
You got the vocab

So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here

Now a statistic. So dreams of her become realistic

Poor bastard gets mystic I don't believe you checked the psychic
Emancipate your mind. Don't set the limit. Reach the summit
Free your spirit 'cause your blunted
From the lyrics I just stuttered
'Live off the streets' says the brother with the machete
'Live off the lady' says the brother with the Glock in patrol
I live logically, no weak slave to poverty
You see it's very easy to slip between the asphalt sheet
Brothers from my way they used to get mad plays
Till they caught us bustin' doughnuts 'til the break of day
Brother, my brother, you played me undercover
She wouldn't be your lover so now you tried to dis her
For sister. You missed her but ask yourself a question
Can I make a suggestion? I need a true confession
Is she skivs 'cause the skin that she's in makes you sin?
Does you hit her just to get her integrate another sister?
Mister. I asked him for a hanky. He asked if he could spank me
So why'd you disrespect me, sir?
Were you thinking I'm misguided or were you tryin to hide it
That you had no father figure
Which? Check out your wackness. It won't distrust my blackness
I wonder for a smack, but don't think that it would help this
What's the matter with the black man (Black man)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha) (x2)
Come jackin' it up an' I bad an' me fell in ma booby trap
With a rappin' up for the eight track play back laid back sit back

'Cause I trappin' a back like a cool six pack now bring it back. Woah!
United we stand, divided we crumble
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall (x2)
These days every man want to be a god
Lay down the gun every man on the floor
But the real gunman him not play Hollywood role
Because he pull out his gun and send another boy down
Watch us bleed. Another gunman go bleed
Watch us bleed. If I used up all my dust I got ????
Watch us bleed. Me up an' comin' ready
Watch us bleed. Watch us for original Tranzlator Crew
Oh, er, every time we come, we come correct, see

Why am I trapped in a cage? (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Barber can I get a fade? (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Teacher teacher check my grades (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I grab the mic in a RAGE...

You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
"You sure you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?" (The Five Heartbeats)
Ain't nuttin wrong, so snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
And I say to myself, WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD
But what the fuck was so wonderful bout pickin cotton -- on a farm?
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one come all
Don't stall or I'ma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop draw for the count, who drops?
Ten-nine-eight-seven-six-five-four-three-two-one-
-you-slept-on-a-kid-from-the-boondocks
Out of Hooterville land of the ill kill
Bellsburg Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say newcomer like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-three
When I used to rock my Pumas
Rap, narcotic psychotic so hear the sentencin
One out of ten, I'm passin the mic next time I'll get WICKED
Heard the man who went before, got intimated
You tried to gas me up, too much gas, you got intoxicated
You wasn't ready for the real'n, dealin, chillin
Wyclef, no competition when I'm bringin pure death
I'm jumpin like a monkey to get mines off
A-from a caterpillar, to the mic moth
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Teacher teacher check my grades (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I coulda sworn I had an A (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I grab the mic in a RAGE...

[Pras]
You put, one and one together now you think you a rapper
Baseball cap backward, forearms swingin like a hip-hopper
You do the rhyme, thinkin no one can stop ya
I be the followin that chop ya down as I clock ya, hah
When I say five-oh, I mean fifty not guns or cops
Now here's the heavyweight knocker, the freedom fighter
Natural rhythm rock a mic I always rhyme I'm never drinkin vodka
Any old style, I throw it in a locker

[Lauryn Hill]
Well I'm a Gucci rocker, I never drank no vodka
Me got no bag of cheeba cause I never had a knocker
My cousin's name was Shaka, for short we called him 'Aka
I flip it on wack MC's because to me they flow like caca

[Pras]
You boogie move the groove, nothing to prove you lose
Your style remind of yesterday, old news
Sad sung blues who's, chose the one to feel the pain
Or bring the cane, tick-tock I come to pick your lock
It's not for capital gain
So watch out for the remain, or cry from bloodstain
Bustin nuts, bustin style
Gettin buckwild some think I'm the descendant of a wilder child
Comin on the mic, from a higher level
Broke is no joke/choke the hell out of the devil

[Wyclef]
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
What about Martin? (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
What about Malcolm? (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Rosa Parks? (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
You hung a man after dark (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Cease the violence! (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)

Yo who got the power, to make a man raise from the dead?
Some said that it was Jesus, they said he was a notty dread
But I don't mean to confuse a world that's confused
Mind's atomic, so like a bomb, let me drop it
Can't get too deep, cause some sleep while I wake
In a dream that's made of wine but let me bring it back to grapes
Teacher, explain the parable, it's simple:
It's easier for the camel to go through the eye of a needle
Than for you to enter the kingdom, or battle
And walk away, with the title when I get, brutal
Feelings are mutual so sign your life, to Prudential
Don't even flinch, the other becomin spiritual
There's six million ways to die but choose four
Cause I can still be in the desert buttnaked and be HARDCORE!

[Lauryn Hill]
When ? checks that means pump your fist
Remember Moses people, this is Exodus
Don't try to stop this, the force comes from Genesis
Them who did us wrong, ask the Lord for forgiveness
The man got a drum, made the land of the dumb
We droppin the bass drum, then we ??
You can't kill the battle with a ?? .. feeling Joshua
So march to St. Lawrence
Yo march I got your back, march!

Now, speak of resistance, we're nappy heads
Rhymes, kinks, braids and dreads
The mother of creation, epitome of creativity, yeah
And keep your heads nappy
Tell me a line - make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love .. oooh

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just who I fell in love with
(in love...)
Oh this is the time, the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes, dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
(Yeah we know)
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)
Turn on the light - make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
(What an awful sight)

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your love of fights
All night!

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love
(real love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

[Verse 1 - Drag-On]
Awe shit drag done hit the big screen
With a gangsta lean still role with the squad
My convertible top is hard yours is rag
I bought X X7 he bought me a Jag
With a H speed stick with 220 on the dash
We don't know the meaning of leasing we drop cash
Ya bodega rappers we put style together
I bought a Swede bubble goose and X reptile leather
When we step up in the club its like awe shit there the brothers
Buy the whole bar and spit it on each other
Like he teach I learn
He bite I burn
We each take our turn to murder ya (Uh)
Hold the rubber grip firm
Let the peoples heads turn and count the money that we earn and burn it all (Uh)
Cause we gon get it this year make them sit in they chair
Having thinking like damn what you got there?

[Hook - dmx] + (Drag-On)
Let's get crazy (All my ladies over there)

Let's get crazy (All my ladies over there)

Let's get crazy (All my gangstas in the club)
Lets get crazy (Everybody everybody come on come on)

[Verse 2 - dmx]
Dog nigga X gon spit it
Cats is in trouble ya gon get it

Kinda sorta play with it like everyday with it
Make a nigga lay with it that's how I get down
Cop money over there hit the club skip town
I haven't got time for the Bs ya say the Bs ya gon see X
Ya niggas see X man its on
Don't give a fuck about right or wrong
Aight wait let me just simmer down now
Money cross the line aight put him down now
Things look at you running your mouth
Its things that got niggas running in your house
Same things that got me doin what I do
Its things that got me bustin at you (Ya bitch)

[Hook:]

[Verse 3 - Drag-On]
Kick rocks bitch, come up out of them clothes
We only fuckin with bitches that's 21 years and grown
Quick check the id's on these hoes
Especially that one there that keeps digging up her nose
Ice is blinging, ears is ringing
Niggas is scheming, bitches is fiending
Panties is creaming X is up in there
And the clubs is screaming like drag's in there

[Hook:]
(feat. 2Pac and Drag-On)

[Chorus:]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats goin' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats goin' shed blood for me
But my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us X2

[Dmx:]
If I'm gonna rob I'm a rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
If I'm goin' fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'm a play till I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
'Cuz honey friend fuck many, many men
Stay wit' the rats 'cuz the rats is real
Wanna fuck? Then we fuck already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like just show the real
Then I keep spot that we can go to chill
I Love life, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come round is for the hoes
Life works, I play it down for the hoes
Hit em off wit that dark brown you kno?

[Chorus: x2]

[Drag-On:]
You fucking wit' me ain't keeping your health right
'Cuz me and my dogs we keep it gelled tight
The shit I pack is heavy but the shells light
When they drop the same time you drop without a fight
Burning anything that I'm putting my name on
You might take a Drag but you can't flame On
I know y'all niggas don't know me wit' a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know where we are
Niggas spitting mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me limp at the bar
Spit fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
'Cuz y'all you don't wanna see how my simmy act
Fake hustling niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit I done laid plenty flat

[Chorus: x2]
Do you hear what I tell you, understand what you hear. Don't let nobody tell you what to hope and to fear. 2X

[Dmx:]
What you niggas want? 'Cuz I got it right here
Y'all niggas front then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On 'cuz he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all taking over ain't shit the sa
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And

[Chorus: x2]
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you, uh

You brought a lot of money
But me, I've got a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep, I try and try
But you’re undermine me, uh huh
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)

And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I’m dying to get away
I’m dying to get away

And next time we’ll talk it over
And we can start again

For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
A-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
A-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I’m dying to get away
I’m dying to get away

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Next time let’s talk about it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Or maybe start again

Shock, to think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it’s true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it’s true

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Next time we can talk about it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Or even start again
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
I couldn’t tell you what you wanted
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
You know what I’m saying?
I knew you were low man
But the truth is I was shocked

[Of] power eyes, eyes never lie
Kids, Kids never lie
You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong

You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road

Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly you must hush
No honestly you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

And so you wanted a hit
Well, this is how we do hits
You wanted the hit
But that's not what we do

You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part
Yeah, you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars
Saying what they want

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies
'Til you take us home

Yeah, you wanted it smart
But honestly I'm not smart
No, honestly we're never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time

Yeah, you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
Oh, we both know that's an awful line
But it doesn't make it wrong

You wanted it right
No out of mind and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights
Yeah, you wanted a hit
But tell me where's the point in it?
You wanted the hit
But that's not what we do

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies
'Til you take us home

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies
'Til you take us home
Tell me a line - make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love .. oooh

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just who I fell in love with
(in love...)
Oh this is the time, the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes, dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
(Yeah we know)
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)
Turn on the light - make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
(What an awful sight)

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your love of fights
All night!

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love

If it helps you fall in love
(in love)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no

We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh

I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans
Oh, we are North American scum
Oa, we're from North America

And all the kids, all the kids, that want to make a scene
Here in North America
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those

So where's the love, where's the love, where's the love, where's the love
Where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man, there's no love and the kids are uptight
Uh, uh

So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry

I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said the more I do it, the better it gets
Let's rock, North America

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're from North America
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we are North American
New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh

Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Boo, boo

Now we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're are North Americans
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we love North America

Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
Where we can be in any one of million new bands
North American
Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
But don't blame the Canadians
Look out North America
I run shit here, Y'all just sit here (what?)
Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here (woo!)
I'm gonna stay here, (yeah!) earn my way here (yeah!)

Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
Let me be
Let me be
Let me be
You believe in

(Verse)
It started of dark, mostly night
Wouldn't dare let my darkness bring someone light
I gladly go through it all for the purpose of a lesson
That will hopefully turn out to be a blessing
No second guessing
Let me be an example of how strong this love is
And to never put anything above his, 'cause what if
It wasn't unconditional, then what hould we do
If he did how we do
We know we wouldn't suppose to do the things
That we did but we did 'em
And if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em
But you saw it all, So we only lie to ourselves
Help us, save us from hell
Let me be!
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be, let me be, let me see!)
You believe in

(Verse)
I ask a lot of questions, 'cause I need a lot of answers
Sometimes I think I need to ask the questions faster
Surrounded by confusion, am I winning or losing?
Is it because the lifestyle that I'm choosing?
Ups and downs, Right from wrongs
Goods from bads, robbed by the ghetto of all the good I had
Still I grab, opportunity and ran with it
And a brother still can't get it, man quit it
Our lives have already been written
Destiny is not an accident
Don't mess with the fruit thats forbidden
We know God loves us, but don't test faith
Because woulda coulda shoulda are all too late

Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in

So many nights I felt alone
Without a friend I want to call on
Unlike the rain would never end
Untill you came and found a friend
And through my ups and my downs
I have someone to stick around
Your the reason I keep believing!
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...
You believe in

I wanna be, I wanna be ur angel...
Aaaa

I don't hold you responsible
On the time, i'm alone
I don't think it's unreasonable
So I won't claim all night long

Aaaa

The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up

Aaaa

Huruhuhu
Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before again
The rollin' comes again and we go and on and on...

Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

Ooh, it is what it is
Ooh, whoa
Whoa
Something in you
Brought out something in me
That I've never been since
The part of me that was only for you
That kind of romance

Comes only once
That kind of love
That kind of fever dance
That you love because
You've become someone else
In an instant

CHORUS:
Say you will
Say you will
Give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can, get you to dance
Something in you
Put a hold on my heart
It's hard to believe now
Here is a place that will never be dark
I remember that place

That kind of touch, electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone
Else
In an instant

(REPEAT CHORUS x6)
(children singing)
I am
I am
I am, I am
I am
I am
I am

Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down

Mother, father, father
Sister, lover, it is what it is
Oh

Ooh, my sister
Ooh, my father
Ooh, my lover
Ooh, it is what it is

[Verse 1]
I was an unmarried girl, I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters for the way men looked at me
Branded as a jezebel, I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame into the Magdalene Laundries

[Verse 2]
Most girls come here pregnant, some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly by her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow, all of us woe-begotten daughters
In the streaming stains of the Magdalene Laundries

[Bridge]
Prostitutes and destitutes and temptresses like me
Fallen women sentenced into dreamless drudgery
Why do they call this heartless place Our Lady of Charity?
Oh charity

[Verse 3]
These bloodless brides of Jesus, if they just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know and they'd drop the stones concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon, they leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain at the Magdalene Laundries

[Verse 5]
Peg O'Connell died today
She was a cheeky girl, a flirt, they just stuffed her in a hole
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring
One day I'm going to die here too and they'll plant me in the dirt
Like some lame bulb that never blooms come any spring

[Outro]
Not any spring
No, not any spring
Not any spring

[Christina Vidal] (chorus)
When we get down with the black suits, baby

[Will Smith]
I am the man in black

Yo, I'm dangerous

When the strange of us try to endanger us
Praise me me ya'll
Don't nothin' phase me ya'll
When they see me they gaze be all crazy , ya'll

Out of the depths of your imagination so here's Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades
The black shoes, black tie with the black attitude
New style black ray-bans, I'm stunnin' man
New hot in this pitch black 600 man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again
Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again
Tanglin' with the alien scum again
Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in

[Chorus]

Just let it loose up in here; go crazy (let me see you nod ya head)

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures

I run in the night
You see us together
Chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures

I run in the night
You see us together
Chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

Pa sent me money now
I'm gonna make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo mic check, mic check, yeah here you go
Nah, he over here
Yeah, I heard he got that hot new thing
It's called "Switch" (switch)
Let's get it going

(chorus)
Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around now, switch
Turn it over and hit it

Hey, vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Hey, something sexy 'bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nuttin'
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or sumthin'
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now switch
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now
Switch, turn it over and hit it,(X2)

(chorus (2x))ooh la la la
Uh uh uh
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like, "Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody"
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on

Switch
Now switch
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now
Switch, turn it over and hit it,(X2)
(chorus (2x))ooh la la la
Hey, hey

Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh
What you too cute to dance, or you scared

It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right hear waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo

Hey, hey

That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, switch
Heyheyhey

(chorus till end)

[Chorus]
You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don't play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a lil bitty motherfucking man
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands yo

[Verse 1]
I'm a boss, fuck that bitch out on the balcony
I might take a picture and tell 'em to caption this
When I'm done fingering, I need a napkin and shit
Ocho Cinco, yes sir I'm catching it
Catch it, catch catch it, catch it catch it catch it
I'll take your necklace, I'll leave you neckless
I might not be cussin' but I ain't bluffin'
Niggas want problems, it's not nothing
I'm screaming bring it on like Gabrielle
I'm a real big dog, I don't kiss and tell, hell
First you want it, then second, you pale, yeah
Don't think he quick, he pulled up like a snail, oh
Water in his eyes, I let that sucker go
And I forgot to tell her that you were po
I'm not doing a twenty year sentence about you, you a ho

[Chorus]
But do you dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'
Keep it funky like an egg and you will never land
All my niggas they don't play, they all want it bad
My son a boss, he a lil bitty motherfucking man

Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands, yo

[Verse 2]
Yes sir, baby, yes sir
Take her nigga, flex her

And I got on Chucks but Young Thugger not stuck
Swear, swear, swear, I swear on slime nigga
You break a rule on him or her, you get fined, nigga
These niggas know I run it up so they don’t try, nigga
I might screw you bitch with my broke pliers, nigga
Hell, yeah, all my cars they go fish tail
Hell, yeah, I'm YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Kickin you niggas, getting money slow just like a snail
I told her the mail is how they send them bales
I can never be him, but you can wish me well
I came a long way from shopping at clearance sales
She let me cum in her hair just like some gel
I'm a real Blood, I know you smell

[Chorus]
You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
Wanted money, I couldn't enjoy a class
I'm a big old player, I got it from my dad, hey
Lil' mama dig what I'm sayin'

Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I'm not lazy, I want fucking bands yo

[Intro: Ghosty]
East End in this bitch, yo
It's Ghost, Villain, Mac, Vinny, yeah
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Feelin' like a scholar, gotta keep my grades up (Uh-huh)
Hear the same stuff every day from these lame fucks (Yep)
This whole game rough, kick you while you down
And none of these motherfuckers gon' miss you when you out
I used to sit around the house, waitin' for some dollars
Now I'm out grindin', chasin' after dollars (Uh-huh)
I ain't a star just wastin' all my dollars (Haha)
We here for life, y'all fade away tomorrow
Pause, roll the dice like a board game (Board game)
I'm sleepin' with your girl and I don't even know the whore's name
So magnificent, quick to spit to kill this shit
These bitches is illiterate and this is some deliverance
No Bubba Sparks, talkin' Karl Malone
Snakebite, I hinge my jaw and swallow you whole
On my own path, throwback, dope rap (What?)
The room stops when me, Vinny, Vil or Ghost rap (Uh-huh)
Y'all fragile, broke glass, comin' with no swag
I be countin' numbers, no math, failin' class
But I'm scholarly, rap properly
Knowledge speaks with the verbal trigonometry
Uh, real slick like I'm climbin' out the foxes hole
Keep your grades up, bitch, no honor roll (What?)

[Verse 2: 

[?]]

[?] for profit
Skeletons be tryin' on the clothes in my closet (Yeah)
Infrequently home, 

[?] the coffin
In a world full of deadbeats wonderin' where the stars shit (Uh-huh)
Just pumpin' 808s, mob shit
We keep it heartless regardless of circumstance

[?] burnin' plants to stimulate my daydreams
Learn advance techniques of the speech
The way I say things, amazin'
Raisin' hell 

[?]
Infiltrate arenas with the 

[?]
Battle scars 

[?]
With O.J. gloves and 

[?] punches
I walk through the realness like niggas on crunches
Yo, fuck this, my hips are strong enough to let me hop on, I run shit
Flick of the switch, permis' to drop bombs, I'm dumb sick

[?] for fun and the shot'll make your chest burn
With sippin' that red rum, yep
So go to 

[?] on a hangover holiday (Uh-huh)
I'm dead serious, it's takin' up my closet space to hide the bones
But as time goes, they rot away
A consequence of price, you gotta pay
Even cheapskates pay the sweepstakes
I'm on the other side of the state with cheese stake and three plates of cheese cake
I'm eatin' great (Uh-huh), side-steppin' the insanity
Just make reality from fantasies with my family

[Verse 3: 

[?]]
Wordsmith, noble scribe or ghostwriter verbalist (Uh-huh)
Two .45s, Q45 swervin' it
Emerge from shit, yeah, the stench from them urban bricks
Projects, 220, I blew money for shirts and kicks
I do what I feel, I move by the real
Rude, get your food chewed, leavin' dudes out of meals (Uh-huh)

[?] Countin' reasons why I'd do it again
Like the Earth with the fire, thin as blue with the wind
Blowin' with the wind, ink artillery, I'm prone 'til the end
I get checks like a phone and a pen
More real than a estate when you owe me a 

[?]
And I'm like Jesse Owens, catch me flowin' 

[?]
On a track, venom attack for playin' with this government
College Michael Vick, QB option, we be runnin' shit
Or Terrelle Pryor, keep that fire by the underpits (Underpits)
'Cause it feels like the gun consists of a ton of bricks
Punchin' shit, punishment, no pun intended
Ever since 

[?] jump, my funds ascended
The judge my nigga, I ain't wit it', gettin' reprimanded
Ended up wipin' out my sentence like I'm left-handed
On bandwagon is the best transit

[?] (What up?)
Granted, I be thinkin' it's all fakery

[?] My vision concrete as masonry

[Verse 4: 

[?]]
Uh, look, ya
I'ma go for mine, you can never over-grind

[?] spark the light, frozen wine make the narcs get 

[?]
They wanna follow the cashflow
I tell 'em even though it comin' quick, my dough comin' legit
Cook 'em right in front of you

[?] We don't even show guns, we just spit
Seventy rounds unloaded from the 

[?]
Who made the decision to go and fuck with him? (Hmm)
I don't know what thoughts crossed they head
Uh, but niggas must be off they meds
Real rap, so that noise 

[?]
Before me and men rush in, too late for the discussions
Check it, Vinny be bangin' bitches like percussions
Felt by most, but no, ain't a nigga that can touch 'em
And I fought frequently, lookin' for my next wifey
And US Weekly, why would they unleash me?
I don't know, but yo, tell help to come quickly
'Bout to leave my mark on the game like a buck fifty
Let me say this: only players that can fuck with me
Play for the same team, which is my city, Pittsburgh
I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was flying
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain't even 20 baby
I ain't learned to love you right, yeah
Umm, good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to make you mine
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed, oh

For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay mine?
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I said forever my lady and kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I'd just play basketball or something in the park
And I messed up like boys tend to do
It'd be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I'd never be the man that I am today

For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
(Oh, you know I'm gonna be yours)
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
(I wanna be, I wanna be yours)
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
(For you I'm gonna be strong)
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay mine?

Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn't even old enough to drive
I saw my only chance just to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy's car
Cause no one's gonna ever love you better
Better than I do, yes I do
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
For the rest of my life, for the rest of my life
Come on baby, will you stay forever?
I'm gon' love you baby
For the rest of my life for you I'm gonna be strong
Gon' love you baby, gon' love you right
For the rest of my life
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay?
Baby will you stay mine?

[Intro: The Game, Robin Thicke]
This here is dedicated to all the mamas
All the beautiful women, no matter what color
My mama Marie, Robin's mom Gloria (We see you shinin')
Yeah, we see you shinin' (We see you shinin')
You all diamonds (We see you shinin')
And we love you, yeah, yeah (Like a diamond)

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
Like a butterfly, you made your way out of the shell
Ooh, like an angel, you finally got your wings
And all of the promises you made yourself are finally taking shape
You can only hold something so beautiful down so long
'Til it finds the light of day, oh yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha)
Shining so bright (Keyshia) for you to see (Paula)
Pressure (Beyoncé) builds diamonds (Mary)
Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah)
Pressure (Rihanna) builds diamonds (Latifah)
Shinin' (Michelle Obama) so bright

[Verse 2: The Game]
Uh, picture a cold winter
Me, you, middle of Manhattan, dinner
Philippe Chow's or Mister
It's the Robin Hood and the plot gets thicker
I know you think I'm talkin' 'bout my girl
My mama, my unborn daughter, my world
But daddy used to beat you harder than the five boroughs
He left you in the ocean and you came back a pearl
He put you through hell, I put you in diamonds
Forget about that nigga, we don't need him, mama
I know your only son was drama
You wanted Obama but he was Osama
On the block in his suicide bomber
Then I got shot and went to jail, comma
If that ain't karma
Me and my girl lost a baby in the womb and it chinked my armor

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha)
Shining so bright (Keyshia) for you to see (Paula)
Pressure (Beyoncé) builds diamonds (Mary)
Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah)
Pressure (Rihanna) builds diamonds (Latifah)
Shinin' (Michelle Obama) so bright

[Bridge: Robin Thicke, The Game]
All the ladies in the back (I see you shinin')
All the girls in the front (I see you shinin')
Everybody with your diamonds (I see you shinin')
Yeah, keep on shinin'; yeah, keep on (Like a diamond)
All the women across the world (I see you shinin')
Especially my girl (Keep shinin')
Just like the ocean makes the pearl
Pressure builds diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, pressure builds diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds)
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds)
You can only hold something so beautiful down so long
'Til it finds the light of day

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha)
Shining so bright (Keyshia) for you to see (Paula)
Pressure (Beyoncé) builds diamonds (Mary)
Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah)

[Outro: Robin Thicke, The Game]
Pressure (Rihanna) builds diamonds (Aretha)

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Magic, baby, baby, baby, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Magic, we, oh, we, we, we, we, we
(Robin Thicke)
We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion

But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

(Lil Wayne)
Yeah, Some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soulja
From the academy, league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, i prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothin but movin on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn
(Robin Thicke)
I work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
Who was gon fight alone
No one's gon save us now
How you feel, you're not alone
We're all just jealous jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome no
Chorus (Robin Thicke)
You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be

(Lil Wayne)
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And ima tell you whats life
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if i light one, i walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floatin
And they wonder why black people still voting, cause your presidents still chokin
Take away the football team, the basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beatin heart, and a wish and a prayer
Lets pray
(Robin Thicke)
These friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
But there's no where to go
But there's future future
Don't make this seem so low
And we can't overcome

Chorus

(Lil Wayne)
And if you come from under that water then theres fresh air
Just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, i know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that feels the best
Cause i came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they can't steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud theres a silver lining
I know...

Yeah, yeah... yeah
See... Right now we just riding on love
And shine in the dark, we ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all now
Chorus:
You tie my hands, what am i gonna be
What have i done so bad, what is my destiny
You tie my hands, what am I going to see
What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be

Born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul
And I must be me
We got spirit y'all
We go spirit
We got soul y'all
We got soul
They don't want us to see, But we already know

Jvmx

Ten car caravan, Astons Martins and all them hood whips

Pops taught me how to get low when the flow clap
Went from a boy to a king, any block I five-five-fo' that
Nigga better know that, boy they ain't playin
Sawed off shotty - what they sayin?
Nothin to a boss, I put two hoes in that LeComp
I come through fuckin niggas off, hop in that truck and then get lost
Boy you playin with a King, not Gretzky, hit it if you let me
Keep yo' girl wetter than Game on a jet-ski
Ooh cool cool - say he smoother than a baby's ass

Look on that Mercedes dash, boy you know what it is
Blowin on a scarecrow, on my way to see the Wiz!

[Chorus]

Don't gotta understand, they know

Concentrated, everyday I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I'm high as a muthafucker
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No sticks, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled

I'm blowin' every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that
Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
'Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubber bands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it

(No sticks, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm blowin' every gram I own

[Intro: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
(The night is so young)
The night is so young
(The stars are so bright)
The stars are so bright
Love the way that I'm feeling
¿Que vas hacer?

[Chorus: Shakira]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong

[Verse 1: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Can I buy you a drink?
Hey, what you think?
I'm Superman, be my Lois Lane
I don't care if you're the only single man on Earth
Don't be sure you're getting lucky tonight
Don't be

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Patience ain't a friend of mine
You ain't the only one in line
If you wash it boy, let it dry, let it dry
I got the recipe
Gotta cook it slowly
See, I'm your remedy
If you want to succeed
Just let the girl take the lead
Dammit, just for once in your life

[Post-Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
(The night is so young)
The night is so young
(The stars are so bright)
The stars are so bright
Love the way that I'm feeling
Dance, I said

[Verse 2: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Can I buy you a drink?
Still ain't changed your mind?
I got a plan to make you mine
If you rush it, I don't like it
Don't you understand?
All the good things
Need that effort and take some time

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Patience ain't a friend of mine
You ain't the only one in line
If you wash it boy, let it dry, let it dry
I got the recipe
Gotta cook it slowly
See, I'm your remedy
If you want to succeed
Just let the girl take the lead
Dammit, just for once in your life

[Post-Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
(The night is so young)
The night is so young
(The stars are so bright)
The stars are so bright
Love the way that I'm feeling

[Bridge: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
X-ray, I can see your insides
Turn around girl, lemme see your backside
Stop, I'm tryna be good, I'm tryna be good
O.K. you good, I'ma be the bad man
Steal your heart in the middle of the night and
When max man hits in the
Shaki grab the mic and hips to the max man

[Chorus: Shakira]
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong
Gotta work on my seduction if you wanna get it on
But if you think that I'm an easy catch, you're dead wrong

[Outro: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh, this is the place I'll die

Prime 112 behind the double doors
As I rewind the devils floors
Paths cross, of course your life lost
"Patience a virtue. Heard that you're the boss"
Your informant's correct
Now give me enormous respect
Cornered the game, record label on his chain
Right hand on the bible watch the flow catch flame
Margielas on her feet
Now she riding with a lame all jealous in the Jeep
All the lil homies wanna eat
But we never settle beef
So settle your debts before there's any regrets
Gino do the graffitti and Black Evander with the Tech
My girls say that I'm a mess
DJ Khaled say I'm the best
And my city do too
20 in the trunk, that's how city boys move
8.9, now the crib got a view
Mandarin manicure, DEA in pursuit
Champagne and a Rolex, Rose
No church for a d-boy: let's pray

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Ain't no church in the wild for a nigga like me
In the game so foul in a world full of sin
Where the love flow thin
And the pain run deep
Cause it's blood in the streets
See the stains on the money, No love for the weak
Where it rain, never sunny, just mud on a beach
Where a hater sticks to you like mud on a cleat
Thanksgiving with the birds just drugs for a feast
Young'n only 13 with a snub in his fleece
Even though his heart's cold, he in love with the heat
See the high in his eyes, hear the slugs in his speech
From the bottom out of Philly, I emerge from the east
Peace! At the dealer talking Bugatti talk
You never heard it like Illuminati talk
Tell em haters that it's my mama's fault
Breaking bricks - you would think we talking karate talk
Young niggas with old money
Never trust a nigga that said "let me hold something"
Never trust a bitch that tell you she ain't blown nothing
The Weathermen never tell me about these cold summers
Tears dripped on my dad casket
Niggas turned me into a bastard
Glock 40 on me is plastic
Get to reaching I'm squeezing on him and clapping
And I ain't talking about assemblies
I'm talking head-shots where niggas won't remember me
I asked God please remove my enemies
I was surprised when I lost niggas that was friends of me
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, alright
Every day, every night
I see you walking down with that other guy
I see your face, you're not satisfied
I know you wanna, you wanna hide

I feel like, I feel like, I feel like
Do you know it, know that, know that
Come on baby, you give me the come on
I love you, baby, come on and let's make it right

Ooh, you're so good looking and baby
You're so smooth
I know you have
Come on baby, wish me luck
I wanna be there, in that truck

Come on and give me that feeling
Come on give it, oh, that feeling
Oh, I want you rockin' on, right by my side
Come on, come on, and take my side
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on and get me, get me
I wanna take you with me
But don't you let me, let me, oh come on
Let me give you a good time
Ohh yeah, give you a good time
Like we've never had
Promises never be free
I've heard them all
Every day and night you know I'm OK
Funny things happen, I don't know what you're talking about
Make you, you make me
I'm gonna wish that I had
Just you, just you, I want you, I love you
It's been so hard
Take it into your eyes
Feel like

Give me the pieces, pieces of your heart
I love you, I love you, love you, love you, love you
And make a big start
Brand new start
Let's make a brand new start

Ooh, let's make a brand new start
I'm giving you that broken heart
Oh, I need you baby
Come on and baby, tell me what you feel
You can have me, we'll make a deal
Broken pieces left on the side
Oh, come on don't hide
I love you, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
That's 'cause I love you
I love you, I love you
Oh, come on and take me
'Cause I need your
I need your loving
Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you're watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on
You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara smile
Oh, won't you smile a while for me? Sara

If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
And if you want be be free
You know, all you got to do is say so

When you feel cold, I'll warm you baby
And when you feel you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
And it's you and me forever
Sara smile
Why don't you smile a while for me? Sara
Sara smile
Why don't you smile a while for me? Sara, Sara
Hey, excuse me, I forgot my name
It's okay, we're all the same
I will love you if you like my name
But we are all the same
Excuse me, I forgot my name
It's okay, we're all the same
I will love you if you like my name
But we are all the same
Excuse me, I forgot my name
It's okay, we're all the same
I will love you if you like my name
But we are all the same
Excuse me, I forgot my name
It's okay, we're all the same
I will love you if you like my name
But we are all the same
Excuse me, I forgot my name
Excuse me, I forgot my name

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer
(summer)
When I met you in the summer
(summer)

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
(summer)
When I met you in the summer
(summer)
(summer)
When I met you in the summer
Deena (The Dreams)
We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
But we've got to grow
We've got to try
Though it's hard so hard
We've got to say goodbye
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(It's so hard, baby it's so hard)
Hard...

[Chorus]
So much cash that a nigga can't hold it
I walk around with bands on me nigga I'm loaded
Nigga I'm loaded, fuck nigga I'm loaded
All this money on me I can't tote it
I think I need help cause a young nigga loaded
Nigga I'm loaded, fuck nigga I'm loaded

My pockets got them ? like professor klump
I'm in a rarrari so the front yea thats what a trunk
I'm smoking thousand dollar blunts it smell like a skunk
I got pine a purple drink I'm a strike the punch
I took the bitch for breakfast but I gave a ? for lunch
I got three hundred thousand dollars eat my captain crunch
I get these bitches what they want I get like a flaunt
She just wanna address some ? wanna smoke a shunt
Oh thats yo girl? man don't get your panties in a bunch
You know she gobble on ma balls like they crunchy munch
I ball four quarter straight I don't ever punt
I'm in the club everyday, you just want so much

[Chorus]
Nasty, white girl
Stacks in my house, don't need a bank account
So much mula, a bitch can't even count
Grab a stack don't hesitate to spend it all
Went to Lennox fuck duck the whole malls
Stacks in my attic, stacks in my carpet
Stacks in my mattress, bitch look at my apartment
Yea you see that paper coming out apartments
White brick mob, look wah we just started
Leave ours haters stanking like that muhfucker farted
Yo bitch just mad cause my shoes she can't afford it
Tweet another bitch yes ho I imported
Bring the mural checks cause bitch I'm important!

[Chorus]
King of my city, you know I am the baydestrian
All this polo on you know I am any question
My super model bitch bad, if she is a lesbian
She let a white girl mob, she can join cause she mexican
I am not a actor don't play me like a desbian
My porno bitch a factor she just wanna a adian
Shout out to trey, I'm living like a maybian
I bought the bar out, they at the door saying let me in
I rock a lot Gucci Gucci, prada and fendi
My white bitch playing Gucci snowing pot outta of Benji
Stacks on deck like a nigga in a batter box
Nigga I'm loaded is that what you mad about?

[Chorus]

[Writer(s): Antonio Carlos Jobim]

Sad is to live in solitude
Far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
That never can be, will never be
Dreamer awake, wake up and see

Your beauty is an aeroplane
So high my heart can't bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain
Sad is to live in solitude

Your beauty is an aeroplane
So high my heart can't bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain
Sad is to live in solitude
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
It's freedom, I said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
Time to get free, or give your selves up now
It's freedom, said it's free time yo
There's a war in the mind over territory, for the dominium
Who will dominate the opinions?
Schisms and isms, keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision to the world church of decision
Trapped in a section, submitted to committing election
Moral affection, epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection, of the highest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders from hearin' it like underwater
Beyond the borders, find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy of a systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity, head first in the cavity without a bottom
A fate, worst then Sodom
What's gotem drunk of the spirit?
Truth comes we can't hear it when you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was falling in indecision
Appalling, calling religious a program on television
How can... Dominate wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of antichrists'? The majority rules
Intelligent fools
P. H. D. 's in illusion, masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of past illusion
Now who you choosing?
The head or the tail?
The bloodshed of the male or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale discussing doctrines of Baal
Causing peoples to fail keeping a third in jail
His words nailed everything to the tree
Severing all of me from all that I use to be
Formless and void, totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness's, Lord keeping me from the sword
Can I steal a little love?
Can I steal a little love?
Coo me, honey, I'm on fire
To steal your love is my desire

Hug me, squeeze me, till I'm red
Till my eyes bug out my head
Coo me, woo me, turtle dove
Can I steal a little love?

Please tell me, why are you driving me crazy
Why do I dig you like I do?
If I should steal a little kiss and you can prove that it's wrong
I'll give it back to you

Tell me, honey, with a smile
I can walk you down the isle
I won't even need a shove
Can I steal a little love?

Can I steal a little love?
Can I steal a little love?
Coo me, honey, I'm on fire
To steal your love is my desire
Hug me, squeeze me, till I'm red
Till my eyes bug out my head
Coo me, woo me, turtle dove
Can I grab a little love?

Please tell me, why are you driving me crazy
And why do I dig you like I do?
If I should steal a little kiss and you can prove that it was wrong
Hey, I'll give it back to you

Tell me, honey, with a smile
I can walk you down the isle
I won't even need a shove
Can I steal a little love?
Can I steal a little love?
Can I grab a little love?

When I met you in the summer

You act so innocent now

We fell in love
When I met you in the summer

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]The minute I wake up I gotta get high
The homies we found us a way to get by
Lets call us some bitches and have a good time
A lot of bottles of Vodka as we forget time
Lets clean up the Chevy so we can ride by
Quick piece of pussy call it a drive by
I'ma slide by sippin on that high life
And my slippers jack triple where my five light
As a all-star I made so many highlights
Touchdown field goal this my night
She the wild type ready for the wild night
Are you the buy type, hangin at the bar type
I hope you are 'cause that mean a player all right
Smokin like a Taylor so the paper is all white
Tryna to land a plane baby are you really gain
Back to the future me and Wiz got this thing sayin'

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]I stay high while ya'll stay low
Tryna tell me 'bout the smell I know
But I stay red form all that smoke
The weeds with me everywhere I go
And ya'll can roll, woah woah woah woah woah woah woah oh oh oh
And ya'll can roll, woah woah woah woah woah woah woah oh oh oh
And ya'll can roll

[Rick Ross - Verse 2]I got yo girl diggin all in my ash tray
Dickin her down for the few past days
She asked the name of my sneakers, are they designer?
Shawty green as the reefer even the grinder
Fuckin like it's a porn in my recliner
Lookin straight in the eyes, they show vagina
She's a lair but damn she does it well
We on fire imagine what it'll sell
All my homies are people that I admire
Small click of real niggas smokin that fire
Holdin' my dick until the day that I expire
We and Wiz in the benz gettin' higher

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]

[Rick Ross - Verse 3]I'm in the right pair of Nike Airs
From gravel to marble I travel light years
I'm like chyea I'ma chill right chea
Like the Mack 11 on me nigga no fear
Skateboard aboard to Panamerica
I make more abroad than in America
Waitin' for the day Bob rose from the dead
In hd as I take an ounce to the head

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
It’s the champagne pourin’
Big joint rollin’
Bombay sippin’
No blunt smoking
Bad bitch gettin’
Thick and she got some friends with her
I take ‘em out pourin’ shots of liquor
Drinkin’ out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
Nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don’t rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That’s the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I’m passing through
Rollin’ doobies up, ya hoe who we pass ‘em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
Thats what I have to do

[Chorus]
See after drinking champagne all night
Never worry `bout a damn thing, y’all might
Homie I’m on my level (yeh)
I’m on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeh)
I’m on my level (yeaah)
So let me take one shot to the brain
And I order three more shots
I’m going in, ayy
I’m on my level (yeh)
I’m on my level (yeah)
I’m on my level (yeh)
I’m on my level (yeaah)

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
Spent a couple dollars on my engine
Motor roaring when I back out the garage
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar
Plus I’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard, roll the camera
Life just like a movie, I’m the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin’ Rose with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin’
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas
So when I say I’m balling, that don’t mean that I’m playing mate
All my diamonds talkin’, you can see what they sayin’ mayne

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin’
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin’
I’m wide awake, we ain't eatin’, we ain't sleepin’
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin’
We just freakin’
You rollin’ with short dog baby
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady
Come to my house I give ‘em everything they want
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Man I’m high as fuck
Man I swear I’m on my level
Man I’m sloppy drunk
Man I swear Im on my level
I finna pass out
Man I swear Im on my level
A nigga get smashed out
Man I swear I’m on my level

Man I’m high as fuck
Man I swear I’m on my level
Man I’m sloppy drunk
Man I swear Im on my level
I finna pass out
Man I swear Im on my level
A nigga get smashed out
Man I swear I’m on my level

Watch me get this money nigga, tired of being hungry nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch
I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' Ollie switch
Buncha novices, odd future the squad, its thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, twerk as I get on the verse, cursin'
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin'
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather
Sitting on tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists, it's cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy posers looking silly boy
I'm in that past season 'preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (diddy riese)
Na'kel smith transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens
See y'all niggas trippin' man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd, that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the Tron Cat fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Over and over, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch
Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)
I'm seeing it's a drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Bitch gotta (Oh, shut the fuck up!)

[Intro sample]
Heavenly Father, creator of all things
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne
Heavenly Father

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son needs
I try and live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder, will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, 'cause I'd take over
I feel it approachin' but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace
(Heavenly Father)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, and everytime I see the sun shine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the frontline
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right
So when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest (Heavenly Father)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take (Heavenly Father)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bury me a gangster 'cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breathe of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that owner
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so I just gotta make my way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock
(Heavenly Father) Belee that

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake (Heavenly Father)

[Outro: sample]
Creator of all things
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne
Heavenly Father

What should I call this happy madness that I feel inside of me
Sometime of wild October gladness that I never thought I'd see
What has become of all my sadness all my endless lonely sighs
Where are my sorrows now
What happened to the frown and is that self contented clown
Standing grinning in the mirror really me
I'd like to run through Central Park carve your initials in the bark
Of every tree I pass for every one to see
I feel that I've gone back to childhood and I'm skipping through the wildwood
So excited that I don't know what to do
What do I care if I'm a juvenile I smile my secret little smile
Because I know the change in me is you
What should I call this happy madness all this unexpected joy
That turned the world into a baby's bouncing toy
The god's are laughing far above one of them gave a little shove
And I fell gaily gladly madly into love
We'll gather lilacs in the spring again
And walk together down an English lane
Until our hearts have learned to sing again
When you come home once more

And in the evening by the firelight's glow
You'll hold me close and never let me go
Your eyes will tell me all I want to know
When you come home once more

And in the evening by the firelight's glow
You'll hold me close and never let me go
Your eyes will tell me all I want to know
When you come home once more
Shout out the blue flag
Shout out the red flag
Shout out the black flag
Fuck the white flag

[Verse 1: 2-D]
The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
Keeping my groove on

[Chorus: Noodle & 2-D]
Here you go!
Get the cool (Get the cool)
Get the cool shoeshine (Get the cool shoeshine)

Get the cool (Get the cool)
Get the cool shoeshine (Get the cool shoeshine)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between its brain and its tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose
Keeping my groove on

[Chorus: Noodle & 2-D]
Here you go!
Get the cool (Get the cool)
Get the cool shoeshine (Get the cool shoeshine)

The night that I looked at you

And here we are, here we are, here we are I'm in Heaven
For you are mine, you are mine at last, at last

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Forty
Am I rappin' or what?
I can't hear the headphones, yeah
Turn me up in the headphones
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, alright

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Jump tumble
Front flips off the roof like a stunt double
My shorty doin' kegels for her cunt muscle
Keep her shaped up
The M3 all green fly like a strange duck
My dad was right when he said I was a deranged fuck
Now every meal is calamari and boudin blanc
Saddam Hussein guns
Held by nuns who do drugs
While beige hard bottoms slide on the new rug
Pinky up
The joint thicker than Pinky's butt
Just as stinky
Nick Van Exel with the handle, Helsinki
Eggs Rothko
The handmade suit cloth hang out the sports coat
Twenty three and a half feet on the sports boat
Brown vest made of suede on my torso
Close my eyes, inhale deep, sail free
Blind fury, hoppin' out the braille jeep
Serve me snails to eat
No ham and cheese, I'm tannin'
The 540i, color salmon
Smoke a cannon
Push the seat back
Put your feet up
Roll my weed up (It's me)

[Chorus: Action Bronson]
Why's it feel like my life is movin' fast, yo? (I don't know)
Get your own, don't worry about my cash flow (Bitch)
Need a chick to hide the hammer in her asshole
I need that first class dough (You understand me?)
Yeah, why's it feel like my life is movin' fast, yo? (I don't know)
Get your own, don't worry about my cash flow (That's right)
I need a chick to hide the hammer in her asshole
I need that first class dough

[Verse 2: Big Body Bes]
It's me, Big Body
Who the fuck else?
You gotta pardon my absence, man
I just came back off of vacay, man
Just spent the whole fuckin' weekend up in Orchard Beach
Livin' the fuckin' life
I was out there wildin'
Had your moms on the motherfuckin' boogie board
Doin' all types of stunts
But now I'm back though, ain't shit changed
Just came back, check my motherfuckin' emails
Got more motherfuckin' deals on the table
Don't even know what the fuck to do now
Shit
Oh my God
But you can still see me though
Out there on Fulton Street, three in the mornin'
Bench pressin' a fiend
Ain't shit changed, still loitering
Ace Hood, Game what up ni**a?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]Thank god momma son made it
At twenty three
Still remembering a struggle
Hidden deep in me
Momma gone, ain't no single
Daddy memory
I became my own man the age
Of seventeen
Trying make this money flip like
It's a trampoline
I was hard headed, grandfather
Diabetic
I was trying do it big, like I was
Faith Evans
Praying to the heavens, I can see

[Chorus]
I always wanted to stunt so hard (Yeah,) I always wanted to ride that whip (Always)
I always wanted to fuck that bitch (I always,) thank you, God, I fucked that bitch (God)
I always wanted to live this life (Life,) I always wanted to wear that ice (All this ice)
I always wanted paradise, I always wanted paradise, look

[Post-Chorus]
Now it don't take a lot to make you rich (To make you rich)
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit (I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit)
But I feel like money is the best drug (Best drug)
Sometimes hate can be the best love

[Verse]
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me, niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie, got a pretty young girl, look like Janet on me (Word)
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers ‘til we crash up the whole database (Word)
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base (Yeah,) closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes (Yeah)
What you think this life just landed on me? My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes (Yeah,) every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances, back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic, even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie, I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie, making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed, so fuck is my ransom, homie?

[Verse 1]
I wonder if I took these scars
And poured dirt in 'em
Would I grow me a brand new heart
Would love work again?
If I keep letting you hurt me
I might have to plead insanity
'Cause everything in me is telling me to go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't keep on crying when I see ya
Messing up my make up
Thinking you gon' change but everything's the same
Started keeping secrets
Got my heart in pieces
I'm about to pick myself up, yup

[Chorus]
You gon' wake up in the morn (Yup)
And find out that I'm already gone
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
You gon' wake up in the morn (Yup)
And find out that I'm already gone
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase

[Verse 2]
Boy, you had everything
I never thought about another man
Gave you so much control of me
Your love really had me bugging me
If I don't let you go
You'll just keep on hurting me more and more
'Cause everything in me is telling me to go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't keep on crying when I see ya
Messing up my make up
Thinking you gon' change but everything's the same
Started keeping secrets
Got my heart in pieces
I'm about to pick myself up, yup

[Chorus]
You gon' wake up in the morn (Yup)
And find out that I'm already gone
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
You gon' wake up in the morn (Yup)
And find out that I'm already gone
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase

[Bridge]
One foot out the door
You won't hurt me no more
Got my things, I'm on my way
There's no reason for me to stay
'Cause I finally see the truth
And I refuse to be used
I'm so cool on loving you
Zipping up my suitcase

[Chorus]
You gon' wake up in the morn (Yup)
And find out that I'm already gone (Already gone)
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
You gon' wake up in the morn (Yup)
And find out that I'm already gone (Already gone)
Got a one way ticket, here's your goodbye song
And while you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain
I'll be zipping up my suitcase
While you're trying to explain

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she' stay strong yeah yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating
And I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle yeah yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating
And I'm like no, not really cause'
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need the next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question
Oh I think I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
(Yeah)

If you a rat or you a snitch
You shouldn't listen to this
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh
If you ain't mention the prince
I'm sick with the spit
You pissed I get chips for this shit
This for my homies that be OT whip full of bricks
I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride
I'm ahead of my time
I'm a threat to you guys, why?

I'm still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes
Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit
Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich
I'm fresh 'cus we don't sound like that other bullshit
My team hustle, no days off
And weigh so much salt? that you might have to take a snow day off
You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you
Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to
Talk slick like the life we can't get about you
And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you
See Wiz Khalifa's like a teacher I could show you to
A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains
You claim to be S-T-A-R-S
But like your under 21 you can't fuck with my bars
Ask about me the streets think I'm the youngest in charge
Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads
And if it's on then I'm crushing them all
You niggas prolly right, when you say that I ain't fucking with' cha' 'y'all, dog
I'm on a paper chase, moving unit state to state
So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make
Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace
Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating off a paper plate
I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game
Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames
And they come with success some niggas gotta hate
I see you playin with me, it's different, it's not a game
I'm moving heavy in the trenches
Best flow, back dow (door)
When I knock any nigga senseless
I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three
Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to me

(Yeah I'm the prince)
(That's what it is man)
(Show and prove man)
(That's the name of the game man)
(Show and prove)
(And I got next)
(It's ya boy wiz khalifa, 412)

Chorus:

When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I'ma give her just that what she said
And I'ma break her down till she can't get it out of her head
She loves it when I
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
She loves it when I
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
Throw dat dick, she loves it

Verse 1:
She loves the way I put it down on her fine ass
Straight strong armed robbery black mask
The whole 9 and a half in your fat ass
I got the pussy soaking wet just that fast
Said she got it from her mama she a freak too
And she got a couple friends she could bring too
I'ma beat it up, like a bongo
And I've a feeling like she deep off in the Congo
See I'm world wide, with my dick game
Kuntakinte my nick name, ain't shit changed
You know my pedigree, she got up in it like geodesy
Chorus:
I wanna make love, when she whisper in my ear in the club
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that

Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I'ma give her just that what she said
And I'ma break her down till she can't get it out of her head
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
She loves it when I
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
Throw dat dick, she loves it

Verse 2:
She got a whole lot of ass and a lil waist
The reason bout to have me guilty on a murder case
She said I tried to kill her pussy first morning 8
I guess she looking like Rihanna, need a piece of cake
I rode a night I love it up in the strip club
So many women to choose from, I'm mixed up
Magic city on Mondays, I'm all in
High next Tuesdays, I'm balling
Wednesdays I'm headed took them all
I love the girls and I'm tryna fuck them all
I'm a stroke current d away
Sundays fall less we okay
Chorus:
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I'ma give her just that what she said
And I'ma break her down till she can't get it out of her head
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
Throw dat dick, she loves it

[AIDA]
This is the moment when
The gods expect me to beg for help
But I won't even try
I want nothing in the world
But myself to protect me
And I won't lie down, roll over, and die

All I have to do is forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic
Would have died

It's easy, it's easy

All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start
It's easy, it's easy
Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him
And how he would have been, were I to be with him today
Those very rare occasions don't let up, they keep on coming
All I've ever wanted and I'm throwing it away
It's easy, it's easy as life

But then I see the faces of a worn, defeated people
A father and a nation who won't let a coward run
Is this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages?
Forcing us to move and they're the hardest things we've done
They're easy, so easy

And though I'll think about him
'Til the earth draws in around me
And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love
This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption
Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above
It's easy, it's easy as life
It's easy as life
It's easy as life!

And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Well you came in loving me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you
Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember

[Instrumental Intro]

[Outro]
Fuck you!
Fuck your whole family and your bare legged kids
Fuck you!
Fuck your little sister and your little brother
Fuck you!
Fuck all your friends and everyone
Fuck you!
Fuck your little puppy and your puppy dog

[J] Allow me not to cause pain

[Jay-Z]
Police in the background, screamin put the thing down
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down
Si-rens ringin out, old ladies screamin out
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now
.. it's feelin like a dream now
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now
I'm lyin next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
Let me bring y'all niggas back to the very first scene now
December 4th, a child is born
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand
It's a cold cold world but I overstand
Tryin to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn
Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man - c'mon

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
.. get the best of you

[R. Kelly]
Late one night I was, rollin the streets
Just, thinkin about what's goin on with me and
Trapped in this thug life, tryin to break free but
This thug life just keeps callin me
I'm livin life way too dangerously
I'm drownin in my misery
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy
Cause poppa never was a part of me
Take one step at a time, mama said
Sweet memories still remain in my head
All of my life been lied to, misled
Voices be like, "Don't you wish you was dead?"
No ground to place my feet
I feel the fire under me
A way out is all I need
Somebody, answer me!

[Chorus + ad libs]

[Jay-Z]
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
.. cause ain't no goin home for me
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand
A true first cause I knew that man
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt
Guess he's tryin to do the same, told me get up out his turf
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
Momma's rent, his young brother's clothes
My nephew's food, and with that I suppose
.. and with that I froze
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds
And this story is told, for young soldiers
Who never choose the life we chose

[Chorus + (ad libs)]

[R. Kelly]
Tears in my eyes as I look up, I'm tryin to
Hold back my pride but reality is screamin
Gotta get a job cause mo-mma also screamin
Streets are just like drugs, and it's like I'm out here fiendin
Forget all the hits in the industry, cause
Ain't no exceptions in this game for me, look
Neither God or my enemies, I
Choose God cause he understands, this
Young man with a thuggish heart
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart
Like I'm so close, but it's still so far
Nightmares of me in a swervin car, ohhh
No ground to place my feet (my feet)
I feel the fire under me (heyyy)
A way out is all I need (all I need)
Somebody, answer me!

[Chorus + ad libs]
Black jeans, white tee
Black rims, white B
Eight figure nigga, small digits don't excite me
Iced out brightly, shine like lightning
Everything bad bout my bitches but they hygiene
Turned up hyphy, every time you see me on
Matter fact, you can't see me
'Less you turn your TV on
Ay, we beyond that peon shit
That he be on
I stunt, ball daily
Fuck y'all, pay me
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
My life like a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese
On five blazin', burnin' hot cajun
Ay dude, fuck it

Every time you see me out
Just take yo' ho' and
We be out
We throwin 'bands and goin' HAM, no doubt
You know what we be 'bout

[Chorus]
Ballin' out the frame
Stuntin' like a fool

[x4]
Ay you know how we do
Stuntin' like a fool

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you bitch smokin' grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, its gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thing
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, hi it's me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
So what?
Weed, fun, we don't care who sees
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild...

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
Your girl just kissed a girl

Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold, bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I said rackets, ratchets hold up

If you're a freak, then you coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousines
My touch is the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do

Then we have s**, next thing you know
Everything is cool
Best of Both Worlds! Holla at your boy

[Jay-Z]
Like we always do about this time
Uh-huh, yeah
I know what you doin ma
Tryin to get in an argument with me so I can
Do my mad thing, you want me to do my mad thing
I understand - c'mon!

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
Seems we're always arguing, but
Right after the arguing we have, s**
And somehow it's the best, yes
Seems we're always arguing, but
Right after the arguing we have, s**
And somehow it's the best girl

[first instance of Chorus - no last line]

[Jigga overlaps first instance of Chorus]
Gangsta love, gangsta love

[Jay-Z]
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home
S** is always better fresh off a vendetta
We break up or break you off then we right back together
Then this brand new leathers and Caroline Aurera
Marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather
Like we sick but we fine, shit we couldn't feel better
Just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever
Who got a mouth on her, woo, she put some words together
Sometimes'll make a nigga wanna leave, but when we make up

[Chorus:]

[Jay-Z over Chorus]
Woo!
Boy talk boy!

[are. Kelly]
Break up to make up baby
Seems that's all we do darlin
But no one wants to walk out the door
After all of the holla'n
Cursing and fighting
And me sleeping on the couch
In the midst of our stormy weather
S** brings the sun out
After I hit that there
Seems we don't have a care
S** makes you say I'm sorry
And things like I'm not goin nowhere
It's somethin bout the P-you-S-S-Y
That keeps brother in check, even I
Even if you was a pimp you couldn't survive
Without the H-E-L-P to provide you

[Chorus:]

[third instance of Chorus - no last line]

[Jay-Z]
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home
Remember that night? You was all like
Maybe we should go our seperate ways for life
I hit the lights fit you tight at the lil' place right
I hit it right you look me right in the eyes like psych
You was goin through your act 'til I caught you in the sack
And I made you relax when I (hit it hard from the back)
Yeah now we back friends
And the next time you need some s** counselin, we

[Chorus - new last line "after we get through arguin we"]

[are. Kelly]
Seems we're always arguing, but
Right after the arguing we have, s**
S** with best friends
From the bathroom to the kitchen (we sex)
From the kitchen to living room (we sex)
From the living room to upstairs (we sex)
Upstairs to the attic (we sex)
Attic to the basement (we sex)
From the basement to the car garage (we sex)
Garage to the back of the Jeep (we sex)
Bicycle to the treadmill (we sex)
Even over by the dirty lawnmower (we sex)
The neighbors and the dogs are lookin crazy (we sex)
I don't care because you're my baby (we sex)
It's our house, and we can have s** (we sex)
Anytime we want to (we sex)
They can kiss my ass, because whoa-ho-hoo

I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in this wide world just made for me
And now I see

I had to save my love for you
I never gave my love till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you

And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
Beat no sound, beat no sound, beat no sound, beat no sound, beat no sound, beat no sound, beat no sound

All we ever do is rock ice board gold
Ever since we was bout 12 years old
Middle of the summer and the streets still cold
Every nigga here got a story untold
(Only N Atlanta)
Gave it to the free men but they wanted love
Diddy said he blew a quarter million in the club
Every nigga here got a boxin on the hammer
Every nigga here thinkin Tony Montana
(Only N Atlanta)

(Verse)
Welcome to the city where them lil niggas die
Like everybody Gotti, even the broke niggas fly
Every night sun, and it’s sunny, we in the club
Got no problem getting this money, just need a plug
Nigga just more than this chain done in this crib
Nigga invest more in his car than where he live
Swear that bitch in the club at least a 7
Niggas do it all for the fame, be living legends
Shit cost 700, the baller know what he’s sippin
And if a bitch look like a model she probably strippin
Party with the others, so pour in the blue flame
An ex street nigga, he called my nickname
For everybody going for self, nobody’s changed
Niggas damn broke still living like millionaires
The welcoming committee, we call them the Robin crew
There’s a very good chance them niggas will rob you
(Hook)
All we ever do is rock ice board gold
Ever since we was bout 12 years old
Middle of the summer and the streets still cold
Every nigga here got a story untold

Every nigga here got a boxin on the hammer
Every nigga here thinkin Tony Montana

(Verse)
Well ye ain’t talkin that belingo
And we playin mad while rippin up the Nino
The big homie guy light up bricks and they gorgeous
You can really get yo ass in jail, go to forge it
Feed the pistol right there on the deal say Feragamo
And niggas out here trappin just to do shit for they mama
We act like some stronger, that’s how we start the flaky summer
And we ain’t got shit but middle finger for your honor
And every niggas wishin we the same, think he baller
And every nigga in the expedition got a 40
And every nigga round me, get your mind on some money shit
We walkin round, we stride like the fuckin government
Every nigga run this bitch, you’re nervous to the bullshit
On that south side, you getting yo fake crap by fuck shit
We hit our measure, tryin to get a plane of shrimp shit
RIP to Double D, king of that pimp shit
(Hook)
All we ever do is rock ice board gold

(Verse)
I was born in the town where it all goes down
Since the roll had the white hit the bluff with the brown
Man I’m proud to admit, after housing them bricks
Man I’m still a free man blowing loud in the 6
And I’m rich more than a nigga could imagine
From where you get from rappin not for trappin
Only in Atlanta can a nigga get it poppin
All from Magic City, 100 thousand in the pocket
Only in Atlanta can a nigga ride D
15 years on 15 key
Only in Atlanta homie nigga get paid
Trappin broad day with a new AK
How we ever do it? Pop bottles for a ho
Gold 24 where the chrome short nose
All we ever get is bank rolls, rubber band round that
Just a message so you can’t just recognize where you…
(Hook)
All we ever do is rock ice board gold
Ever since we was bout 12 years old
Middle of the summer and the streets still cold

Circles around competition, not an optimo
To sit low in a six oh, oh
Solo on lo-lo's, fuck po'-po's
Take a photo, last time you see a nigga so cold

[Verse 1]
I was born not breathing
Since I've woke up every day
Oh and I can't even believe it
The victims of the USA
They all keep talkin' but got nothin' to say
It had me seizing up
And so the season is up

[Chorus]
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart

[Verse 2]
I searched and drifted and grieved, man
Just trying to decide who to be
Oh and I took a seat by the sea
And I laid beneath the evergreen trees
And I decided I'd just try to be me
And I stopped seizing up
And still the season is up

[Chorus]
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart

[v1]
All the world is a stage
Every book has a page with tear stains
Every painting a frame
All the memories portrayed in beautiful ways
All the stories you told me
Never one which i could be set free
And the moral was ugly
You refused to ever tell me you loved me

[Chorus]
I lost a life
Waiting for you
To change your mind
Waiting for you
Go on take a stab at me
Take a blind stab into my heart
Do you know how we can
Re-write the story from the start

[v2]
I took apart all the morals
And i started to erase all of the chapters
I told the girl in the story
That for her happy ending we'd need to adapt her

[Chorus]
I lost a life
Waiting for you
To change your mind
Waiting for you
Go on take a stab at me
Take a blind stab into my heart
Do you know how we can
Re-write the story from the start

[m8]
All the stories
That you told me
Can i be free
All the stories
That you told me
Can i be free

[Chorus]
I lost a life
(I lost a life)
Waiting for you
(Waiting for you)
To change your mind
Waiting for you
(Waiting fo you)
Go on take a stab at me
(Waiting for you)
Take a blind stab into my heart
Do you know how we can
Re-write the story from the start
Ooooooooooooooh
Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto

Chorus
Im from the Motherf**king slums
Where the cops dont come
Turn the lights on and
The thugs dont run
You ain't shit without no gun
In the Ghetto (Ghetto) Ghetto (Ghetto)

[x2]

Sean Kingston:
Im From the Ghetto
You ain't seen the slums
Till ya seen were im from
Everydays a homicide
Niggas sleep with their gun
Fellaz running wrekcless
Its hectic
Their objectives
Holding niggas down
They ain't trying to see us exit
Im from the land of gun tookers
And weed smokers
Poverty is sickness
Plus them grew vicious
You dont want your juice
To be dripping on a late night
Buck 50 till ya feds light

[Chorus]

[x2]
Those boiz got the corner popping

Hungry niggas they corner hopping
Trying to get any way 2 fit in
Pop the trunk and it
Looks like a gun store
F**k around killers kick in
Ya front door
Stop the bloodclut crying
Ring the alarm
And the slugs start flyin
And I tell that
People keep dying
Whats the cost
Gas price to high
They ain't taking shorts

[Bridge]
In the ghetto
Badman run wild
La la show times
Leak all those grids now
In The Ghetto
Them no response
Born a battyman
People jusa suffer yo
In the ghetto
Badman run wild
La la show times
Leak all those grids now
In The Ghetto
Them no response
Born a battyman
People jusa suffer yo

[Chorus]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I ain’t had to kill nobody

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raw killa, that nigga catpillar

Fuck you mean this is really mean

Future looking bright, bitches crack tongue on the pipe
I don’t wanna see you twerk, we about that fuck life
Got a Asian ho, pussy go deep, Jerry Rice

Don’t play with the grave digger, that’s RZA
Aks my bitch, she tell you ain’t no nigga
Like the one I got, dick game gorilla
Bag in my bag like a Philly nigga clip
Came extended grip, armor’s with the ruga, easy ruthless
Nigga with a attitude, my enemies is 2 shits
Don’t give 2 shits but you gon make a nigga pull it
But shit

[Bridge]

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
Today was a good day
Cuz I ain’t had to kill nobody
No I ain’t had to kill nobody
But I shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Duct tape, duct tape
Cover his mouth with duct tape
Check a nigga like a motherfuckin update
Where the safe nigga point to it
I catch a case, I wanna know who threw it
And my main bitches speak fluent
I keep the feds busy
I got the bread, never fed pigeons
Even though I get pissed off I shit on y'all
We gon sip champagne out your skull
I can’t stand these niggas, I’m bout to fall
Got my girl her shoes with the spikes, volleyball
Fuck with Holygrove, it’s gon be a holocaust
Hoes see me shinin, now they actin like a moth
YMCM bizzy, why I'm always busy

But I got my niggas with me and we got our skateboards
TTYL, thank thank You Lord
Amen, cuz uh

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My dawg hit me yesterday, got 15 keys

She said she want a perc I look at her like bitch please
And I show that ho up it like you ain’t tryna flip these
Yea I’m back nigga
Sellin all these bricks
And if my homies sell you one you better tell nobody shit
I tell them I’m back nigga
Rockin all these jewels and I be ridin through my hood like I ain’t got nothing to lose, shit
You thinking because I rap I won’t go buy them bricks
Give em to my dawg and let him do all kind of shit
Like take a point out, then put a point in
I fuck yo main ho and all my homies joined in
I’m getting money, must be the Iluminati
They think I signed up cuz I just bought a new Ferrari
But they said they want my mind, soul and my body
And I looked at that nigga crazy and then I shot him (BAH)

I ain't a gonna need this house no longer ain't a gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles ain't got time to fix the door
Ain't got time to oil the hinges nor to mingle the window panes
I ain't gonna need this house no longer I'm gettin' ready to meet the saints
This ole house once I knew my children this house once I knew my wife
This ole house was joy and comfort as we fought the storms of life
This ole house once rang with laughter this ole house heard many a shouts
Now she trembles in the darkness oh when the lightnin' walks about
I ain't a gonna need this house no longer...

[ piano ]

Now my old hound dog lies a sleepin' he don't know I'm gonna leave
Else he'd wake up by the fireplace and he'd sit there and gowl and grieve
But my huntin' days are over ain't gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel done brought in my chariot when the wind blew down the door
I ain't a gonna need this house no longer...

[Chorus]
We're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
You know I see you
And tell you you're so tight
My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
On New Year's Eve
And I do believe
On New Year's Eve
We can make it
We can live forever

11:59 and not a second later
She's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader
It's about to go down
No elevator
Live for the moment
Love in the air
She got me feeling like
I don't wanna be your player
Real talk
So I don't wanna be unfair
Now watch the apple drop
And celebrate the year
I see you shinin' away
From over there
And all the other girls
No, they don't compare
I whisper something bond to you
All up in your ear
I infiltrate your mind
And then I penetrate her
I get it crackin' baby
Call me the ... lady

[Chorus]
We're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
You know I see you
And tell you you're so tight
My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine

It's like the lights of midnight
On New Year's Eve
And I do believe
On New Year's Eve
We can make it
We can live forever

Grab a glass
Make a toast to the good life
Bacardi, lime and Ciroc
It will pass the time
Leather seats in the back of a Phantom ride
You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine
Master kush smoke for a master mind
My special lady
Only one of a kind
I never seen it comin'
I guess love is blind
New Year's watch the city come to life
I must say girl
You're looking right
Your hair did, nails did, dress
Fitting tight
I think I just might
See she's the one I like
See we can look forever girl
Let's get hot one night

[Chorus]
We're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
You know I see you
And tell you you're so tight
My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
On New Year's Eve
And I do believe
On New Year's Eve
We can make it
We can live forever
How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

[Chorus]
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

[Chorus]
And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

[Chorus]
I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you love you love you
(If I could turn back the hands)

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
You know one thing I hate
It’s when a person come up to me
Or I hear somebody say “it must be nice”
You know my answer that
Is “You must me a hater”
Tell me why you mad for
Listen Luda we gotta keep it real boy
We gonna do it like this baby
Listen here you know what I’m saying

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what they mad for
Come around the hood
See us sitting there looking good
Tell me what they mad for
Cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Time to start putting grown-ass men on time out
Go to the corner and cry somehwere man
Old insecure ass nigga
Your heart pump Kool-Aid man
What you mad at me for
Is it cause I got houses on every coast
Or that I’m on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
While they’re blowing that smoke
I’m blowing a couple million
Making a killing stunting on impostors
Only rapper in the game with a grammy and an oscar
7-figure movie deals, 8 figure bank runs
And I’m still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got i’ve altready drove
Any chick that you hit, nigga I’ve already ho’d
Say it with your chest like these diamonds on my tongue
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say “Ludacris is insane”
That niggas daughter’s birthday’s the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me but nobody’s fucking with me
Take in the sight of my cognac, more millions
Real G’s chug it with me
If I’m happy there’s no reason you should be sad for
So will somebody, can somebody please…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Ha!
Is you niggas hating ’cause you mad
Or is you mad ’cause you hating?
Choose one, hater
Now if these niggas hating on me I’mma kill them dead
If I wasn’t rapping I’d be probably be in the fifth
In the cell, getting mail, with a million dollar bail
But instead of counting blues, I’mma take this YSL
And this Gucci, and this Louis, Prada ’cause I’m hotter
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina and get dollars
I beefs up in my Bimmer, check aboard my collar
And when I check my bank account
I’m checking for them commas
I’m like all these niggas haters, all these bitches fucking
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothing
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stunting
And you nigga still talking all this money shit you bluffing
You bluffing, you bluffing, I really think you bluffing
100,000 dollars man them bottles we just crush ‘em
Now tell me why you hating? You hating ’cause you mad?
Or is you mad because you hating, boy you sad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Ok, I see why you mad, I’m counting all this money
And I’m popping all these tags
Hopping to it, Fucking bunnies
Real nigga, One hundred
You trying to do it, I done it
I spit sick on this rap shit
Make them sick to they stomach
I’m clean man, you hate
Mad ’cause I’m gonna keep it real with a real nigga
I got racks on racks, and a black maybach
Call it black on black, cause I kill niggas
In the club all girls, no niggas don’t talk to me
‘Cause I ain’t really trynna hear niggas
In the coupe it’s the truth
And the roof go poof, vamoose
I can make it disappear nigga
See this the type of shit that I be saying
Just because I’m balling, that don’t mean a nigga playing
Haters can blow me like a fan
Flyer than a bitch, I don’t think I’mma ever land
But in the meantime, baby what’s your plan
You can call me daddy but I can’t be your man
Fiending like the addicts, when I pull it out they panic
Bitch I do damage, you gonna need an ambulance

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime
Put one hand in the air if you know somebody
That’s mad at you right now for no reason
Riding around in my jeep
Bumping that 2pac
I’m walking around in my hood
Cocked back two Glocks
98 in my status
I came back I’m the baddest
Christian’s on my feet
I told you I’m the baddest
All the way in Paris
Don’t talk you’ll get embarrassed
My watch is fucking…
Yeah you get embarassed
My life is just Ludacris
Sucka you just new to this
430s pulling up
God damn we do this shit
Chickens and the waffles
Chilling in the villa
Bumping Ludaversal
Getting that scrilla

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Pusha T]
Yuck!
Hey Luda, you know why these haters mad for right?
The truth shall set you free
If you sellin’ all the records and you fuckin’ all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin’ out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin’ home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin’, is you dissin’
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won’t need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so I’m riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin’ I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye, be the motherfucking target for this killing
Ain’t y’all the motherfuckers with the millions?

[Hook]
Featuring Snoop Dogg

[Snoop Dogg talking]

Hahaha yeah

You're about to witness something you never thought you'd witness

Before

Check this out

[Snoop Dogg]

Welcome to the house the D O double G built

We got honey cream silk and milk

We make that big bank and keep that big shank

Just in case we get slapped into the home we take
Nigga don't think Dogg slips at all

I make chips for crips and the beat dogs

True niggas, do niggas, hey you niggas

Can't get with us 'cause we rip shit up

It's Mack Dime, and D-O dub

Here's a toast to the most, westcoast love

Fo sho though, I let you know from the get go

Pullin on my endo, rollin through the Wood with my kin dog

[Mack 10]

Not De La Soul, but fresh on parole

Now it's all about the hustle with the pebbles on swole

I'm know to the peoples as the Inglewood swanger

Been rollin gold Danas since a BG banger
It's a dog eat dog world in the city that I'm claimin

And niggas say we bangin 'cause our colors be flamin

But I'd rather push crack, let the bank roll stack

I show Snoop how to whoop and then I front him a sack

[Snoop Dogg]

Nigga better blue tennis shoes tidy, with our body

As I fall into the Mack 10 listenin party

Got greeted by some niggas who I never knew

Cold thing about it is that the niggas kept it true

Inglewood family is what they claim to bang

Street Rue and Maddog, I think that was his name

But anyway, what can I say?

Oh by the way, it's anybody 'kay?
So when you in LA, or nigga round my way

Give me a holler on the 310 or 213, yeah

[Hook:] X 3
Long Beach, with the ING

[Mack 10]

I'm makin green in the rap scene from coast to coast

And rollin three wheel motion from the woods to the ocean

See Snoop and Tray Dee in the LBC

And wasn't nobody trippin, just cool as can be

No harm up in (?) so the hatas got bigger

But they figure platinum niggas keep a gold plated trigger

And that's fo sho though, you know how it go

Jump in the low low and bang with the homies, fuck a hoe

So keep away crack and leave your bullet proof vest

Dogg there ain't no need for that, we headed west to the QS

Game recognize game, and it always should

It's all good and you niggas got a passion, Inglewood

Whoever trip get caught up in the middle like Monie

That's on the one and only I keep the big homies for the phonies

So let it be known, from my hood to your town

That connect game niggas is straight down with the Pound

[Snoop Dogg]

Now all my peoples in the LBC pull up a chair and have a dime bag on me

See we be DPGin this, we in this thang to make hits and bump a

Bitch and maintain

'cause the more better you get, the more cheddar you get

The more shit you talk, the more wet up you get

See, I found out quick, don't say shit

Just take care of yours, and handle it quick

Yeah, it don't stop for Biggie or Tupac

Niggas been gettin shot on my block

But we got to make a change and the thang is this

I keep my heater by my seater just in case y'all twist

But I wish upon a star

To stay down with Mack Dime, pushin caviar

The real recognize the real, I'll kill for that nigga

ING DPG, deal with it nigga, for real

[Hook] X 2

[Snoop Dogg]

They live on the streets, and they hustle for fame

Some claim twenty crip but most claim insane

See it's not a lifestyle, it's a full time job

And if you live in Long Beach, it's like a macabre

From blunt to blunt, everybody's bad

And if you don't know where you at you better tuck in your rag

Push heat on the street, with Chuck D's on his feet

Makin money slangin tapes up out the Compton swap meet

[Mack 10]

Up jumps the boogie some niggas gang bang

So keep a big steel if it's a real G Thang

But I kick back, relax, count hundreds by the stacks

And keep the yay on the stove till the whole key cracks

Ain't a busta in the crew, so I'm callin all hogs

It's connect gang rollin with the Pound and Snoop Dogg

And everythang all gravy like it's 'posed to be

It's Long Beach with the Ingle dub O-O-D city

[Hook] (till fade)
Yes it's true that I believe
I'm weaker than I used to be
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
Oh, and I forget the rest of me
Yes, there's times I've been afraid
And there's no harm in that I pray
'Cause I'm more frightened everyday
Someone will take the hope I have, away
But you gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know
All the times I've given in
You fit me like a second skin
And one by one I will begin
To wear you on the days I'm feeling thin
But you gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know
Hey, I gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give it up
To get off sometimes I know
You'd better stop, stop, stop
Using me up
You'd better stop
'Cause I've had enough
And I'm ready to forget the reasons
That keep me here
Ooh in the rain
You won't even if you never even gonna change
Good god need a little help, while
You'll find what you think you gonna be child
Ya, you'd better stop, stop, stop
Using me up
You'd better stop
'Cause I've had enough
And I'm ready to forget the reasons
Well the reasons keepin' me here

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Bridge: Sam Martin]
Woah, it's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on, baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on, baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Baby, this is getting serious

[Break: Steve Aoki]
Something in the night is dangerous
Hey sugar

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Detain the dangerous

[Bridge: Sam Martin]
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on, baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on, baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Baby, this is getting serious

[Break: Steve Aoki]
Something in the night is dangerous
Hey sugar
Everyday it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller-coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey

Everyday it's a-gettin' faster
Everyone said, "Go ahead and ask her"
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey

Everyday seems a little longer
Every way love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?

Everyday it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller-coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey

Everyday seems a little longer
Every way love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?
Everyday it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller-coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey
Love like yours will surely come my way
Gucci frames makin it hard for me to see
I'm in the club thinking like I'm in the street
I got a loaded German rifle on my seat
I spend a half million dollars in a week
Your love is rain
My heart the flower
I need your love or I will die
My very life is in your power
Will I wither and fade or bloom to the sky
Água de beber, give the flower water to drink
Água de beber, give the flower water to drink
The rain can fall on distant deserts
The rain can fall upon the sea
The rain can fall upon the flower
Since the rain has to fall let it fall on me
Água de beber, água de beber camará
Água de beber, água de beber camará

[Verse 1]
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out of the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I will leave with every part of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they keep me breathless, I can't help thinking

[Chorus]
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn, woah
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love keep me breathless, I can't help thinking

[Chorus]
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
To the beat beat beat beat

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
You know that there ain't no mountain high enough (I'm still in love with you)
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you (There ain't no mountain)
You know that there ain't no mountain high enough (There ain't no mountain)
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough (I'll be there oh baby)
To keep me from getting to you babe (Yes I will)

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat (Rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall)
I'm still in love with you, yes I am (Rolling in the deep, you're gonna wish you)
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Rolling in the deep)
Oh come on, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

So man your telling me you know her

[Chorus]
We messing with the same girl (same girl) same girl
How could the love of my life, and my potential wife be the
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Man I can't believe that we've been messing with the
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Thought she someone that I can trust
But she's been doubling up it on us
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl

[Verse 2]
See I met her at this party in Atlanta
Well I met her at this party in Chicago
She came right up to me given me conversation
I said do you got a man she sad no, with no hesitation
Well it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me
With a party all in my face, when I'm laughin' and buyin' her drinks

And she whispered in my ear and said can you take me home
Me too
Man she was in the Chi singin' that same song
Is that true
And I thought it was true confession when she said
I love you
Man I thought her body was calling when she said
I want you
Look I even got some pictures on my phone
Look at there how she's is with some boys shorts on

[Chorus]
We messing with the same girl (same girl) same girl
She's the apple of my eye, and my potential wife
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Man I just can't believe that we've been messing around with the same damn girl
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Thought she was someone that I can trust
But she's been doubling up with both of us
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl

[Bridge]
Said she got me on ringtone
Are you talking about the pink phone
Mm-mm the blue one
Man she told me that one was turned off
It's obvious that she's been playing us playing us
Or constantly she's been lyin to us lyin to us
Don't like the way that she's been goin bout it goin bout it
Kels what do you think that we should do about it do about it
Well call her up at her home, she won't know that I'm on the phone
Yeah man that's the way
Homie we about to bust this trick
Man just ask her to met up with you and I'm gonna show up too
And she won't know what to do
Well be standing there singing

[Chorus]
Same girl (same girl) same girl
She's was the apple of my eye, and your potential wife
Same girl (same girl) same girl
I just no can't believe that we've been messing with the same girl
Same girl (same girl) same girl
She gonna be lookin so stupid when she see us together
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl
See she was taken flights going back and forth

Oh can't believe it no

[Intro]
Tell you about these Taylors
Niggas that I ride for, ugh

[Sample]
When I get home
Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey

[Verse 1]
We get it on our own
Real niggas in the struggle, you're not alone
We ain't have any major label backin'
Just me and my niggas and we made sure we was crackin'
The biggest squad get the biggest check
Ask around, we the last real niggas left
And there ain't nobody like us
Knew that we was on but the city didn't like us
Fuck your road, made our own path
Grew up low class, I ain't go to class
Front on the gang and it won't last
You get no pass, ain't no goin' back

[Sample]
When I get home
Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey
When I get home
Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey

[Interlude]
You wouldn't have a clue
It's like I wouldn't have any idea what it feel like to be you

[Verse 2]
When you work hard for everything you got
They can't come take it
When you go back on sayin' you'll keep your word
You can't unbreak it
When we was in that sprinter van they couldn't see us ballin'
Perfect record, now my team is flawless
Victory nigga, promise I go hard til you sick of me
For my squad, I give all of my energy
Make it hard not to remember me
Want it all, not just a little piece
We really started from nothin'
No handouts dog, we really got it from nothin'
You niggas got it from stuntin', got it from frontin'
Light up a J, I'mma roll up an onion

[Sample]
When I get home
Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey
When I get home
Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey
When I get home
Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?

She said she never seen a ghost 'til she was in my rolls
Lookey here, I'mma keep it real with you
Get it clear, I ain't tryin' to chill with you
Give her here so I can put the steel in ya
Now, shorty bust it open for a real nigga

[Chorus]

Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I'd gladly go

[Hodgy Beats:]
I'm tired of these hoes (hoes)
I need a real bitch
To handle all the things
That I don't wanna deal with, oh
I said I need a real bitch
She buys her own accessories, and her heels sick
That's a real bitch
She really want me a lot, but she kills dick
Now that's a real bitch, and I'm a real nigga
And we the realest
Fuck real estate, we in the realest state
Counting paper bills behind the bill of gates
Peak out my Left Eye, look at her Chilli face
Could this be TLC, or is it really hate
I need a real bitch
Where my bitches at?

[Left Brain:]
Where my bitches at? 

[x4]
Yeah, man, a real bitch
She come home
Cook a nice little meal for a nigga, you know what I'm sayin
A real bitch
Don't motherfucking run her mouth and shit, you know what I mean
Real bitches wash the dishes, you know what I mean
Real bitches
Help out to pay the bills and shit
You know what I'm saying
Give a nigga a massage when they come home from a long day at work
Some real bitch shit
Where my real bitches at?

[Taco:]
I need a real bitch
Who can make french toast and suck dick
She's 5'6" with firm tits
Went to UCLA until she met my dick
You wanted to be a doctor? I bet you did
But if if was a fifth then you wouldn't be my bitch
Making steak and bacon, that's your job, you stupid trick
Your daddy's rich, indeed, now please hit your knees
My dick won't suck itself
If it wasn't for my cock, you would have bad health
You crave my junk
Kick-box lessons so you won't get pregnant
I pull that bastard out myself, on some real nigga shit
I trap, you suck, and the world fucking spins
Swag 

[x4]

[Left Brain:]
Riding with my bitch and you know she hella chil
Coachella, front row, baby girl pop a pill
Show me how you feel, bitch keep it real

I see you
Um, a real bitch

Her own motherfucking vehicle
And of course she paying for that motherfucker cause she a real bitch
You know what I'm saying, she handle her own business
A real bitch
Don't play no games at all

Don't say no pillowtalk up in this motherfucker

And a real bitch gotta know how to roll my weed up

What you don't know
What you can't see
What you don't realize you once had until you see that it's not free
And as for us
It's not clear
The clouds ain't always bad if when they fade it's love
That they reveal

And I'm moving on
'Cause you set me free
And I'm trying to be as much of myself as if you were here with me
And I'm feeling lost
But it's not unheard
And while you go on living your life
I'm still stuck here
Living in your words

Well there was good
And there was bad
But I took for granted the way you made me laugh
And the way you spoke
Only I could hear
And the way I saw myself in you as if I were
Staring in a mirror
Oh oh
And I'm moving on
'Cause you set me free
And I'm trying to be as much of myself as if you were here with me
And I'm feeling lost
But it's not unheard
And while you go on living your life
I'm still stuck here
Living in your words

And I'm moving on
'Cause you set me free
And I'm trying to be as much of myself as if you were here with me
And I'm feeling lost
But it's not unheard
And while you go on living your life
I'm still stuck here
Living in your words
Living in your words
Living in your words

And I'm feeling lost
'Cause it's not unheard
And while you go on living your life
I'm still stuck here
Living in your words
Living in your words
Living in your words
Living in your words
Living in your words
Haaaa
(Come on baby)
Haaaa
(One night)
Haaaa
(One night only)
You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I had no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really don't have the time
I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only
Let's not pretend you care
I've got one night only
One night only
Come on, we better come on
One night only
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn)
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn!)
One night only
One night only
One night only (Oh)
One night only (Yeah-yeah)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
You and I will be running out of time!
Whoo yeah (Come on, come on)
Whoo, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, yeah (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)

Baby, what we gon' do?
I need you to talk to me, c'mon

[are. Kelly]
Suddenly, I feel the need - to pull you close to me
But I don't know, if it's what you want, baby
Girl show me some kind of sign
That tells me that you're, miiiine, all mine, baby
It's gettin awfully warm, off in this room
I'm gettin head up off yo' sweet perfume
And I'm ready, to explore, every part of you
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, then now you
Ooooooooooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo baby
Baby.. Tonight we'll be, naked
Oooooooh, oooooooh, oooooooh, ooooooooh
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love
And show you so so much
Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture
Gettin you open like matchin doors
Sheets and covers on, the floor
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you
Wanna tell, what I want from you
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
So dim the lights
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
I wanna see you tonight
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
Ohhh-ohhh, naked
Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, shoop, shoop
Shoop be doop, shoop, shoop

[Verse 1]
There's a river running sweat right through our land, through our land
Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand, in his hand
And I've taken just as much as I can stand, I can stand
Oh we've got to free our brothers from their shackles if we can, if we can

[Verse 2]
Most nights I have to watch my woman cry, won't you cry
Every day I watch the colonel smile, oh he smiles
His painted ladies riding in from town, in from town
Oh, I swear one day I'm gonna burn that whorehouse to the ground, to the ground

[Chorus]
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

[Verse 3]
There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come, yet to come
That may free our families free our and our sons, and our sons
It can lay green lands to waste the barren wastes of the wastes
Oh, the price of release is a bitter blow to face of the face

[Chorus]
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave

Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave, slave
To face the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave
How Insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say
What can you say when a love affair is over

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just stare in icy silence

Ah, porque você
Foi fraco assim
Assim tão desalmado
What was I to do
What can one do when a love affair is over

I don't even think they see me, hoes disappear, Houdini
I get what I wanna, you would think I own a genie
If I ain't on my corner, probably on your TV
Pimping these hoes like Joseline, "why you do that Stevie?"
Play no games with these bitches, they treat me like I'm Tony
I put cheese on you rats, get hit with that macaroni
Bout them collard greens all these rappers be acting phony
You sold your soul for some food and went broke, now you salty
You want your cornbread?
Give me that, give me that, get me that, niggas that's old bread
Spending that, flipping that, get it back with my old heads
Small face hundred, my nigga we call that more bread
You don't want me goin' in! Meek Milly

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Uh.. niggas talking reckless, but they barely moving records
Niggas talking Rayful, but can't even move a pebble
BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG! WHOOOO~! (Duck!)
BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!
They shooting at whoever
Look, I ain't tryna be no killer
But I know I got beaucoup of 'em that's with me
D'Ussé on that Rémy, quit 'em if they linger
You get them Jordan feet, I give these hoes Mutumbo fingers
BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG!
Too raw for these niggas
Wale Folarin, I'm playing them all
Like A-Rod to these niggas
And I pick 'em apart with that flow
And my car beyond what y'all drove
And I got a few top optional, every night is Marti Gras, ho!
And I heard your boy this scared ho
So we down in Florida Joe we ain't playing no more
I'm finna bully you artists, being Incognito

[Outro: Future]
Ain't no bottles on your table, pussy boy go get your gwalla
(Remix! Remix! Remix!)
Hustlin' is a habit and we might not see tomorrow
(DJ's all around the world, Double MG, le'go)
Ain't no bottles on yo table, pussy boy go hey yo gwalla
(MasterMind, Double M, Tracy T, Fat Trel, Stalley - WHOOO!)
We some rich ass niggas and surrounded by these models
My vehicle foreign (we the richest) I'm buried in foreign (WHOO! Let get it, get it)
I put all that on ery'thang (get it, get it), my niggas is some savages (WHOO! Get it, get it - BANG!)
Are you going to Scarborough Fair:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

On the side of a hill in the deep forest green
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested brown
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine

On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves
Washes the grave with silvery tears
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

Tell her to find me an acre of land:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine
War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
General order their soldiers to kill
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather:
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Run out by my mama
And every girl just gives me drama
All my friends are lookin' older
But you still look the same

And I'm standin' on the corner
I see you walkin' on by
Askin' if I'm doin' fine
Like you're some friend of mine
Oh, you must have lost track of time

And yes, I got your letter
I didn't think they wrote those anymore
And no, I ain't feelin' much better
But I ain't still feelin' so sore

[Chorus]
Nobody told me that being lonely
Was what good lovin' could do
I'll be your brother, I'll be your sister
I'll show you everything new
Oh, I'll show you everything new

[Verse 2]
It's rainin' in Chicago
The rain falls on my window
It's been a while since we've spoken
I guess my doorbell must be broken

And I'm spendin' all my money
I got to get some luck on my side
Drivin' in the rain, early in the morning
With the sun risin' up in the sky, oh

[Chorus]
You ain't from 'round here
Why'd you come down here?
Must be a long way from home
Forget the distance
It don't mean nothin'
You're callin' me on the phone
But ah haw...
You only call when I'm gone

[Verse 1]
I enjoy you, I never wanna see you leave, girl
You've made my life so complete and I don't (I don't)
Wanna move too fast, no
'Cause you're too special

[Pre-Chorus]
I really love the way, I do
You make me feel inside
You wonder why my
Spirit is so happy, hey

[Chorus]
You touch my heart, every part (Oh, oh, oh)
Whenever you speak to me
I love what we (I love) have going on
(I may never)
I may never find another (Never) one like you, for me

[Verse 2]
I have no worries once I step into your presence
You have a way of helping me
See that everything's okay, babe (Huh)
What else can I say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I really love the way, I do (The way)
You make me feel inside
You wonder why my
Spirit is so happy, girl, you

[Chorus]
You touch my heart (Oh, yes you did), every part
Whenever you speak to me (Yes, I love)
I love what we (What we got going on) have going on
(I may never find)
I may never find another (No, no) one like you (Like you), for me

[Bridge]
We started out
Saying that we would just be friends
But special feelings have arisen
What are we supposed to do now here in the meanwhile?

[Pre-Chorus]
I really love the way, I do (The way)
You make me feel inside (Ooh)
You wonder why my
Spirit is happy
'Cause you came in and changed the meaning of a true friend
And this is just the beginning

[Chorus]
You touch my heart (My heart), every part (Every part, girl)
Whenever you speak to me (Yes, I love)
I love what we (What we got going on, girl) have going on
(I may never, girl, oh, oh)
I may never find another (I may never find, girl, the one) one like you (Like you, yeah), for me

[Outro]
I don't wanna waste this opportunity, oh
(I may never find another one like you for me)
I may never find, I may never find no one like you, ooh
The odds are not in my favor
(I may never find another one like you for me)
I gotta savor every moment 'cause of you
It wouldn't be wise if I let time pass me by
(I may never find another one like you for me)
'Cause I can't go without you in my life
Hey, I may never find
(I may never find another one like you for me)
I may never find
I may never find another
Yo I'm sayin, these Ruff Ryder Niggas

Gun who, oh you don't know what the gun do
Some do, those that know are real quiet
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up foreal, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill is all I've been hearin lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefin but a lot of them bluffin
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough
Not just for frotin
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?' the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasin em down
We all knew that you was pussy but I'm tastin it now
And never give a dog blood because raw blood
I have a dog like one bitin whatever
All up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that and ain't no love I do em all like that

Keep me runnin from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes
Hittin niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin up the spot when you rot plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problem
Aight
She walks like an angel walks
She talks like an angel talks
And her hair has a kind of curl
To my mind, she's my kind of girl

She's wise like an angel's wise
With eyes like an angel's eyes
And a smile like a kind of pearl
To my mind, she's my kind of girl

A pretty little face
That face just knocks me off my feet
A pretty little feet
She's really sweet enough to eat

She looks like an angel looks
She cooks like an angel cooks
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
To my mind, she's my kind of girl

(full instrumental interlude)
Hmmm, pretty little face
That face just knocks me off my feet
Pretty little feet
She's really sweet enough to eat
She looks like an angel looks
And she cooks like an angel cooks
And my mind's in a kind of whirl
To my mind, she's my kind of girl

Yes, my poor heart's in a whirl
She's just my kind, she's a girl
And I'm glad
It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round

Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze

The world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball, just for a song
Get out and roll it along

It's a yum yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late?
In winter, it's a marshmallow world

[Verse 1]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer...

[Pre-drop]
Just drop the bass

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
When I met you in the summer (Summer)
To my heartbeat's sound (Yeah, yeah)
We fell in love (Love)
As the leaves turned brown (Yeah, yeah)
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue (Yeah, yeah)
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon (Yeah, yeah)
When I met you in the summer...

[Pre-drop]
Just drop the bass

[Drop]
I'd like to do some more songs about buildings and food
This is a song about liver, very high in protein, very good for ya
Hope you like it

I don't know why
You feed me so bad
Think of all the health food
I could've had

You took-a my yogurt
And my whole wheat bread
You give me Ding Dongs
And Twinkies instead

I wanna know
Can you tell me
When is it going to end

Take me to the liver
Push it on my platter
Give me a piece of liver
Oh, drop it on my platter
Scarfin' it down
Scarfin' it down
I'm gonna catch the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
Yeah, first train home
I don't know what I come here for
'Cause for nine long years
I couldn't even walk out of my door
Hear what I say
I'm gonna catch the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
The first train, the first train home
I don't know what I come here for
'Cause for nine long years
I couldn't even walk out of my door

[DJ Khaled]
We the best
I represent the hood
I represent the ghetto
I represent the people

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because.....
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'

[The Game]
Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah thats what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
Thats why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the fourty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga yall made my city bigger dawg
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From compton to being Dre's number one prospect so.....

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

[Jadakiss]
AAHHAA!!!
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Ain't no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there

Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know eachother if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
Theres dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

[Trick Daddy]
Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we dont see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your adress changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared... The ghetto will still be here

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because.....
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto

All over the world and every hood they know

To a nord star, speaking of start, get me

Bitches try to blow a kiss, I walked up in the club
And I ain’t on the fucking list
DJ see me and they be like “J-Doe in this bitch”
Then the club turn up
Get my kick game mean, I be rocking everything
The chain never seen, I ain’t got a scuff on me
Boy you know I’m clean, they said that they had ‘em

I talk shit like Ricky Flaire, you talk shit not backin’ up
My goons come from my crazy house and all I do is strap’em up
Appointed you, they clap you up and we live lives with thears up
Lookin’ at my neck and wrist thing that cost a kill or two
How the fuck should make a keysha staced at a care or two
Ronnie and Johanna to a lime dime of gin or two
I’m in the zone like 3 on 2, my flo be on supersquirt
My money should kill talk, you better be super sharp
In the pandomera, they don’t know this is coover short
All the fuckin’ ballin’ bitches thinking that I roof the shore
Swish, kept in rollin’, I be prolly with your bitch
Think you know me, I be prolly in the mix
Like cheeks to these presses and some chips

Uh, now I control the streets no remote
And you see me gettin’ more blessed since them teevo
The women hit me up everyday the same queue
My Facebook friend request it’s going through the roof
And I’m just tryna keep up
I’m firestein, never been second
My swag so sharp I can use it as a weapon
Baby you to fine right here, come meet somebody better
You know that time is money and he can’t buy you a second
Meanwhile my bank account is climbing
Now it’s landing on an island
Got a hundred thousand problems and cup with sharpest bottom
And my sweeter happened to meet up on the beach
She whispered in my hear her heart goes for streets
She said she like my belt wich’s matchin’ with my shirt
Wich’s matchin’ with my shoes so she decided to flirt
My style got her higher than the somking on the purp
Now in it with a shift enough to liften up her skirt
You know I make ‘em…

Too glamorous
Meek Mill
Maybach (Maybach)
Oh, yeah!
We good!
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Guitar solo]
Merry Christmas

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
Oh, to you

[Chorus (Jay-Z)]
The power of the P-you-S-S-Y
Thatz why every mutherfucka in the world dress fly
Every baller
That can afford it they cop the best ride, for the power of the P-you-S-S-Y
(Let's have some fun)
The power of the P-you-S-S-Y, thatz why niggas get they hair cut, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it he cop the best ride
For the Power of the P-you-S-S-Y

[Jay-Z]
I-I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, thatz all it took
One sample of the snappa and ya ass was whooped
Have you buyin Gucci sandals matchin pocketbooks
Blowin up her beeper, ringin her phone off the hook
Ball playaz they spent money, rappers they spent time
All the while both claimin that they never spent a dime
Buisness guys you were victimised
Have 'em payin rent on condos in a Miami High Rise
They ask her, "Who pussy's this?"
Look her right in her eyes
She say, "This pussy's yours, Daddy"
Tell 'em nothin but lies
Ha! They didn't believe it, but they wanted to
Needed to. She had the type of body that you didn't want leavin you
So they ignored all her flirtin ways and put a ring on her finger
I'm like, "Earth to Dave!"

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]
Naw.. I ain't no rapper but I'mma sing my shit
When it comes down to that mutherfuckin click click click
Niggas I sip sip sip, turn on ya quick quick quick
And thatz why I be givin mami much dick dick dick
While yall chumps be copin diamonds and fur and all that
Fiendin for this pussy as if yall was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Ya'll cats that be babysittin these broads need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe that I know from way back
He hit the lotto, bought this girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin behind this niggas back
Me bust his nut guess what he still took the bitch back
Three things niggas love... Money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other unless you soft and in love
Yall take it from a playa who's done all the above
Niggas it the lesbian R&B thug

[Chorus:]

[Devin the Dude]
The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle
The you is for uterus, down deep in the middle
Ss is so slippery when I go up inside
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y
See I got my first shot when I was bout 7
Her father called my house he said
"I need to talk to yo son Devin
My daughter she's 11 and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to
And she said today she got screwed. "
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was
"No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!"
Then I was suspended 3 day, tooken from school
It was like a vacation
Niggas lookin at pussy at the pool in our apartments
I started hittin hard when I was small
Let me recite a story lesson for all of yall
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels
Cuz it's...

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]
Oh yeah
Niggas will do anything for some pussy
Hey Hey Hey!
Oh! See it don't matter who you are
Where you from, in this life at some point ya gonna wanna get you some
Yes you will
Ooo. Oh! I know
You know Dasher and Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
You know Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
Say, but do you recall
That most important reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

But then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say:
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history."
Rock it, Rudolph
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say:
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus: Pharrell]
She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm with it

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky

My love, I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love, you held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
You taught me how to live again

Only you, cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

My love, whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend, with you I'll always have a friend
Someone who I can depend
To walk the path that sometimes bends

Without you, life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you

[Kesha - Intro]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

[Wiz Khalifa]
Okay I'm young and I'm tatted
I get them bucks like an addict
In this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fucking rich, so I'm an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think its time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it
No it's not a problem, better get it, then I won't be here tomorrow momma

[Kesha] x2
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
And I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

[Andre 3000]
We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy so that HE wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only 8, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 1980s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say "Stacks, you're true blue?"
I said "Nah, I'm Navy"
I call her Kesha, she like it, because it's hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 because I'm good to her

[Kesha] x2
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
And I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

[T.I]
Hey Kesha what up boo its me
Do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got two of me
Well you better make it two or three
Bad bitches know me so don't bother introducing me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I'm super clean
I'm hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
I'm ballin', royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin', I'm just here, couldn't catch you when I catch you
Bitch my swagger super natural
Get you pregnant looking at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes
I'm an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paint ballin' out the frame, stuntin' like a fool

[Kesha - Hook]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bouji friends
I don't need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!

[Lil Wayne]
We be on that shit that no one be on
Thats what we one, smoke that neon
Kings of Leon, Dynamite Napoleon
Got some skinny's and a tee on
And some vans and my mans got the ratchet
While I'm laying in some pussy you be laying in a casket
And I'm just saying, I'm just spazzing
Im just smashing, Im just nasty
If you 'bout it, bust it open
Oh you fancy man, I got so many flows like mansion
Catch a tantrum, know a girl called Cleopatra
She a throw that pussy at ya
I'm financially straight like a lion

And all my hoes on they toes
Ballerina, Black Swan

.
Been walking in circles so long
My head is spinning, direction's gone
The night is darkest just before the dawn
So goodbye, my friend, it's time to move on

I'm taking some time to clear out my mind
To change up the light

Oh, why did I leave it so long?
Drawn in and caught up in the throng
I guess I'm saying that this time I was wrong
Remembering is hardest when you're alone

Broken and cold, stuck on a map
Well on my way to Medicine Hat
(Oh lord, I can feel it)
When me look in your eyes, fo' sho'
(Can you feel it?)
Me haffi make you mine, let's go

'Cause I want you and need you right here love

She dance to reggae and calypso
She's my type of description
Here I come
(Here I come)
Baby, baby, you fine as hell

But I just don't mind if you cheat
'Cause you're not my lady, lady
And the situation got us acting shady, shady
'Cause I want you here

When me look in your eyes, fo' sho'

The way you dance and move

Baby, baby, you fine as hell
And I know I might sound crazy, crazy

(Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord)
Well East coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
The Mid-West farmer's daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls
The West coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand
I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)

[AIDA]
It's knowing what they want of me that scares me
It's knowing, having followed, I must lead
It's knowing that each person there compares me
To those in my past whom I now succeed
But how can whatever I do for them now be enough?
Be enough

[NUBIANS]
Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!

[NEHEBKA]
Your robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect
Instead of this ragged concoction of thread
But may you be moved by its desperate beauty
To give us new life, for we'd rather be dead
Then live in the squalor and shame of the slave
To the dance!

[NUBIANS]
Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!

Aida...!

Aida! Aida!
Aida! Aida!
Aida!

[AIDA]
I know expectations are wild and almost
Beyond my fulfillment, but they won't hear
A word of a doubt or see signs of a weakness
My nigh-on-impossible duty is clear
And if I can rekindle our ancestors' dreams, it's enough
It's enough

[NUBIANS]
Aida! Aida! Aida!
Aida! Aida! Aida!

[AIDA]
It's enough!

[NUBIANS]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Stray dog is walkin' down the street
Next to another dog
They're eating mud and
Starting to smell me
Two babies
Dangerous and free

When I got home I told my baby
The story
She said to me
"I think you're funny, you saw
What you wanted to see"
And I said

"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy"

Feel like a million eyes on me
Feel like a cannon ball I see
A tree, it loses all its leaves
And you are dead to me
You watch someone you know
Grow into static company
And now you see
Do you wish you were?
"I am not the boy you knew"

[Jay-Z]
Man, they go and tell me like
You never know who your true friends until you ah umm
Both got a little bit of money
I mean cause y'all both broke
Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see

[are. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is dat?)
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

[Jay-Z]
Look, I'm a grown man dog
And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all
"He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able"
Well, nigga you've been wrong before
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
We move through the hood like identical twins
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin
You showed your true colors, y'all niggas stay yappin
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin? (sup nigga)
Fake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

[are. Kelly]
I wish, I wish - that success, we could all
Get a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)
Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger
And do things like, pull up to some clubs
In the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out hey!
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors
But y'all niggas don't appreciate shit
Helped you out and you still actin like a little bitch
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row
When you asked me for some tickets to my tp-2 show
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow

[Chorus + ad libs]

[Jay-Z]
A-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)
We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game
How he jeapordized the whole game
Now when we see each other it's so strange
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin
But what I do know, all the niggas that you know
Locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules

[Chorus:]
Hey, hey
Wassup little homie
Yo big homie what's goin' down?
Get in nigga

Ride, this mothafucka fresh
Ya ride with me, I need ya to hit a corner with me
Let's do this
Yeah, nigga I know you like dis, nigga
I gonna said you one day up

Check this out though lil' homie
I got this move for ya man
This sucka ass nigga over here
We gunna pull up on this nigga house right here
Nigga, stay right here

This nigga a bitch, man
Ya you know this nigga, he's from the hood
Nigga ain't kickin' this shit
He got major, major chips
We're tryin' to have a piece of that
Check it out though
I want you to slide up to the do'
Right
When this nigga open up the do'
Dogg, I want you to go and lay him down
This nigga ain't gunna do shit, he's a bitch
You da little homie

He can't do nothin' to you, nowhere
That's on everything
Now go on in there and handle that shit, lil' homie, I'm out here waitin' out here on ya
It's done double OG, be right back

Oh, shit
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
Slow your motherfuckin' roll nigga
Slow your roll
Damn
I don't know just how it happened, I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
I wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing though my veins
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
Midnight blows in through the window; dances round the room
Got me hypnotized; I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
*chorus*
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
Heart colder then chicago, middle of december cause my life is like a slideshow
Fast as its coming as fast as its going, my friends & the women like my money just blowin'
In the wind damn thought they was rollin till the end
My mama told me them niggas wasn't rollin up again
So its blood over water, family over a friend
Too much water will drown ya, that blood flows thru your skin
That blood flows from your heart told me go for the start
And if you turn off my lights i bet i glow in the dark
I bet you i shine bright, bright as a prom night
Them youngin's they tryna murder them niggas ain't tryna fight
Cause mama was never there father they never met, so love dont live there
They shooting or better yet, they scheming instead of dreamin, murkin instead of workin
They locking them in them prisons but really those youngings hurting now
*chorus*
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
"you wanna take care of that buisness? you wanna smoke oh really? since your punk as daddy you ain't got the heart to put in the work
"spent 10 years of prison for puttin in work"
Shawty 16 fuckin everything moving, got raped by her stepdad he told her just do it
No job tellin the pussy to get to it
Drinking and smoking anything to get thru it
And love dont live there, struggling she been there
She ain't got no heart shawty like the tin-man
Sell her anything she won't feel it like its thin air
She done heard everything you could drop a pin there, and shed prolly hear it
Lookin in the mirror, staring at her reflection and it scares her
Everytime that she crys feeels like nobody hear it
Devil ALL in the air hes wispering hes there, she hear him
Everybody frontin on her like shes rosa parks, tryna push her in the back where it was dark
Shes like a goldfish they got her swimmin with the sharks
A year later found her murdered lying in the park
*chorus*
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
"philadelphia police are still trying to piece together the death of teenage girl found partially clothed in fairmount park
Today action news reporter karina nova said following developments he joins us at police headquarters tonight with the very latest"
*chorus*
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore

[RADAMES]
There'd be no ties of time and space to bind us

[AIDA]
And no horizon we could not pursue

[BOTH]
We'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind us
And I will put my faith and trust in you
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

How often at night where the heavens are bright
With the light of the glittering stars
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours
Home, home on the range

Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Then give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down to the stream
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream
Oh I would not exchange my old home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where the seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
I know they hatin' on me, 'cause I'm the man
I'm too trill homie, I don't give a damn
I'm a self made trillionaire

[Verse 1]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say—

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Verse 2]
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say—

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting

[Final Chorus]
And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

[Outro]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, are you listening?
Oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Drop]
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Verse:

So high, what's beneath me, I can't even call it high
Like taking holders when the season started
It ain't much to say when actions speak for themselves
So just the fact that I'm in this motherfucker means I'm balling
So next time you take shots keep an extra cartridge
Niggers handcuffing hoes like the police department
You think you flying but you really falling
You just ain't hit the concrete yet nigga, you're stalling
They say pop means being popular to the population
So excuse me for being the topic of your conversation
I just keep banging verses and rocking your mama's braces
What you blaze in a week, that's what I start my day with
My checks worth more than your net worth
I got a network about the size of the next earth
I'm laid up, so much head that my neck hurt
I'm living a dream, I never once with the bed first you dig
So what should I do with so much hate?
Fuck it, I turn crabs into bucket to a buffet
And beef to a filet;  that's a full-course Entrée
And girl I turn that avocado to some guacamole
So Spanish girls only, we can skip the foreplay
Roll up some good haze and stay high for 4 days
We can do it 4 ways, left right, up down
My cup running over but I won't put my cup down
You haters cheer-leading while I'm out here running touch downs
But I won't be ran down, I run shit, you ran down

[?] Blowing whistles like please get the sun down
Me while I'm globetrotting from sun up to sun down
But still I'm straight, 

[?]
No time to play cause I know they don't want me on top, 

[?]
But still I'm blazed, so many trees, don't need no shades
Living that Stamp Life, I think my passport need mo' space
Outro:

Haha, yeah, it's B. O. B.O. Bitch
All you hater, I don't even wanna hear no
I don't even know why I got smoked for...
But still man, you know how I do it
Grand hustle in the building, yo
... It's a problem, yo, feel it...

[Intro]
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Every fog, every rain, every thunder
On this road, seems like it'll never end
So I stray and I wonder, I don't wanna crash again
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say, some things never get better
Some wrongs never get right
Sometimes people need more than what's inside

[Chorus]
And I know, that you center me
And I know, that you center me
You center me

[Verse 2]
Then one day, I'm the life of the party
I'm the real thing, I'm your everyman
Then I fall from the grace, from the glory
I lose all my faith again
Oh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say nothing's gonna be perfect
Perfect's all in your mind
And all these demons, I can't give up this fight
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I know, that you center me
And I know, that you center me
And I know, that you center me
And I know, that you center me

[Bridge]
When I lose my way, when anger fills my soul
When I get too high on myself, and when it gets too cold
Oh, oh, oh, I know you'll bring me back to life
Oh, oh, I know, you'll make it seem alright
Alright, alright
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I know, you center me
And I know, you center me
And I know, you center me
And I know, you center me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
And I know, you center me
You center me
You center me

[P. Diddy]
This goes out to my nigga B.I.G
Listen to me playboy, check dis out
I go, on and on and on and
Won't take her to the crib unless she's bonin'
PD call her on the phone and
Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine
We ain't, the type to sit back and lose focus
Spit that mack-a-docious
Most ferocious
Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters
You must know this, the cats 'm with is the coldest
Hip-hop quota but quote this
Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'
Please believe it, we on top and won't leave it

[Chorus: Kokane]
Sometimes I feel like I'm lonely
And sometimes I feel like I'm lonely

[Kain]
Uh, uh, yeah
Hey yo see-I-O-F-F-I-E
Q-you-double E-N-Z
Come on ma your riding with me
Leave the lame respect the game
When you hanging on my arm you expect the same
And, ecstasy when you sex the Kain
I, only link with the wealthiest
And only cop jewels if it drop Celsius
Now, you can run but you can never hide
But, where you go when the temperature rise
It's Bad Boy see death in ya eyes
Kain Cioffe the next on the rise
Damagin' shit hot stamina split
You got screwball raps we the hammerin' clique
Limo, the club, and the cameras'll flip
Money, music women son we standin' in it HA!

[Chorus]

[Mark Curry]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't panic, don't take this for granted
I did then still do and always ran it
A lot to gain when I say I'm off the chain
The shit I spit, burn flames
Who's controllin' this
I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am
Don't get it all twisted up
Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door
Not partyin' and pimpin', I walk wit a limp
Once I took it to the top I ain't fell off since
Stay high stay fly stay cool in the fan
Ain't none of yall seein' ya man
Get a grip niggas

[Chorus]

[Kokane: x2]
(On guard, defend your self) It's lonely at the top hey hey
How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do keep the song from fading
Too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things
To say?

My funny valentine...
Sweet, comic valentine...
You make me smile with my heart

And since you know we're always changing
..Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
How can it be the same
..Yet your my favorite work of art
You're sure your heart will fall apart
..Is your figure less than Greek?
Each time you hear her name
..Is your mouth a little weak?
..When you open it to speak, are you smart?
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
..Don't change a hair for me
..Not if you care for me

Stay little valentine
Please stay

With any luck than I suppose
..Each day is valentine's day
The music never ends

Winter time
Summer time
Evening time
Or any time
I love you
U-huh, uh-huh
U-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh
(Shake ya body body, move ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Twist ya body body, switch ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Dip ya body body, work ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Anybody body, everybody body)
Pub-o, drank-o, 'dro plus the bev-o
Hands in the air-o, holla like echo
Tone's in the dub with, momo and poke-o
Tone be like Kujo, I be like Cecil
Fists rockin' like 'Adrian'
We come through like 'Superfriends'
Tick-tock, tick-tock, it's six o'clock
And the party won't stop, bout to hit the I-Hop
Got twenty inch mirrors rollin' under the drop
So clap that shit up y'all and make it hot
Uh-huh
(Shake ya body body, move ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Twist ya body body, switch ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Dip ya body body, work ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Anybody body, everybody body)
New York, Chicago, Atlanta, L.A
Miami crazy like yippie-i-yae
Rude boys in the club smokin' on hay
Smoke the choker weed, Cali and the bay
Real live niggas, put y'all hands up
Wanna get tossed, drink that liquor
Who's got the industry locked, Kelly and Jigga
Trackmasters, turn that shit up
Uh-huh
(Shake ya body body, move ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Twist ya body body, switch ya body body)
Uh-huh

We got honies everywhere
Corks off the Cris' poppin' everywhere
Partyin' hard like we just don't care
The best of both worlds, that shit ain't fair
This shit ain't fair, I am Jay, hov'
Mami shake ya body body, don't hurt nobody hottie
It's me in the god-body, R. Kelly, the John Gotti
Of R&B thug and me I would say I'm probably
The hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and put it in a song
Ma how could you go wrong?
Ha ha ha ha worse than a armed robbery
Know that I'm armed properly, whenever the arm's rocky
You can go on clockin' me, ain't nuttin' gon' stop me
High as Allah I be, movin' in peace but I
Move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets
Will never remove my piece, ha ha, got me
Niggas'll never get me, I never move sloppy
Move with the Glock 50, got some Tupac with me
Let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses
Mami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic
Make a hole, make a hole and let the queen come past
I come through in the speedboat, with 808's in the glass
Push big things here, bet most of y'all crash
Back to trainin' lightweights, you in the wrong weight class
Haters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem shake
We 'Slam' dance like onyx, check my Ebonics
You got, heat nigga you thinkin' we won't blaze?
Gotta come hard 'cause these are the last days
When I do it I do's it, ain't no more to it
Ask Ice Cube I puts my back into it
From car dealers to Macy's, the cashiers embrace me
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be
I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much
I want the bulletproof 7 'cause the doors lift up
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?
I got the best of both worlds, holdin' me down
Uh-huh
(Shake ya body body, move ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Twist ya body body, switch ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Dip ya body body, work ya body body)
Uh-huh
(Anybody body, everybody body)
Uh-huh

[Intro]
My youngin' got the chopper
Once he turn around it's that “blocka, blocka, blocka!”
Go hit 'em with the chopper
Once he turn around it's that “blocka, blocka, blocka!”

[Bridge]
I know you heard me through your radio
I know you heard me through your stereo
100 chains on with my fitted
'Bout to kill the game, nigga, here we go
And I pull that on me
And the Feds got a case, try to put that on me
If shorty got ass, go on, put that on me
Milli in the bag, man, I put that on me

[Hook]
And my youngin got a chopper
Once he turn around it's that “blocka, blocka, blocka!”
And my youngin got the choper
Once he turn around it's that “blocka, blocka, blocka!”

[Verse 1]
If you want it with my shooter, then nigga, pull up then
He'll knock yoir ass off for a light 10
You a coward if you kill a nigga in the night then
Say you gangsta, we'll kill a nigga in the light then
Didn't wait 'til the police come, right then
And if you don't run, it'll make you look right then
God say it's to kill, he right then
We all righteous, I'm the other righteous man
Righteous killings – do it cool as a fan with it
Okay, that is God's work, y'all niggas is playin' with it
Manslaughter a nigga, bare hands with it
That nigga a real pussy, I was in the can with him
Young Dro, not the averager – solid gold damager
Y'all niggas sleep, I wake 'em up like I'm Rabika
I used to fuck with Keisha, now I'm fuckin' with Tabitha
I'm in the kitchen, flippin' this cakes, no spatula

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I say money is the mission, we murder without permission
Kilos in the kitchen, the pot, stove in the kitchen
My niggas gettin' richer 'cause niggas know they position
If money talk then all you broke niggas should listen
Everybody hatin' on me, it's like, who could you trust?
All these hoes out here scheming, it's like, who could you fuck?
In this Rolls I be leanin' 'em like who gives a fuck?
'Bout these niggas talkin' reckless
Just know that you can be touched
When that money on the line, my youngins on the line
I'll put this money on your heads
'Cause all this money on my mind, nigga
And you don't wanna see me shine
Nigga, time is money, so I put some money on my time, nigga
I know you hear me on your radio
Fuck around, headshots'll spill that boy's Spaghetti-Os
And all my niggas tell me though
Dreamchaser, Hustle Gang, nigga, you already know

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey girl, my youngin want that chain
He run up with that thing
Even if he don't let it bang, I bet you won't do a thing
You ain't ballin like I'm ballin, I guess you don't do your thing
I'm a mill' a movie, man, broker deals, doin' things
Hustle Gang ma'fucka, all we do is get money
I got 100 racks, you wanna do some shit for me?
But That crew on your back, Hustle Gang on your chest
Make dope music but got other shit to do in the rear
You got a bitch, she see me gentle, I be usually fresh
Retarded watch on my arm, stupid shit on my neck
We both fuck her, let's help her, go ask her who do it the best
I pull this shit out her pussy, she still could feel it in her chest
Who get most of the money? Who got all the respect?
Head light, we get the best, let them fight for the rest
I beat you all in the ride, if I'm flyin' in a jet
In my 'hood you need a chopper, might get by with a TEK
You hear me?

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]

[Intro: Ashford & Simpson and DMX]
And for love's sake, each mistake Oh, you forgave
And soon both of us learn to trust
Not run away, it was no time to play
We build it up, we build it up, we build it up (You know!)
And now it's—

[Verse 1: DMX]
Solid, solid, dog is wildin'
Beat the shit out of money, took this wallet
Shoulda heard when he hollered: Aah, please help me!
Somebody stop him, 'cause this ain't healthy
From the dog, pop cross over joint
I pop niggas and they cross over, get the point
I was going through something, wrong was right
But couldn't wait to get out the gate to start a fight
Even if I'm wrong, I'm right and it's on, I might
Go hard, but man, it's gon' be a long night!
But fuck what you heard, it's gonna be alright

When we live by the buck, we get for the family

One day I wanna be a star
So I get to hang in a bar
I'll go to Vegas with the playas
Just to forget my scars
Ek, do, teen, char, panch, cheh, saath

Dedication 3

[v1]
Just a pause and
Nothing more
Just a second
To count the moments we've been waiting for

[Bridge]
Will you go quietly
Or put up a fight
Will you inspire me
Or deny...

[Chorus]
We're running from the unknown
What do we know?
We don't know
Where are we going
All we know is that yesterday
We were alive full of life
And now we're going, going down

[v2]
Just light that we'll
We'll ignite
So small and slight
It is what we've all been waiting for

[Bridge]
Will you go quietly
Or put up a fight
Will you inspire me
Or deny...

[Chorus]
We're running from the unknown
What do we know?
We don't know
Where are we going
All we know is that yesterday
We were alive full of life
And now we're going, going down
We're going down

[Bridge]
Will you go quietly
Or put up a fight
Will you inspire me
Or deny...

[Chorus]
We're running from the unknown
(This is all we know)
What do we know?
(This is all we know)
We don't know
Where are we going
(This is all we know)
All we know is that yesterday
(This is all we know)
We were alive full of life
And now we're going, going down
We're going down
We're going down
We're going down

[Verse 1: Usher]
Oh, for you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for you
For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

[Chorus: Usher]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody to love

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Every day, I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime (Last dime)
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

[Chorus: Usher & (Justin Bieber)]
I just need somebody to love (Oh no no, no no)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else

[Bridge: Usher with Justin Bieber]
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, girl
But what I really want, I can't find
'Cause money can't find me
Somebody to love
Find me somebody to love, oh

[Chorus: Usher]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else

I was sitting safely, across the road
From a rusting scaffolding, picking my nose
When a bird spoke up from high on that dark neon
He said, "I bet theres some things that you should come clean of"
Ohhhh I didn’t know
Ohh where to begin
Like you dont not know
Ohh I set the emotion
I was beating up babies, babies I mean
That don’t look like babies, but they’re babies to me
I was looking around for my very own best friend
Couldn’t help feeling things would come to an end
I always let you go
And then you let me back in
This is a status quo
Oh nobody wins
I was feeling sorry
So sorry for myself
I was trying to take it easy, but that wasn’t helping
Birds spoke up, this time I think it was a dove
He said I bet theres some things that you should come clean of
Ohhh that’s so its so
Oh you look through my skin
Ohhh how did he know
Oh and what was he in
Keep fooling myself
I keep fooling myself
I keep fooling myself
I keep fooling myself
I might need your help
I keep fooling myself
I might need your help
I can't just keep fooling myself
I oughta let you go
Hun you let me back in
It’s the status quo
Nobody wins
Ohhhh!
Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, oh how lovely

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love

I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love

I stop and stare at patterns
I don't care, I must declare
I've got a flair for patterns

On my hair, the clothes I wear
My savoir faire is patterns
All I see is patterns
The patterns that repeat

Let's go into the bathroom
I know we're in a room where you would not expect much math
Usually you're in here for a shower or a bath
But if you gaze upon the floor, and if you're kinda smart
You'll see the repetition is like geometric art

Wow, haha
Look

Everywhere, I see them there
I stop and stare at patterns
I don't care, I must declare
I've got a flair for patterns
On my hair, the clothes I wear
My savoir faire is patterns
All I see is patterns
The patterns that repeat

Hey!

A polkameister like myself never has to be bored
I just grab my ax and play some patterns on my keyboard
Now's the time for earplugs if you care about your health
So stand back, everybody, I'm gonna express myself

Look at this, patterns
I've got blisters on my fingers
Woo, hey, aw, get down
Yeah, help me, somebody, woo

Still there? Okay

Next time you find yourself at an exciting polka party
You can make some patterns with your feet and with your body
If you don't know the steps yet, here's the gang with all the answers
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing, the "Weird Al" Polka Dancers

Here they are
Everywhere, we see them there
We stop and stare at patterns
We don't care, we must declare
We've got a flair for patterns

On our hair, the clothes we wear
Our savoir faire is patterns
All we see is patterns
The patterns that repeat

Wallpaper, skyscrapers, funny papers, patterns
Evergreens, nouvelle cuisine, human beings, patterns
Garden rakes, wedding cakes, rattlesnakes, patterns
Golden wheat, little feet, my heartbeat

I gotta stop

Patterns, patterns, patterns, patterns

No I'm not a scholar

Only fuck with models
If she ain't dead fine than there ain't no need to holler
Yeah, I'm a baller
My swag through the roof
And your girlfriend is the truth
We got a room at the Ramada
She don't want to be bothered
You callin' like a father
You actin' like a toddler
You need a role model
I'm Polo with the Prada
I'm balling on you niggas like a Harlem Globetrotter
I'm walking with a waddle
You make believe niggas Harry Potter
Amigo friends might recommend the whole enchilada
Your girlfriend is a quitter
You should spit or you saliva
I'm Gucci Mane the mobster
Not a jocker, not a blogger

[Chorus: V Nasty]
Why we gotta kill shit?
Me and Gucci talking real shit
Cars on top of cars I'ma call it whip appeal, bitch
Whip appeal, bitch

Cars on top of cars I'ma call it whip appeal, bitch

[Verse 2: V Nasty]
Gucci let's get 'em
Got that AR chopper
Come through the front door
Left them at the doctor
Now we up a hundred more bands, that's proper
No need for a preacher
Pray to me, I'll be your father
Hide the young ones cause I'm coming for your daughter
If you ain't selling pussy, I ain't gon' bother
Got a pornstar, a ho, and a model
In the club we do big shit
Pop a hundred bottles
We gettin' hoes wet
They gon' need goggles
They said get that gas
So I'm on that full throttle
If I had a dick, than I'd tell that bitch to swallow
Thirty in my clip and I'm letting out hallows

[Chorus: V Nasty]
Why we gotta kill shit?
Me and Gucci talking real shit
Cars on top of cars I'ma call it whip appeal, bitch
Whip appeal, bitch
Whip appeal, bitch
Cars on top of cars I'ma call it whip appeal, bitch

LA Raiders

Making love to the money
Oh I'm so passionate
Hood stripes, Chuck Taylors, low khakis
Scraping in that new V looking V-Nasty
Selling snow in the winter I ain't cold yet
That's why I'm an OG and I ain't Old yet
South Central Murder Dubs, Killer California
Bend the wrong corner
You'll be sicker than pneumonia
Police told me to freeze
And my watch to chill
Whip the work into a SLS
Whip Appeal
Powder so fresh, I had to break the seal
96 and Wall Street
Shit gets real

[Chorus]

[Verse: 2-D]
2-D feelin' down to the camera's vibe
You just have to go 'cause you don't know what
I know you feel the stress, just appealing to be
And you don't get over counted 'cause it's down out on me
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
The devil killed this town 'cause I'm never home
And on and on it breaks 'til they fall asleep
My dreams, they got her kissin', 'cause I don't get sleep, no

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Everybody got their style
And thoughts of downin' makes me mad
Windmill, windmill, tell the sound
I'm aching for the ground

[Verse: 2-D]
2-D feelin' down to the camera's vibe
You just have to go 'cause you don't know what
I know you feel the stress, just appealing to be
And you don't get over counted 'cause it's down out on me
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
The devil killed this town 'cause I'm never home
And on and on it breaks 'til they fall asleep
My dreams, they got her kissin', 'cause I don't get sleep, no

[Outro: 2-D]

Go on your way with the cloudless blue sky above
May all your days be a wonderful song of love
Open your arms and sing of all the hidden hopes you'll ever treasure
And live out your life in peace

Where shall I look for the love to replace you
Someone to light up my life
Someone with strange little ways
Eyes like a blue autumn haze
Someone with your laughing style
And a smile that I know will keep haunting me endlessly

Sometimes in stars or the swift flight of seabirds
I catch a moment of you
Thats why I walk all alone
Searching for something unknown
Searching for something or someone to light up my life

[Verse 1]
Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father—he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."

[Chorus]
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Verse 2]
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are."

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father—he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away."
When I was just a kid I heard him say
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."

[Chorus]
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Outro]
These are the nights that never die
My father told me
Hey
(I want a soldier)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impala's around
(I got a soldier)
With the top down, feeling the sounds

Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs, ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shoot it with Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be G's you way outta your league, please

We like them boys that be in them 'Lac's leanin'
(Leanin')
Open their mouth, their grill gleamin'

A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street

We like them boys up top from the B.K
(b.k.)
Know how to flip that money three ways
(Three ways)
Always ridin' big on the freeway
(Freeway)
With that East Coast slang that us country girls be like
Low cut caesars with the deep waves
(Deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyonce
(Beyonce)
Always comin' down poppin' our way
(Our way)
Tellin' us that country girls the kinda girl they like

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean

If his status ain't hood I ain't checkin' for him

Hey, see, Cash Money is a army

You talkin' to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem

Call him, Weezy F. Baby, please say the Baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryin' to hide
I blend in with the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandanna tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute

I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight
(Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight

Homey in the Dickies in my zone tonight

I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, that my place is there
And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, I will lie in the shadow of
A palm that's no longer there, and pick a flower that doesn't grow
And maybe someone's love will speak the night
The lonely unwanted light that may bring me through the new day
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, they won't be in vain
All the plans I made to deceive myself, all the rose I made just to lose myself
All the love I made to forget myself, those mistakes I made just to find myself
I'll go back, I know now that I'll go back, that my place is there
And there it will always be, there where I can hear the Song of the Sabia
Of the Sabia
After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this (fiesta)
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest side
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsche's
Boxes with Glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' 'til six in the mornin'
In the back of the club with ma-ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'm a be drinkin' 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fuckin ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things only cause I
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fuckin' wit arenas
Gotcha man sayin' "Kelly have you seen her?"

Gettin' high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
Fiesta, fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta
Fiesta, fiesta

Switchin' lanes in my Six, in the 'burbs

Took the hood then I moved it, to the 'burbs
Now no more sheriffs or polices, in the 'burbs (that's right)
And we about to tear this club up
Don't worry 'bout expenses cause I got that sho' 'nough
Ready to BOO like I'm fresh outta jizzail

You know, take the edge off, you know what I'm sayin'?

[are. Kelly]
All my s*** ladies throw ya hands up high
And all my real playas throw ya hands up high
And just keep on bouncin' while I take you on a ride

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
It's like your body's on radio I'm feelin' you in stereo
Put me in your cd player I'm gonna hit it nice and slow
Baby I'm your hot mix bumpin' in your cherry Lex
Checkin' out your widescreen while your hands up on the headrest

[Verse 1: are. Kelly]
I'm, in the studio thinkin' about my next hit song
Tryin' to come up with a melody that will turn you on
On the mpc3000 tryin' to come up with beats
That'll make come on over here and lay down here with me
I'm searchin' for that special mind blowin' melody
And it's gotta be s*** so I'll think it through carefully
It's like I'm tryin' to tune it, to ya station babe
Try to get you to play, this record babe
Every time I hear this track girl I think about me and you
In the Maybach doin' what we do

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2: are. Kelly]
Um, now I know a few friends of mine that has made love to this record
So when you're in the mood call the station, request this record
She walks in the room, says "'Ly I can't breathe"
As I try to catch my breath and proceed
Lookin' at yo' s*** smile, while I put my vocals down
Girl you have made this song a hit in each and every town
You a s*** melody with a touch of freakin' harmony
Such a perfect chemistry
Girl we deserve a Grammy, or Soul Train
Billboard, mtv or bet award
Rollin' like we on a tour
Ooh the way you put it down girl I can't take it
S** was so good girl we've got to do the remix
'Cause girl you a mix master
When it comes to pumpin' you such a ghetto blaster
It's such a hit that I gotta bootleg it, yeah

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
A melody is the chemistry, the way we click
It's like four part harmony and all that shit
Your waistline is the bassline, I ride that shit
Strung off your treble and I'm high as shit
We made love in the studio when we got together over and over again like a loop
Damn I'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]

Aw yeah, aw yeah, yeah

Forget the comments that they made, we just some young niggas getting paid

And these days at red carpets I let my jewellery bling
Stand for some fuck nigga fall for anything
And everyday I hit the block and I make it rain
No, literally bruh I make it rain
Watch the throne mother fucker I'm the last king
Young Soulja Boy came in tag team
Shouts out Lil' B this the new shit
Swag took over the rap game bitch I knew it

Collateral damage when the head hit the mind sight
It's Lil' Dre outta sight nigga outta mind
So I'mma spit the same shit like 20 times
Lil' Dre came in the building to kill and I'm willing
To stack about 30 million
And if you don't believe Google it and see yourself

Welcome to my city I can show you how I get I done gave you your time to shine

Standing in the VIP so I see everybody trying to see a king

And when she drop it down on down on down on down and pop it…

Snapback on my head with a S on my chest

Young Dre flash bash digital dash in the club with all that cash
Still on deck getting money yeah you know wassup

Every single time I drop it's a hit in the summer
No droughts over here, we getting to the cake
Hopped up out the bed with the cash in the safe
Money on deck man nobody's safe

Girls going crazy when I'm on the scene
Racks on the way, busting out them jeans

Hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene

House up on the hill, got it off of cocaine

You rat, you'll sing a symphony and I'm back, city been missing me
My watch silly my clock ignorant and I'm the king of my city
I'm banned up and I ain't in a band
But my flow just like an instrument
Bass, feel that, yellow tape of the trizack
Hating is a disease, pussy where they do that?
L.A. Reid cut the check for me
King shit and you know what it is
Shawty smell like a pound of that loud, but a nigga look like a hundred mill
But I drive Ferrari, fuck the motherfuckin dealer
Pay 10 million for a mansion, that worth more than your opinion
I got racks all in my cargo pants
Standard clip with that hollow man, yo' bitch ass
If yo bitch bad, she get fucked fast, ain't no romance
My diamond dancing in 3D nigga
Like a bank strip when you see me, nigga
Your money wrong and my money long
And I'm playing with it like PE nigga
Real nigga no joke, don't think there nigga no ho
I got mini Mac-10 and a 100 round drum
In the carpet up under my car
And nigga I don't wanna smoke your weed, plain gas the only thing I smoke
And I gotta thank God for the niggas off Bankhead
Shawty, they taught me everything I know
Like how to whip it, cook it, cut it, deal it
Hand it to your partner let him flood through the city
Really, we bout that action, you try us and we blastin'
We turnt to the max that's a motherfucking fact
I'm a real nigga, fuck these rappers

Door up, doors down
When I'm in the club, bitch it's going down
Shawty think it fucked, hand down, hands up, pants down
Down, down, shawty fuckin head down
I see my phone blowing up, I know it's going down
Once I busted at the rapper, then it hit the town
Check the numbers in the city, boy it going down
This that dope boy academy, them three letters been after me, (Who?)
The F.B.I. ever catchin me, my family my witness a tragedy
Shorty open her legs up happily
I ball hard like an athlete
Young black nigga in a big white phantom
Nigga, I look like a referee nigga
They blowing the whistle they telling
I do the clam I'm chilling
This bitch turned up making rain
When I'm in the club you yellin
They talk about these Bentley's that I'm gettin on the daily
One feet in the game and one feet out, swear I barely made it
I'm a real nigga till the death of me
Never sing a song like a parakeet
50 bandz in my pocket just blew 60 grand on that Cherokee
I be gettin money like a motherfuckin Brinks trunk
Standing in the kitchen, nigga, trying to build a brick up, uh!

[Intro]
Alright, damn it, now this one's it, no more stoppin'
Finito, yes, that's what I'm talkin' about
Alright, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
If I was your woman and you were my man
You'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength to walk through that door
My love would overrule my sense and I'd call you back for more

[Chorus]
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man

[Verse 2]
She tears you down, darling, says you're nothing at all
I'll pick you up, darling, when she lets you fall
You're like a diamond, but she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you, for me you don't ask

[Chorus]
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man

[Verse 3]
Life is so crazy and love is unkind
Since she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me and you don't even know it
'Cause I'm what you need, but I'm too afraid to show it

[Chorus]
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man

[Outro]
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman and you were my man
If I was your woman

Dear God, bring our P-O-Ws home
And our brothers on lockdown, home
Amen!!!

[Jay-Z]
Jeah!!! Back blocked on everybody laptop
(Hov) Hittin' niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
(Kell) Oh yeah da niggas is comin' get out ya good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving

[are Kelly]
Whatever happen Lord, don't pass me by
Cause whenever I did wrong it was ya name I cried
I heard you forgave over and over again
But when I found out I love you, you became ammune to my sins
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep (I see dead people)
And sometimes it's me Lord
I never wanted to be a thug father
I only wanted to be a son of a father
That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I
I gave up da weed and somehow I'm still high
Three years still seein' them three guys Lord (Whoo)
Sometimes I don't know what you want from me, but I do know you know what I want from you
(Give it to me)
(Come on) Take away this Hennessey, take away me runnin' da streets
Stop people from rapin' me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy
Lord you said it was better place, I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes and project gates
Its hard to believe in what I can't see
I got to get this money and feed my family

[Jay-Z]
Whatever in me guides my life, dear Lord don't Let Me Die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, what shall I say
Its been a good run from hoodlum to outin' da states
How could one who made so much foul mistakes, still be allowed to have a smile on my face
How whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of
From a nickel plated burner
Now my life straight like a perm, tried to take da spot I earn
Muthafucka better learn

[Chorus:]
(Its hov) Back blocked on everybody laptop
(Kell) Hit niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
(Hov) Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving
(Kell) And non other than da "R" and without further a due like Freddy get ready

[are Kelly]
Lord hear me out, got a few more things to say
These demons be chasin' me like everyday (Come here)
Nah my life on crutches, never say I never walk again
But da devil is a lie cause I believe within'
You're da reason that I'm still here, even though I don't act like it
Even though I hear my callin' and fight it
Fools do me so wrong, it's hard to stay righteous
Pimpin was allowed to happen I'll hide it
Believe me Lord I want you, got money and fame but still it just won't do
Sometimes I don't like who I am, when I look in da mirror my reflection is Uncle Sam (Uncle Sam)
And every night I have these weird dreams, that a preacher trapped inside of me wake up and can't
Breathe
I feel like it's twenty of me, goin' twenty different directions on a one way street Lord
I got houses, money and cars, and met every single superstar
I got da whole music industry sold, but it still don't matter.......

[are Kelly & Jay-Z]
When I'm gone and my casket closed!!!

[Jay-Z]
Whatever in me guides my life, dear Lord don't Let Me Die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate
I did what I did my heart was in da right place (Ohhh)
I guess so I can live it put food on my plate
You must still love me not to let it in by three that day
Well whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of
From a nickel plated burner
I guess I'm not finished wit my journey, please forgive me for my sins
Shit I'm still tryna learn me

[Chorus:]
(Hov) From da back block on everybody laptop
(Kell) Hit niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British was comin'
(Hov) Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving
(Kell) And non other than da "R" and without further a due like Freddy get ready

[Bridge:]

[(are Kelly) Jay-Z]
Many men (Whoo) have come and gone in these streets (Feel Me)
Walked alone in these streets (Ohhh) waitin' to hear from you (Come on Lord)
Oh Lord,(Whoo)wrap your arms (Wrap your arms around us God)around da hood
(Lift every peace from war, bring our soldiers home, Let us pray)

[Verse 1]
It feels like you don’t need me anymore
I used to be the answer and the cure
I used to be the life you thought for sure
And oh you're sure on me now

[Pre-Chorus]
And even though the sun is shining
The raging fires are slowly dying
The walls have got me rattling my cage

[Chorus]
Oh, look at me, look at me
Look at me, just look at me again
Oh, look at me, set me free
Look at me, just look at me again

[Verse 2]
I thought you would protect me from the loneliness and shame
But now I see it's part of who I was and who I am
And you being gone reminds me of nobody being there
Oh, I'm sure of you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And even though your eyes are shining
I can't stop my own from crying
I can't stop what's running through my head

[Chorus]
Oh, look at me, look at me
Look at me, just look at me again
Look at me, set me free
Look at me, just look at me again
Ooh, ooh, again

[Bridge]
Girl, you don't have to worry, I won't get in your way
Girl, you don't have to worry, I won't get in your way
I just wanna be with you, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna be next to you every morning
Oh (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Alright now, baby (Da-da-da-da)
Oh (Da-da-da-da-da)
Ooh, ooh (Da-da-da-da-da)

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you look into my eyes, will you see everything I hide?
And if I've changed or am I still the same?

[Chorus]
Oh, look at me, look at me
Look at me, just look at me again

[Outro]
Look at me (Look at me), save me (Save me)
Set me free (Set me free), look at me
Set me free again, oh, oh
Look at me (Look at me), save me (Save me)
Set me free (Set me free), oh
Look at me, baby, again
(Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
(Da-da-da, da-da-da-da) Ooh, ooh
(Da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Girl, I wanna be with you, I just wanna hold you
Wanna be with you in the morning
I miss you
Oh, I miss you so much, baby
Oh, yes, I do
Oh (Da-da-da-da-da)
I miss you so much, baby
"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said a joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion, I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None with a level on the vine
Nobody out of it is worth, hey
"No reason to get excited", the thief he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate, so let us stop talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"
All along the watchtower, princess kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance, a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl
(Bridge)
Every day I’m all about that dollar bill hoe
That R E S P E C T I kill for
Lost a hundred grand, made a hundred mill though
My money long, your money short, back out so stand up

(Hook)

Say I ain’t getting it, who told done told the lie?

(Verse)
Say girl stand, stakin, I can hit a mill
Playin hay, getting on my ass, I don’t give a fuck
We talkin paper, hood is up, we get them figures up
The order I’m payin for, I hit them niggas up
Triple OG, they can sit around
Slurp green like nigga you a sitting duck
I park a drive, you suck a dick then I’m still bonified
GDOD, you know me homie, know I’m gonna ride

Some say I’m snitchin, pussy nigga, who you talkin bout?
Fuck nigga, we can have a paper work party
But she ain’t got no patience, Shawty do that work for me

(Verse)
I’m about that paper, I’mma get that til I die

They say we ain’t getting money, they don’t motherfuckin lie
I’m like shittin rich, we getting karats by the pound
We ain’t countin that so we gonna be countin for a while
Cut through it when I shoot
Now they through it in the top
‘Cause everybody came through
Shawty take they ball
Get dough or die, they where you need it ho
Though how the streets talkin you a dead man walkin
And I just bought a Louie belt to hold that 40
If you play emotion to the death with that big ol 40
For real, I’m preachin out in Ogeeda
Don’t talk about yo real, boy I’m walkin on the real
Any boogers in my ear cost me brick fair
All white BBS’s look like fish scale

I’m all about my paper, bustin for my cheddar
The reason why you broke ‘cause you don’t know no better
You not talkin money I can’t see yo visions
All I do is getting money, that my true religion
I will bust it down, pass when you were washin dishes
You was workin for the man, now we’re still up in it
We ain’t ghosts in the ghost, nothing is rented
I don’t even know the price, bitch I just spin it
You see them Forgiato bitch, I pull em on the curb
If she’s not a bad bitch she getting no swerve
Can’t even swing a rack, no sir
I’m a selling digit nigga, like a phone long bird

Verse 1
Pretty open eyes
They fill me up surprisingly
With a hope i'll find
A place to sleep so soundly
Dreams are disguised
As a meaning we should follow
How hard we try
To hold onto ourselves
And not to let go
Chorus
We could call this life
We could call this everything we know
We could say we tried
We could let them say
I told you so
But we'll take this life
And we'll make it everything we know
Then we'll know we tried
Never let them say
I told you
Verse 2
Pretty open eyes
Open up to find just what they seek
When closed they dream
Of places way too far to reach
So find the truth
And you can set yourself free
And we can prove
The all we needed, was to believe
Chorus
We could call this life
We could call this everything we know
We could say we tried
We could let them say
I told you so
But we'll take this life
And we'll make it everything we know
Then we'll know we tried
Never let them say
I told you
Middle 8
I told you so seems to come around
More often than i'd like to hear it
Don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna hear it
So shut your mouth
Don't make a sound
Erase the doubt, that i am bound
That i am stopped by limits
Shut your mouth
Don't make sound
Erase the doubt, that i am bound
That i am stopped by limits
Chorus
We could call this life
We could call this everything we know
We could say we tried
We could let them say
I told you so
But we'll take this life
(pretty open eyes)
And we'll make it everything we know
Then we'll know we tried
(open up your eyes)
Never let them say
I told you so

[Verse 1]
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinkin' of the ways that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreamin' of the open
Waiting for the day
But he can spread his wings
And fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Let me wake up in the mornin' to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreamin' of the open
Waiting for the day
But he can spread his wings
And fly away again

[Chorus]
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very, so very far behind

[Intro]
And these days
And these days
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
If only my...

[Verse One]
I've these dreams of
Walking home
Home where it used to be
Everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me

Here I stand, six feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bittersweet feeling hearing No Such Thing on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

[Chorus]
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they were at the start of me
Had it made in '83

[Verse Two]
Thinking 'bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother John
But on an 18-month delay
He's a-okay, by the way

Here I stand, six feet small
And smiling cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actors' names have changed
Oh well

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

[Chorus]
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
I wish things would be more like they were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
Plot a course to the source of the purest little part of me

[Bridge]
And most my memories
Have escaped me or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of Bridgeport, CT, and 1983

You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards, replace the shutters
But that's my plastic in the dirt

Whatever happened to my, whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?

[Insert - Girls Just Want To Have Fun]
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father says, What you gonna do with your life?
Oh Daddy dear, you know, you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have, oh no, no, no, no
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, girls, let's hear it for the boys
Let's hear it for my baby
Let's hear it for the boys
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Oh, oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving, one-man show
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If my life was more like '83
This is my mother fucking house, eh I'm by the front door

She'll do anything for daddy man the bitch go
Tell 'em what the doormat read baby big blow

Uh Pyrex and a digi scale
Fuck gloves I got yay all in my fingernails
And I can leave a set of white fingerprints
Chris Tucker, Laurence Tate, Dead Presidents
Dead white boys spread across the coffee table
Don't know maybe I'll start me up a record label
Fuck it get high and call what's her name
She like to play this little game called fuck a brain
Lord when you talk them numbers sound sophisticated
It ain't nothing even the pitbull's affiliated

G shit even the coupes got Chucks on

Yeah
This is my mother fuckin' house nigga
This is where I do it at
You gotta problem with that
Yeah big dog nigga
If you ain't a big dog stay on the porch nigga
Dog house or nothing
Dog house everything nigga
I got a whole house trap house and a flat
I'm on parole bitch so I need my pistol back
These rap niggas is too soft
I built this from the ground up pound up
Until I knock your roof off

New boss Snoop off and on and
Heed him in the morning catch him while he yawnin'
My bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in
Cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential
Strip for your credentials

Mental unessential shits official like a referee with a whistle
Nah my nigga shits official like a jihad Muslim with a missile
Catch me in the air we close to the nickel block
Nigga went platinum but I still serve that nickel rock
Hard times bad times fuck doing jail time
Cook it up rock it up bag it up and sell mine

This my mother fuckin' house
Take your mother fuckin' shoes off when you step in my house partner
Matter of fact take your hat off too
Nigga this the round table nigga
If you can't stand the heat get your punk ass up out the kitchen
I'm in this mother fuckin'
This is my house in the middle of the trap
I'm gonna start sweating like I ran a fucking lap
Customers on hold stressing they keep coming back
Three, six, five, two, four, seven, I got Jumbo Jacks
Would you like your cheese with that
Yeah I like my cheese with that
Crack in the box round the clock
Open all night pitching rocks
Serving that goop stuck in my loop
Pitching that tragic all in the traffic
Me and my group me and my cabinet
Goobly goop, goobly bag it

I got the key to this spot break in you don't get popped
Fuck around and get molly whopped in here better not attract no cops
Gotta hang around chop up in here who want what I got in stock
Not from Atlanta but I got heart
Chickens birdies quails baking soda scales
Heavy weights exhale 5 star hotels
I'm a grinder about my grit
Trying to increase my profit quick
50 thou under the couch
This is my mother fucking house

This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house
This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house

This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking this is my fucking house

This is my mother fucking this is my mother fucking
This is my mother fucking fucking fucking house
Which of you schnooks took my rhyme book?
Look give it back, you're wicky wack
With your ticky tack calls, didn't touch you at all
I didn't touch your hand man, you know its all ball
You sold a few records, but don't get slick
'Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
You've been in the game, your career is long
But when you break it down, you've only got two songs
MC's are like clay pigeons and I'm shootin' skeet
I just yell pull and MMM drops the beat
You people call yourselves MC's, but you're garbage men
Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
Come on in, now I read about you up on page six
They was trashin' your ass, it's sad you're getting dissed
Now talk about your face, now don't get pissed
But I suggest you see a dermatologist
I keep that hot sauce hot, not mild and weak
It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
'Cause I've got more rhymes, than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks
Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch
You're hearing me and you're like "Oh my god its Sasquatch!"
I'm walkin' on water, while you're stepping in shit
So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
Sucker MC's it's me they're resenting
In the animal kingdom they call it presenting
With the dipsy doodle the kit and caboodle
The truth is brutal your grandma's kugel
Kings County is my stomping ground
The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown
So don't ask me to wine and dine ya
I'm from Brooklyn you're from Regina
You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam
You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am?
With those lies you're telling you look like Toucan Sam
But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
What a loser

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Lift off, take flight
I'm living the life
Racing down the boulevard
Under the Vegas lights
Ooh, oh, oh, mmm
What a wonderful feeling
I got my hands up to the ceiling
Singing, ooh, oh, oh, oh, mmm
Got my hands up in the air
Where we end up, I don't care

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, Bobby Womack
Oh yeah, Vegas nights, Vegas nights
Oh yeah, Vegas nights, Vegas nights

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
I really don't know what I'd do without you, babe
You flip the switch and then I'm on, all night long
And you know I can't sleep without you, babe
'Cause even in the city of lights, I still can't see
But I feel 20-20 when you're with me

[Pre-Chorus: The-Dream]
I'm in love with you
You're my everything
Wanna be your forever
Baby, not just lightning
There's a storm of love that stays, never goes
I'm gonna bottle your light
And then shoot, baby, right

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, Bobby Womack
Oh yeah, Vegas nights
Gimme that, gimme that Vegas nights
Oh yeah, Vegas nights
Gimme that, gimme that Vegas nights

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I'm out for the night
We'll keep it going until the sun comes up
We gon' sing and we gon' dance
Shut it down tonight

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, Bobby Womack
Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, Bobby Womack
Oh yeah
I think I gave him a discrete name; he replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game, no ball, repeat game
He addicted to hustle; I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chilling, make a hell of a killing
Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leaving the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, enough said, pull off in that thing, and it's blush red

Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down

Of our sex in the lounge

So caught up in this girl

Keeping true to myself, cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around
And when we doing it, I can hear her make a sound
Shawty was singing like me
Had that girl singing, singing like me
She be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh why
She looking at me like she want it

I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why

Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I-I dig, I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sex in the lounge

Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down

Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl

On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time
I'm far with this shit, it's a lot going on at the same damn time
Right about now
I put that on my bra, nigga this ain't nothin' new to me
Rollie on my wrist, designer shoes and a Gucci treat
Supermodel bitches and they frizz all in my bathroom'd up
Team money said they like 'er, I said fuck it then I'm passin' up
Got money to blow, I get it like I print it all
A million at the show, ain't no way that I could spend it all
Monday I be all up in my Lambo, cross me pocket chips
Tuesday pull the Rrari up, say I'm on some floss 'n' shit
Wednesday I'm confused, I don't know which car to head on with
I want something new, I'm about to buy some other shit
But I don't know which car to go in yea
I said fuck it, went and bought a lil' jet
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time
I'm back up on my gunner shit, I fuck the bitch you comin' with
No squares in my circle, not the niggas that I haller with
God no, make no noise when I bust cause I muzzle it
1500 mill on the reel I'm tryna double it
Fuck 'em with my diamond shine, fresh up off that diamond mine
Niggas come and get you like they propin' up in columbine
Columbine, propin' up in columbine
You don't want no problem, where I'm from they do this all the time
And you don't wanna gamble with your life
Like the chalk up on that sidewalk, my whips are all white
Crib is all white and that jewelry so bright
Multitask with this pimpin', we could do this all night
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time

On the sofa, poppin' bottles at the same damn time
Fresh pack of Boga Mills
Empty bottle of Azteca
Empty bottles of Nuvo
Only one problem is

Bitch tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
I kicked her out my bed

Okay, we left the club around 3
Headed back to that room
Yea, it's time for that dome
'Cause we checkin' out 'round noon
She said damn N.O.R.E. so cold
Keep it up, always no doors
Look at that ass, shorty on swol'
We could just go go go go
How bout some back shots?
Do it missionary
Whip out my laptop, pulled out my dictionary
And I got head right off the whip
Then she came out up my lips
I'm like bitch what part is this?
Bitch tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
I kicked her out my bed

Still gettin' head all in that whip
Without crashing that shit
You see me passing some Crys
You know I'm smashing that bitch now listen
Last night I had a new ho with a Molly on and a Neuvo
She want to leave in my two door
She was on the D you know Cool Moe
Freaks come out at night
I see she 'bout that life
Feed that bitch that pipe
Skeet skeet like more than twice
I'm getting head like once again and she came up out my lips
That's one part I'm just not with bitch tried

Bitch tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
I kicked her out my bed
I had to tell her, I had to tell her, I had to tell her man
I said baby girl, mamita senorita
We could've did what we did, what we're supposed to do
But after you did what you did, eww

Bitch tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
Fuck wrong with your head?
She tried to kiss me after head
I kicked her out my bed

[AIDA]
You know nothing about me and care even less
How could you understand our emptiness?
You've plundered our wisdom, our knowledge, our wealth
In bleeding us dry, you long for our spirit
But that, you will never possess

The past is now another land, far beyond my reach
Invaded by insidious foreign bodies, foreign speech
Where timeless joys of childhood lie broken on the beach

The present is an empty space between the good and bad
A moment's leading nowhere, too pointless to be sad
But time enough to lay to waste every certainty I had

The future is a barren world from which I can't return
Both heartless and material its wretched spoils, not my concern
Shining like an evil sun as my childhood treasures burn
Shining like an evil sun as my childhood treasures burn
I don't know just how it happened, I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
I wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing though my veins
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
Midnight blows in through the window; dances round the room
Got me hypnotized; I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!
R.I.P it's the remix killer
Mike Jack was alive, I'd remix Thriller
Trap star, bitch, spell it with a big T
Give a damn if I never be a hot MC
Cause I'm a hood nigga, first on everybody's list
Buy the whole club P, don't fuck with no Cris
That average ass watch can't fuck with my wrist
Them average ass hoes can't fuck with my bitch
To the window, to the motherfuckin' wall
Enough money in my jeans to buy a motherfuckin' mall
Got the choppas in the back, bulletproof, that's my Hummer
R.I.P. to the competition, this is my summer
R.I.P I wanna kill the judge
Tryna lock the homie up, they don't feel the thug
I'm thirsty, but I don't give a fuck
Fuckin' with my ex cause I'm still in love
I can teach you how to fuck and how to stack money
I ain't went Hollywood, you just act funny
Girl I know you want this pipe like a crack bummy
Stop playin', I'm tryna hit like a crash dummy
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
I can't take yo bitch if I don't see yo bitch

No better yet coke to a snorter,we were like

Had to go and throw it all away,I hope it was worth it
Through with the hurting,girl its for certain..

Made me feel this way,never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore,baby its a shame to see,that being without
You ain't a thing to me,never thought it'd come a day that I,I don't
Love you anymore

[Verse 2:]
I never thought that tis would be,a one true fantasy,turned to a
Tragedy,but all in reality,it was you to be the cause of my doom

My brain,girl I just don't love you anymore,no

Made me feel this way,never thought it'd be a day that I

And im dancin with the stars, dancin by myself

My niggas stand right beside me, but your niggas up unda you

Gucci Mane La Flare im so tired of you
And if i had the time i would be sleepin too
But im workin these streets like a prostitute

They tell me rest up i say i leave the rest for you
Cause right now im chasin check's like a lawyer do
So dont bother me and i won't have to bother you
Im just out here chasin cash like a mobster fool

Now I could sit here and baffle you
With shallow babble
And a bunch of punch lines
You probably won't get
Or even use some big words
That you'd have to look up
But, I'm not a teacher
So go ahead and close your book up
I could tell a fairy tale so convincing
And keep a straight face from beginning
To happy ending
I could waste 32 bars telling you how to live
Knowing damn well I used mtv cribs for the blueprint
I could bore you to death with my past relationships
Or a little ditty bout Jack and Dianne
Or I could go back to childhood
Dig up them skeletons
And spit them at you with a catchy hook
Look, I could strike a nerve with some four letter words
That'll make Richard Pryor proud
Or better yet, I could sing a jingle that'll contort and mingle
Every single solitary letter in the alphabet
(I could tell you whatever you want to hear
But if I just said hello would you listen to me?
I could sell a blind man new ears
If I just said hello would you listen to me?
I'm trying hard trying to make it perfectly clear
But I'm dying because their ain't nobody listening to me
Been relying on myself on myself for more than 22 years
And I ain't crying I just need someone to listen to me
Can I get some reply get maybe some kind of sign
To let me know that you're listening to me?
Just from time to time I get lost in my mind
Its hard to find someone to listen to me
My ears were open when you needed some consoling
Now I'm hoping to hear something besides echos every time I say hello
I could talk about my duds
And my thrift store scores
But that probably wouldn't interest you
But why should it
I mean, I've seen a lot of shit in 22 years
But your feet in my shoes isn't something I recall
And I've been known to drink 22 beers
Before a show 'cause
Otherwise I probably wouldn't have the balls
I could make references to books I never read
For the sake of sounding conscious
But, that's just obnoxious
I could take off these bandages and
Expose these papercuts
And put them in the air
With both my middle fingers up
Or talk about myself in third person
Like I'm better than you
'cause there's nothing else better to do
I could attack your character from
Eighty different angles
Cleverly explaining exactly how wack you are
But why do that when it's a well known fact
You buying this cd is potentially feeding me
(come on)
(I could tell you whatever you want to hear
But if I just said hello would you listen to me?
I could sell a blind man new ears
If I just said hello would you listen to me?
I'm trying hard trying to make it perfectly clear
But I'm dying because their ain't nobody listening to me
Been relying on myself on myself for more than 22 years
And I ain't crying I just need someone to listen to me

To let me know that you're listening to me?
Just from time to time I get lost in my mind

Now I'm hoping to hear something besides echos every time I say hello
Hello, is there anybody out there?
Hello, is there anybody out there?
Hello, is there anybody out there?
Hello, is there anybody out there?
Hello, is there anybody out there?
A child of winter
A child of the snow
I'm making a snowball
That someone will throw
I'm making a snowman
With charcoal for the eyes
A scarf draped in red
And a derby on his head
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
The evening of Christmas
Presents have been passed
The wood in the fireplace
Is glowing its last
I'm closing my eyes now
In my bed I'm snuggling
Outside my window
The carolers sing
Christmas comes and the snow covers all
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread
The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed
A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
And may your Christmas
Last all year
With laughter of children
Peace and cheer
A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
Merry Christmas to you
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go

It took so long for you to get close to me
Now you wanna go run away girl, away from me
I know it's got to be hard, cause I'm so busy
Not to mention many lonely nights, just missing me

Cause there's nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side

It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go

It took some time for you to earn around your trust
I ain't going nowhere anytime soon you can put that on us
Gucci, Louie, Rodeo, we gon' live it up
Now you want to say goodbye girl, and go mess it all up
Cause there ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side

It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me and why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you want to leave me, why you wanna go

Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me (girl), forgive me
I love you, I love you, I love you (girl), (yes) I love you
My mom say, my pop say, the family, they all say
They love you, they love you, they love you, they love u

It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me and why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me and why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you want to go (tell me girl)
Why you want to leave me, why you wanna go

[Intro]
Yessir
Three
Ha, I love this shit
So let me talk my shit, uh-huh, haha
(Coughing)
Okay, I'm good
Yeah

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I know you see the guap, 'cause getting money is what we on
Riding drop-top in the winter with the heat on
Bad yellow bitch keep my passenger seat warm
Leg hanging out the window, you ain't got these on
Bitch, holler! It is Lil Weezy
They cannot see me, they are like Stevie
I am bearing a ton like Levy
I circle your house like BB
Colder than the heebie-jeebies, never give freebies
Seventy-five thousand for these fees, shit
I can get a hundred thousand up in these jeans
Big stacks, my pockets on Creatine
Young Money, DipSet, nigga, we a team
If you don't like it, nigga, fuck you, no Vaseline
Errr! I peel off in the Lamborghin'
Like a tangerine
Got the engine straight shaking like a tambourine
Like a bitch with some lips like Angeline, not Joli
Holy, God flow, I go where no other guy go
I go where no other guy go
Fuck you, ho, I'm so 5-0—
4, I hope every snitch die slow
Hip-hop, that's my ho, I know
She know I like it wet, don't want no dry ho
Alright, bitch, I am the boy, no decoy
And I will straight up destroy any boy, or man
And I prefer money than bitches, or just reefer
We are Young Money, bitch, and I am the leader
He are: Curren$y, Mack Maine, and D-Raw
And I just signed a chick named Nicki Minaj
You in the office of the good doc again, let's walk again
It's like clock again, the hood rock again
You should pop it in,ain't take it out
That shit play on, you can't make it out
The world ain't set for what I'm about to do
Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two
I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop
Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops

We can shoot, we can scrap
We can rap, we can act
We can mack these bitches, whatever you want
Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front

How it be on the West, forever the hunt

But I won't wear no bull's eye (Bull's eye eye)
Bull's eye is how these fools die (Die die)
Waitin' on school by (By by)
Have you on the news by (By)
Y'all know how the story goes
We give a fuck about award shows

Same shit about hoes

Real niggas own platinum balls
I ain't got it on my neck nigga check my walls
I think y'all just tryin' to insight us
Yo I see how the world can't see these Eastsidaz
All y'all wanna criticize, fuckin' with us tryin' to get a ride
That's when my shit flies

And here's where the pimp lies

I spit game at the globe
First week deuce five

[Chorus]
I'd rather be ridin' than walkin'
While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin'
All you high paid niggas stay fly
I'ma slide left, fly right on by
I'ma do it on the boulevard
Fast bitches, fast cars and stars
Stayin' boxed up eatin' caviar
Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah
It's funny how the game goes
New face but they look like the same hoes
I try to get away, everybody wanna hit of Dre
Stay focused, bang I done hit a day

Nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies
Niggas mad Dre and Snoop stayin' multi

My career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin'

You thinkin' California all sun and surf, for sho'
I can see you walkin' under the Earth

My gun burst em'

And I still got my first mil'
Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt

Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest
G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South
Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me

A word from me, exclusive as a surgery
But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin'

Like that
Whole staff'll come through and spin
Either on the film or the two-inch wheel
Behind the wheel of a sixty-four
I can't stop till I done fifty totes

Y'all motherfuckers know me
I smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like Kobe

[Chorus]

[Repeat x4]
Rock on, rock on keep movin' on
Groovin' on and hold ya on

[Chorus]

Laid back, feet up in the hammock, I'ma live for ya

I'ma floss 'til they toss me a Bed-Stuy parade
'Til Chi-Town make a nigga Mayor for a day
In the memory of Joanne Kelly, let us pray

[R] Both worlds... Welcome to the best of both worlds
Level on these palm trees
I wanna be cooler then a new cord
Pimping like we too short
Came o my side walk chilling like a true Lord
Dreaming in the hills, what you f**king on my Buford?
Popping up the floors at the K. town
But we ain't chasing nothing, no baby
Only roll real b**ches with the great soft
Hustle with the G-s and OG-s
One day will be on level with the poppin
Level from these palm trees
Level from these palm trees
I wanna be leaning down the town
Fading with the sunset, never tracing set
We are trick away from ?
Kicking it like fortress, sipping out the ?
Over look my portrait, kinda of gorgeous
Down with everybody like a local rebuilding
Since they dropping caley tose some pimped out and killer
Rage a G. drop and hustel, flipping G-s for OG-s
One day well be on level; with the palm trees
Inhale, exhale , banging with the angels, roll it with my head high
Falling from the tavern
On another level
On another level
Inhale, exhale , banging with the angels, roll it with my head high
Falling from the tavern
On another level
On another level
Level from these palm trees
Level from these palm trees
Level from these palm trees

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Up early, smokin' and plottin'
Looking at these lames being thankful I'm not them
This year couple million out the game
And you're wondering how I got them
I got it from going hard, I always stay on my job
Wanna get high you should come to my spot then
And smoke with some heavyweight niggas
Jets, Taylor Gang nigga losing's not a option
Now I'm always on the road
And everywhere I go people asking what I'm rocking
I tell em this is next year's fresh and this year's best
And some shit you niggas not in, so quit copyin'

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah man
You niggas got it confused, trying to do what we do
That's not the point
The point is for you to do you
It's a beautiful thing

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I'm in the regal, you in a rut
Stuck, can't come up
Old, jealous niggas hatin' on us
Bitches is wishin' you'd shut the fuck up
I'm in the position, set my niggas up tough
What the fuck, just jump
Continents I promise it
I could go from bucks to billions in a minute
Made a split second decision
Executed with precision
I feel attention when I walk in the room
Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin' they woman
Thinkin' I'mma walk up to 'em, but I don't do it
Baby girl know the big shit from the manure
I could help you shine like a jeweler
Candy paint make an old whip newer
From Brooklyn to LA
From Japan and even you Paris
You can have it
You can do whatever you want to do
It's alright, yes, it's alright
And it's ok
Cause trouble don't last away
You know sometimes it goes through such trouble
And we think that nobody, nobody care
It's gonna be alright and it's gonna be ok honey
Because the universe, yes, would let you go down too much
You know that you can feel good about yourself

Cause nobody else is gonna do it for you
So you got to make up your mind
That you're gonna get up and do what you want to happen
And that's all I'm sayin'
There is a winner in you, there is a greatness in you
There is somebody in you
That wants to come out and let you know that
You are somebody
Tou know what, you're gonns go higher, higher, higher
And it's alright you know
There is somebody in you
That wants to come out and let you know that
You are somebody
No man can take it away from you, because that's
Your gift that was given from God and you know what
It's gonna be ok
Because you know what, let that last tear fall
Because it's gonna be alright
You don't have to worry about them
And don't even think about them
No negativity or positivity
Bless your enemies that's all I can say
Because when you start blessing them
And say God bless them

And it's alright because it starts turning things around
And working it out in your favour
And you don't have to walk around with a proud on your face
And who you hat cause Mary says "no haterativity" right
So that means you have to love everybody
And when you start feeling the love covering up inside of you
Watch out because you know that all good things
Are going to be handed up to you

I believe

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinkin and partyin
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what ya heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second comin of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talkin...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (are. Kelly)]
Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, So Big is my inspiration, dig
No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I on the other hand relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave us life for some shit like this
Ma you rollin I'm as real as it gets

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinkin and partyin
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga fuck what ya heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second comin of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talkin......

[Verse 2: are. Kelly]
Big chips! I can't take this
The way you move your ass slow like Matrix
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas
Before I toss chips first, get naked
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot and comin, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken layin platinum ex-farmer (preach!)
So go low mama, give it a go
As I punch 170 on stretch roads, must turn up the radio!
Girl you so good I'm swervin like whoa! Whoa!
Uh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch
Out the stretch to the Hotel, into the hotel suite!

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinkin and partyin
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga fuck what ya heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second comin of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talkin......

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Big chips! I'm a boss I said
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread
And the pigeons start flockin, ballin like Bishop 

[?]
And stick Cochran on any da, to try to stop him
So any gunplay that is an option
I been doin this since niggas was woppin
Rockin Izods with the matchin socks, and
Slap boxin in the back park and when the girls start watchin
Try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it till I make it tight nigga ma I don't want ya number
Either you're comin or I one ya
Either you know what you want ma, I don't even want ya
You play pretty if you wanna

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinkin and partyin
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga fuck what ya heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second comin of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talkin... Big chips!

[Bridge: are. Kelly]
All around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spendin big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
You wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Say we goin around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spendin big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Do you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)

[Outro: are. Kelly]
Uh, come on, Tone, I see ya, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters
What's really good, we in the islands chillin in the shade and shit you know
Blue waters, yellow sand, uh
Either I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all y'all other... (look)
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or try to do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on!

[Verse 1: Usher]
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 2: Usher]
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Bridge]
I'm standing here
Where you ought to be
Got you mad at me cuz I got your lady
You ain't got to worry I ain't trying to romance
All I wanna do is make her dance with me

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
Black hair, it's swimming in my head
Black hair, it's bigger than death
Black hair, don't leave me in the dirt
Black hair, I'll show you what I'm worth

It's not what you are
It's just what you did
Don't hang up the phone
I love you to death

Eternal return
Eternal return

Black hair, it's swimming in my head
Black hair, it's bigger than death
Black hair is melting in the sun
Black hair, just look at what you've done

[Intro]
Baby baby, don't go, ooh
Don't, baby baby, don't, don't, don't, don't go

[Verse 1]
L.A. proved too much for the man
So he's leavin' the life that he's come to know, whoa-oh
He said he's goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago

[Chorus]
He's leaving (Leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Georgia, Georgia, Georgia
He said he's goin' back
(Going back to find)
To a simpler place and time
I've gotta be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
(My world is his, his and hers alone)

[Verse 2]
He kept dreamin', yeah
That someday he'd be a star
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true (No, no)
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold that old raggedy hoopty of a car
He bought a one way ticket
To the life he once knew

[Chorus]
He's leaving (Leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Oh, I love you, baby, I'm comin'
He said he's goin' back
(Going back to find)
To a simpler place and time
I've gotta be with him
Yeah, on that midnight train
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I gotta be on that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, I gotta be on that midnight, midnight
On the midnight, mid-mid-mid-mid-midnight train to Georgia
Yeah, Georgia
He's leaving
He's leaving on the midnight
On the midnight, mid-mid-mid-mid-midnight train to Georgia
Oh yeah
On the midnight, yeah, midnight, yeah yeah
Hold up, track one, I'm comin', yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, on the midnight, yeah, midnight

Go, gonna board, gonna board
Gonna board the midnight train
Gotta go, gonna board
Gonna board
Gonna board the midnight train
Hello Brooklyn!

[Chorus]
Hello Brooklyn how you doing
Where you going and can I come too
And if I can I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my car and drive me crazy
Wherever your going baby girl just take me
Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying baby I'm just saying

Like a mamma you birthed me, Brooklyn you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Burkley
They say you murked me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
Guess what I'ma call her, Brooklyn carter
When I left you for Virginia it didn't offend ya
Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much I bought extra
So much so that dinners now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hello Brooklyn

[Chorus]
Hello Brooklyn

Whats your story, she said she's eating on the run but she ain't Nore
She said she's got a man but he ain't worried
But baby I'ma have to rob him like Orie
She said she love B.I.G. and she likes Tupac
And when I said Jay-Z she said it's the Roc
I'ma leave it like this like this like that
Where Brooklyn at, where Brooklyn at
Have you seen her, and when she tell you something you better believe her
She told me she like my new Orleans demeanor
And so I said goodbye Katrina and hello Brooklyn

But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn

Brooklyn you crazy look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth walking 'round behaving
Or demented black hoodies and timberland'd
Always scheming you see the gleam on that niggas pendant
Hello Brooklyn, you bad influence
Look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you, look at my attitude it says my life's too real
Check out my ice grill baby I'm cold as ice
I come from Brownsville but my "beds in the 'stye"
Blow la la "flatten your bush" till we smoking c.i
What up to the boy d.i. you know I handle B.I
I don't half step on the 'caine, ask the dreads 'bout I
How you want it slow she like it hard cold
So I grind slow iller than out in square mall back in the 9-0
My fine hoe we got some victims to catch
So in a couple years baby I'ma bring you some next

[Chorus]
But baby you are the sweetest site eyes could see
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said hello Brooklyn, but baby you are so damn fine to me
And I remember the time, place and the weather from the day you said hi to me
And I say hello Brooklyn

One, two, three, four, five, Detroit
One, two, three, four, five, Detroit
One, two, three, four, five, Detroit
You have the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that upturned chin and the grin of impetuous youth
I believe in you, I believe in you
I hear the sound of good solid judgment whenever you talk
Yet there's that bold, brave, spring of the tiger that quickens your walk
I believe in you, I believe in you
And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart
I've but to feel your hand grasping mine, and I take heart
I take heart to see the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet there's that slam, bang, tang, reminiscent of gin and Vermouth
Now I believe in you, I believe in you
(musical interlude)
I believe in you, I believe in you, I believe, I believe in you

[Verse 1]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stay strong, yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Bridge]
Hmm, she gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention?
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 1]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the day and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna to be alright
People keep talking; they can say what they like
But all i know is everything's gonna to be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is falling down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around

You and me together
Through the days and nights

People keep talking; they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna to be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one, no one

To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So 'til the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling, baby
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you...
Who that, weezy bitch
Like Sigel, you fuckin' with the young don, people
Plus I'm tryna make a son, he gon' be the sequel
Muh'fuckas better be peaceful, fo' sheezle
I get sums in lumps, like measles
My dough sick, on occasions, I catch seizures
I treat beef like burgers, just cheese you
And for that cheddar, hungry niggas'll eat you
We breeze through in the twelve with the judo eyes
Bitches, yell I wanna do those guys
Ain't that cold, you know shit fucked up when you got banked at fo'
I'm nineteen and I got banked at O
That's the Bentley ma, that ain't that Rolls
But the price on that muthafucka ain't that low
Guaranteed that I'll bang that fo' if your fuckin' with the dude
Big shout from Cash Money Records, fuck You
Fuck you, fuck you nigga, muthafuck you

Cross it young nigga and you will die
Pumps, ride guns, even 25's
Cash Money got this, don't even try it
Stay where you from, don't bring no static
If not, then semi-automatic
This is the payback, pussy bitch stay back
Fuck you, yo' mama, yo' daddy and where you lay at
What's beef, beef is when you fuck with us
Guaranteed to lay yo' ass up under the bus
There's no one quicker than a hot boy nigga
That'll get you with the knife or pow with the trigger
There's no one keaner with the chrome Sarafina
Murder ain't nuttin' but a misdemeanor
Fuck you, fuck you nigga, muthafuck you
Fuck you, fuck you nigga, muthafuck you
Fuck you, fuck you nigga, muthafuck you
Fuck you, fuck you nigga, muthafuck you
Fo' sho' nigga, I'm gon' ride 'round my city and stunt my shit

Fuck a cutless, regals and rams V-12
Gotta have somethin' fast just to get out them jams
Got a big ass crib with a flow lil' fuck
Got a roof all glass and that bitch split up
Got a house built look like a Mercedes booth
Ferrari sofa set with the Lambo' wrench room
Leskitted up kitchen set and Rolls Royce wall
Jaguar floors and fuck all y'all
BMW lights, projectors to watch fights
Caddilac Benz, white fox for threads
Chin cheddar for Chi tower, ain't that crazy
I don't give a fuck homie, that's how I play it
Refridge designed like a Lexus with legs
In the fridge, it's quarters to replace the eggs

[Verse 1:]
The day started off with six chicks callin
Runnin off with game and then ballin
And no matter how trife they say you be
That's just how it go with the life you lead
Gotta keep it fresh so you cop what you wearin
(Fresh jeans, crisp tee this game is icy)
And now you gotta get a pair of timbs and that be just
The time when she walks in
Oooh

[Chorus:]
You never know
One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin
Ooo you never know
Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin
Guess you never know
When the game seem to change and you never be the same again
Ooo you never know
(you never know)
You never know

[Verse 2:]
So now you try to shake this thing that you feelin
But you can't cause her body got you feenin
No matter how many dimes you may have seen
Why is it that this one got what you need
So now you callin six times in a row
And you know it's gettin out of control
Cause now you walk around all day stressin and it started
From the time she walks in
Guess you never know

[Chorus:]
You never know
One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin
Ooo you never know
Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin
You never know
When the game seem to change and you never be the same again
Ooo you never know
(You never know)
You never know

[Bridge:]
Ooo ohhh oooo
It's funny when change come kickin in
And you look around and the pimp that you knew is vanishing
Nooo
You never thought that this could be
Judging by the thangs you used to do
And now you done with games and fast talking
The moment that she walked in

[Chorus:]
You never know
One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin
Ooo you never know
Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin
You never know
When the game seem to change and you never be the same again
Ooo you never know
(you never know)
You never know

[Half of the Bridge: Trey Songz]
Like when you try to shoot game and your shot don't fall the same
Ooh ooh
You play your cards don't seem to work
And you get your feelings hurt
I said you never know

[Chorus]
I, I'm horny (oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

I heard a dirty rumor that you were a friend of mine
I had to set you straight, in fact we're doing the deed
Your body gives faith to humanity
I hated all mankind
Your kiss, the cure to my insanity

Oh, cause you make me horny (I love that mouth)
You make me horny (and what comes out)
You make me horny, horny (I'm all about, horny)

I, I'm horny (oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

Your love is like a tumor, I don't want to be denied
Your love is like a hunger that a man want to feed
Your smoking hot without the vanity
You're my kind of daily grind
What kiss, a flame in my insanity
Oh, cause you make me horny (I love that mouth)
You make me horny (ooh, and what comes out)
You make me horny, horny (I'm all about, horny)
I'm horny

I, I'm horny (oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

Your body gives faith to humanity, I hated all mankind
Your kiss, the cure to my insanity

Oh, cause you make me horny (ooh, I love that mouth)
You make me horny (and what comes out)
You make me horny, horny (I'm all about, horny)
Cause you make me horny
Cause you make me horny
You make me horny, horny (I'm all about, horny)

I, I'm horny (oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

[Hook]
You might've seen me in the streets but nigga you don't know me
When you holla, when you speak, remember, you don't know me
Save all that hatin' and that poppin', nigga, you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas 'you my partner', nigga, you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin', nigga, you don't know me
Hey, I ain't trippin', pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I. but you don't know me
You be hatin' an' I see why cause you don't know me

[Verse 1]
I think it's time I made a song for niggas who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, I'ma real O.G
I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood 4 feet
So, all you niggas actin' bad, you gon' have to show me
You gone make me bring the Chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth full of gold teeth
When the guns start poppin', wonder when it's gone cease
Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cause today we gon' see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the fed's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'ma keep on flossin', poppin', long as Tomp is on the beat
Tell polices, I ain't stoppin', I'ma keep it in the streets
Contrary to your beliefs, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck ya thoughts and ya feelings, nigga, you don't know me

[Hook]
You might've seen me in the streets but nigga you don't know me
When you holla, when you speak, remember, you don't know me
Save all that hatin' and that poppin', nigga, you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas 'you my partner', nigga, you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin', nigga, you don't know me
Hey, I ain't trippin', pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I. but you don't know me
You be hatin' an' I see why cause you don't know me

[Verse 2]
Once again', let me remind you, nigga, you don't know me
So, don't be walkin' up and asking, what's the deal on a key
I don't know if you wearing wires, you could be the police
If I was slangin' blow, you couldn't get an O.Z
See me in' the PSC follow through at a show deep
Police holdin' up the door because they know we tote heat
I just wanna rap wi' C blowin' dro in' the fleet
Or wit clan by the dozen different bitches in' a week
I just wanna chill wit Kuntry an his daddy, Freddie G
Ballin' out at anytime, at any store an' spend a G
I wanna ball in' the Bahamas courtesy of K.T
MacBoney gotta mill but it's dolla D.P
A.K. house on the hill right next to JD
Every week, meet at Philant restaurant for lunch and eat free
Get in' they pay lil' Greg and B
That's the only shot we got at gettin', Cap back on the streets

[Hook]
You might've seen me in the streets but nigga you don't know me
When you holla, when you speak, remember, you don't know me
Save all that hatin' and that poppin', nigga, you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas 'you my partner', nigga, you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin', nigga, you don't know me
Hey, I ain't trippin', pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I. but you don't know me
You be hatin' an' I see why cause you don't know me

[Bridge]
You see a nigga hatin' on a G, ask him, what it's gon' be
What you lookin' at? Pussy nigga, you don't know me
At the club, in' the streets or wherever we should meet
It's choppers choppin', pistol poppin', nigga, you don't know me

[Hook]
You might've seen me in the streets but nigga you don't know me
When you holla, when you speak, remember, you don't know me
Save all that hatin' and that poppin', nigga, you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas 'you my partner', nigga, you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin', nigga, you don't know me
Hey, I ain't trippin', pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I. but you don't know me
You be hatin' an' I see why cause you don't know me
Yo, this Tone the referee, knawhatimean?
And I'm about to bring y'all some history
We got the best of both worlds
And I got the Get Fresh Crew
Doug Fresh! (one, two, three, come on!)

[Jay-Z]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Whose is the freshest of them all?
I love 'em all, but none of y'all
Is Doug E., as me and the boy Kelly
With the suicide doors, fuck 'em all
We got hits like a thirty shot clip
When we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor
Holla at your boy, boys
When we boys, so we bringin' out them toys
I ain't a lame, on them Dana Dane's
Wiggie, you annoyed man, when the year change, we change
Nigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank
We can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain
We can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young thing
That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Meeting Michelle at the hotel
While Jay and Tone on the way to the afterparty
Got the ladies sayin', oh

[Jay-Z]
Best of both worlds, and we rock the club
Youknowhatimsayin
Boy H-O, Kells, we not playing
Losers lose, so when we does what we do, we win
And win again, like deja vu
Then we win again, like M.J. do
Three-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue
Young Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's move

[Chorus 2x: R. Kelly]
In this arena, arena
All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up
This is for them hustlin' boys and girls
It's the return of best of both worlds

[Slick Rick]
Well once upon a time, they left the glove and the star, kid
He swore he was the man, but he was nothing but garbage
Let me rephrase that, bubblin' with pride
Did have skills, but he was ugly inside
Instead of uplift folks, sittin' on the non sense
Hurtin' people feelings like he didn't have a conscience
Like 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash
Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class
Even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
Then, got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
Swindlin', forgot the god above him
Finally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing
No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break
Bitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake
The moral of the story is, don't be a pair of knickers
Be good, boys and girls, and you can be as great as
Rick is

[Chorus 2x]

[R. Kelly w/ Doug E. Fresh beatboxing]
My baby momma's robe, my rent is overdue
It took half the pay, and now my life is filled with rainy days
But I stashed some dough, how much, you'll ever know
It's Doug Fresh, Slick Rick, Kells and Jay-Z
Come back to bed
A million things in your head
I see the pain in your eyes
I'll stay another night
It's okay, everything else can wait
Everything pushed aside
Lose track of time
I know it's hard
Let down your guard
And I'll turn down the lights
So we can start

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Let's foreplay
I get you to bend my way
No reason to put up a fight
I know what you like
I kiss your neck
You probably know what comes next...SEX
Oh, yes
It's not so hard
Let down your guards
I'll turn down the nights
So we can start

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna get back home
The only love I know
You're the only want that can make me stay
Yeah
I could go anywhere but still choose you again
I can't miss another day

There's a million reasons
A million ways
A million words
But I've said all I can say
There's only one thing I want out of all I could do
Out of a billion places
I only wanna be with you
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight
Just wanna be your lover
Wanna be your lover, wanna be your love tonight

[Jay-Z]
Uh, uhh uhh, Kel's

[Chorus 2X: are. Kelly + (Girl)]
Girl you know you got a body-adi-adi (do you like it?)
Where you get your little body-adi-adi (do you want it?)
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (what you want it?)
I just wanna take you home with me

[Jay-Z]
She get it from her momma..
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, it hotter than pajamas
We lay back, blowin ganja
Dvd, she make it hard to watch a flat tv - whoa
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice
I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap cd, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the "Moulin Rouge"
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
Are. O. C. For life cuz, the gang motherfucker

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]
I make ya hotter than the next bitch - no need
For you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected - by me
You get the keys to the Lexus - but no drive
You get your own 2002, she through ridin
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's - callin, me...

[Chorus:]

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rearview mirror
Oh her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and Lapearla underwear, clear?

[are. Kelly]
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin
Do what we came to do
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin
Baby I want you, yeah

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]
Fellas, a few tips, when you're in the club
You must watch your girl, because she may end up with me

[are. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]
Trackmasters (uhh... Turn the music up)
Rock Land
Hova (woo! Yess, yess)

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
Now somebody's girl is in my mansion
Shakin that ass to this
And somebody's girl is in my hot tub
Drinkin that glass of Crist'
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom
And man she's a superfreak
And somebody's girl is leavin my crib
Now on to the next booty

[Jay-Z]
Ummmmmmmmm, I don't mean no harm
But your boy got the magic stick, the Don Juan
Bishop, chicks'll dissapear in thin air
Like mist or some shit like this I swear
I take handcuffs off misses, I pick locks wicked
I catch your eye cause my tick-tock's frigid
My necklace glisten, all reckless chicks is
Eyeballin, yeah, and I caught 'em like perfect pitches
Call me Mike Piazza
Once I get 'em in, my fly casa
It's hot tubs, heated pools and no rules
Call your old dude and tell him he old news
Tell that fella you feel like Cinderella
With both shoes and it's almost two
Fuck a storybook endin, we bendin the rules
This is somebody's girl part two, now move

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]
Uhh, let me at it
Somebody's girl is sittin in my lap
Whisper two words and we both break out
My Maybach seats is just as big as a couch
Not the same girl now that the mic's at your mouth
Oh that's gettin nasty, let's get naughty
Rollin around like a fo'-wheel afterparty
We stop at a red light, there go your girls an' 'em
Now we got the green light, driver follow them (let's go)
You're rotatin with a guy that spend money like the world spin 'round
First guy to ever put the singin rap down
Say the name Kels and these chicks spellbound
Because these chicks know I put the "12Play" down
I gotta have it, I just can't stop limpin
Maybe because I just can't stop pimpin
No matter what I do, I can't stop leanin
When the fresh Prada's on and the sun is shinin
Girls it's your boyfriend
With that remix that keeps you clubbin
This collabo' crack got you fiendin
The industry kings and the rest is dreamin

[Chorus:]

[Jay-Z]
The moral of the tale, if you love your tail
Treat her well, keep her 'way from Hov' and Kel'
Because we can't stop pimpin
We put it on her 'til she can't stop limpin
She'll be a goner, you can play tough guy on the corner
I smoothe her out in the sauna
Yeah, I blew it out in the Bahamas, yeah
Your lil' mama got a stellar arm
We got it on like a telethon
Mr. Roc-A-Fella, gone

[Chorus:]

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on your troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

Nigga, all I blow is strong bitch I'm straight for the week

Order twenty-five bricks, I put em all on the streets
Bitch it's shaketown and we turnt up while you sleep
It's the good life, full of fun, seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life, lest you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love 'cause you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance
Yes, the good life, to be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartache when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember I still want you and in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss that good life goodbye
(musical interlude)
Please remember I still want you and in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss that good life goodbye

(It's blinding, it's just weird) That looks poisonous
(Ah, yeah) Seriously?
(Yeah, I'd say so)
(Y'know, spider venom's extra painful to primates)

[Verse: 2D]
Colourful sailors washed up on the shore
Caught up on bad times
Spider in the ditch, she saw it all
Went to train, ride to dance
Colorful sailors washed up on the shore
Met up on violence
Spider in the ditch, he saw it all
Waiting for the wrong time

[Verse 1]
I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

[Verse 2]
Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotized, I'm getting high on love with you
I couldn't live without you now, Oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain!

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you
Hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes
Drowning in blue
Outta control
What can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you!

This that stuntin music, yeah bitch, I just dos it
It's Lil B, and I'll muh'fuckin prove it, we run it!

(Swag!) Manye, shouts out to Lil Wayne, baby
(Shouts out to New Orleans!)
I can't believe niggas gettin money down there FUCK with me!
SWAG! (Weezy, I see you, what it do?)
Motherfucker party with bitches mayne, what it do?
(EH-HEHEHEHEHEH!) Yeah... Ayyyyy!

[Rakim]
I idolized my father, he taught me to survive the horror
Cause times is harder, the skies are darker
Look through the eyes of the snake, see inside the monster
To rise, need divide and conquer
If it's all about money, I don't respect your power, that's weak
They could prowl and devour, they cowards you ask me
Powers that be, mistreat us, mislead us
Thinking eventually we gon' bite the hand that feed us
Some of them, they tried to keep all up and from them
Move us all those and club them, eat, plural, it's on them
New order of the ages, out of many one
While the rest of us is calmed out of pennies
None us starving, it's problems we ain't fed quickly
Our brethren's would be the ones shaking heads with me
Jealousy, hate, lust and greed would spread quickly
Don't call me brother if you ain't breaking bread with me

[Chorus: Shontelle] + (DMX)
Don't call me mother (Ohhh)
Don't call me sister (Nooo)
Don't call me brother (Whoooa)
Don't call me father (Don't call me! Don't call me!)
(Repeat)

[DMX]
Don't call me brother, we ain't got the same mother
Or the same father, you get down like the other
Don't speak on wisdom when you know you don't love her
Don't shake my hand when you wanna see me under
Don't talk slick behind my back
Don't walk like this when you act like that
You tryna bark on when instead you a cat
Come to your hood like "BAP! BAP! BAP!"
Mess with the kid if you want to
But your mans and them tell you it'll be the last thing that you would do
You built like a scooter, I'm built like a hummer
Was built like a tank, you don't want it baby, uh uh
Stop playing with D, it'll get you hurt
You a girl, you can't play in the dirt, you wear a skirt
You don't know a damn thing about putting in work
With your whole effin blocks up the murder type, arf

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Grrr
It's a start
And they don't know what it is
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS!

AY! (14X)

[Shontelle]
No no no

[Chorus till fade]
Uh, uh
She thought that I'd be her keeper
I don't think I ever saw a girl so fly!
Since I said nice to meet ya, I don't wanna leave her
Uh, I think I wanna make you mine!
Uh, baby you're a diva
I don't wanna see her in the whip with another guy
Come on to the table
I got what you came for
Pick up a glass, girl and let's get right!

[Bridge:]
Cause you got a hell of a body
Let me take you to jail lil mami
You got what I need
And you got what you came for
I can get you what these other niggas ain't able!

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby girl we're doing it
It's so good!
Make 'em other niggas wanna do it like this!
Oh, baby girl we're doing it
It's so good!
I keep on buying bottles if you keep on doing that!
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it!
Tell 'em bring the fireworks to my table!
Go ahead and do it, do it, do it, do it
Keep on moving, as long as you can do it!
She said flex like that and I'm a give her some
And she won't want more drinking, I'm a give her one!
I'm a bring that ace of spades and some roses
I got bounce on baby, you can make some your way!

[Bridge:]
Cause you got a hell of a body
Let me take you to jail lil mami
You got what I need
And you got what you came for
I can get you what these other niggas ain't able!

[Chorus: x2]
Oh, baby girl we're doing it
It's so good!
Make 'em other niggas wanna do it like this!
Oh, baby girl we're doing it
It's so good!
I keep on buying bottles if you keep on doing that!

So why the hell don't you try it?

Uhh
Ah, you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand

I was talking to an Eskimo
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow
When up popped a sea lion ready to go

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I want to lay low
The low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm
Take me down, Jimmy

Ah, at the Houses of Parliament
Everybody's talking 'bout the President
We all chip in for a bag of cement

Ollie Hardy should have had more sense
He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence
All for the sake of a couple of pence
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I want to lay low
The low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm

Let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I want to lay low
The low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm
Everybody tag along

I took my bag into a grocer's store
The price is higher than the time before
Old man asked me why is it more

I said, you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I want to lay low
(Down to Junior's Farm)
The low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm
(Down to Junior's Farm)
Let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's farm where I want to lay low
The low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's farm
(Down to Junior's Farm)
Everybody tag along
(Down to tag along)
Take me down to Junior's farm

Take me back
Take me back
I wanna go back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uhh, y'all know what this is
Now would be a good time to start bobbin your heads
Kels, and it, and it, uhh

[R. Kelly]
Excuse me miss, don't mean to interrupt
But you're the hottest chick in this club
The way you shake your ass to this beat
It's like your booty got dancin feet
I wanna take you home, in my Hummer Jeep
All over me while you ridin the beep beep
I just really wanna taste your ice cream
It's the weekend baby I got the {?}
Go on girl, the way you do me
This is somethin like a fantasy
You're that girl from the magazine
BET, or, MTV
So baby let me take you to my ecstasy
Pull up to the club on them 23's
Girl you've got that shit in your hip
That make me wanna spend, money

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Pretty girls (where you at)
I'm talkin to the ones, that came alone
Pretty girls (put your hands up)
The single ones, we wanna take you home - c'mon
Pretty girls... (you make me wanna shout)
Let's, go!

[Jay-Z]
Whether you tall like Lisa Leslie
Or short like the barrel on that baby 380
Pretty lady, I got a ride to fit yo' frame
From the Coupe to the big Mercedes
{?}, these groundhogs stay with the cash
And the black card don't got no max
Fall, back, blow on some Merikesh hash
With more Manolos than Sarah Jess' had
How you gon' go back to dudes with little sacks
Little kiddie chromes in they itty bitty homes
Fuckin up your lungs, puffin that homegrown
You should be with us, cuttin in Hong Kong
Straight shots of Catron or Dom Perignon
Guys your girls say Shawn very long
So if you ain't afraid of catchin a love jones
Get with Coach Dean Smith, bitch get in the zone, c'mon

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Tell me what you're drinkin at the bar ma
I'm gonna buy ma, anybody tell you youse a star ma
You remind me of my car ma, no ignition
I start the Coupe up from the kitchen
My pretty girls get plenty attention
When it come to sex get plenty of inches
We shop, like we all broke detention
Club like we at a alcoholic's convention
Hit the 'tel with two chicks and she with it
Mama got down like the flo' when she did it
Pretty girls, keep shakin ass now mama
This party is not over

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
What's your name, what city you represent ma
Where the hands on all the pretty girls ma
For the players and the hustlers in the club now
And all my niggas that be sippin pimp juice now

[Chorus]

(Intro: Children's song)
The baker in the bakery
Stacking bread in the bakery
Baking fresh and soon you'll see
Bakery is the name
(Intro: Snoop Dogg)
Aye, yo, Dada, why'd'you hit 'em with one of those gangster ass videos?
Lay low, getting' this weed money, me and my cous'
Yeah, you know how we do
But I wanna hold that baby for a minute now
See, about to knock 'er
See what it takes for her to be knocked
What it is, trip

(Hook)
Baby, what's yo' pleasure?
I be there for you, baby!
Even through stormy weather

(Verse)
Huh, what did you prefer, let me accommodate
To get your head up, to get your head straight
We started out with a quote, and now it's starting eight(?)
When you and Ali back, I blow it in ya face
I can tell that ya high because you' laughing
Now quit your babblin', girl, you blasting
She wants some cake in her system, she wants a shot of that
Moscato with the lemon, yeah, with a shot of yeah
Man, that's a hell of commendation, put you on your back
She take three more shots, she already did that
Now she in the mood tonight to get freaky
I can tell that she buzzing, she getting kinky
Yes, she loving and dabbing, she getting wild
In with more than one girl, Snoop in dial
Hit the stormy weather, yeah, it's fifty below
We in a smoke storm, baby, light it up and let's go!
(Hook)
See, that's why we push it
And go faster
Tell me how to get it on
If you got the septic on the phone
We go and smoke it off to this door?
Girl I wanna smoke wit ya
You wanna smoke wit me
The first time I'm feelin out your fantasy
It's the man in me
And the woman in you
To make us do the things we do
We got something in common
I don't know what it is
We can be lost or we can be free
Now I did like many ladies in my day
But just like the smoke, they get blown away
Like a glass of wine, sit back and rewind
But back into time, let the feeling rewind
I don't know what it is and I don't know what it was
But it's DPG, me and my big cous'
Yellow Benz wit a spoiler kit wit my spoiled little chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist match this yellow bitch
She a trip shawty she shit she know she the shit
If u dont buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch shawty mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid give her candy stick
She a bitch make her flip a brick make her sic a chick
Since legit ive been swaggin dick Gucci Mane the shit
I met a girl name Susie I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie so I let her in my coup
I snatched her in my fender while I stashed her in matire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in cero eight walry but that girl on fire
Pull us over calaboaty said she heisipieicis
Ten percent in my car shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir better yet singing like mya bitch

Well my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think im loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit all the ballas I be in all the spots
I might be in yo kitchen nigga cooking with yo pops
I think I love her
I think I love her
I know I love her
I know I love her
I think I love her

Soulja boy man polow da don I think I love this girl man huh

She sweet but keep keep she stings her eye ring
Two piece she dime piece and jeans they dead meat
She sweet she so deep she read with good teeth
Two jobs she get cheese her dates are my treat
How neat she loves to eat we eat bon appetite
We fed she so neat and like me she so neat

Nigga I weighs top but I run the block
This bitch is so hot my clip is close shot
My wrist froze with rocks I cops all the drops
I rode all the nots exposed the have nots
My hoes hoes will pop like young goldie locks
We got white bolgin rocks sip locks stocks the cot
We never close the shops we hot steaming hot
I'm Susie Sarah got a click clack pop pop

I think I love her
I think I love her
I know I love her
I know I love her

[are. Kelly]
Mmmmm.. Ohhhh, ohhhohhhhh
Oooohhh.. Ohhh no, mmmmm

[Chorus: are. Kelly + (Jay-Z)*]
You and me, havin s**
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, havin s** yeahh
After an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)

[*overlapping R's last line]

I storm in, she storm out
It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house
It's a little seperation but I know how to fix the situation
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation
So I gotta give her thug reperations
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughin and we back friends

[Interlude: are. Kelly]
You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug
You know the words girl let's make up
So much love to be made
Instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?"
Girl I don't wanna.. Let you go, I need you so

[Chorus:]

[Jay-Z]
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"
Translated it means

[R] Hit it hard from the back
Yeah she hid my car keys
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat

[Interlude]

[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]

[are. Kelly]
I don't want.. Baby I don't want to fight
I just wanna make it right (ooh yeah)
Put out problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)
Baby I don't want to fight
I just wanna make it right (ohhhhh love)
Put our problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight

[Jay-Z]
S** so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face
Cute s** game like our very first date
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait
But oh! I know just where your hot spot at
You can not deny that, so do not try that
I do not buy that..

[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]

[Chorus w/o Jay-Z (fades out)]
Every soldier got a story to tell

I done been through it all
Don't ask the way I shoot 'cause I done shot (uggh)
Put a tank on my block
Fiend gone get the scene hot

Greens and rocks
Burnin' flesh
Have you ever smelled nigga?
Been tapped up, ready to die from mail niggas

Straight goin' to hell
But livin' the dirty, dirty
Havin' yah mama worry
That (?)

Tired of being blast at, but didn't cast that
I done asked for my life, and right there was laughed at
But when I backtracked, (?)
Blast back
Told 'em to cast that, take these rounds and add that
But fact is you don't fuckin' choose yo' wars
Or be like me muthafucka and do it with two guns

[Chorus: x3]
Check my war wounds (uggggh)
My war wounds (ugggh)
Every soldier got a story to tell

My adversary's get popped
Got me runnin' from cops
The ghetto life be a dime
Got me carryin' two Glocks

My enemies is bad
Chop limes of grass
Drive-bys and rags
And representin' red and blue flags

See I got fools from the ghetto
Like my cousin' Jimmy wear permanent metals
My evidence is satus with hoes
Bloody Polos

Pullin' in car do's
And cut up Jabos

[Chorus: x2]
I'm down the blast for my homies
And cash for my homies
Even if I'm old G I'll be down to ride and die
If the hood call me

That's why I be hustin' every day
Could you imagine me with no stash?
Like a bank with no cash
Tryin' drive a car with no gas

And fuck one day with no tag?
Shotgun with no class
Window with no glass
Or all you girls with no ass

See I'm a risky rider
Caliope crawler
A Down South Hustla
Plus a head buster from New Orleans

See I gotta be a paid nigga
A made nigga
Be the nigga to bust yo' shit
And the nigga the be the grave digga
See my tattoos reveal some of the shit I done did
But the move of other niggas that bout it
Feel the shit I do just tah live
See I been scared, popped at, and shot at

But I live an eye for eye
So the enemies I ain't forgot that

[Chorus: x2]
It's real, shit's real check my war wounds
This here real life, ain't no fuckin' cartoons
I'm the Saudi Arabian death killin' veteran on the tube
Either me or you right here

Come back and hang out in my room
I done shot my rifle, trained to kill
Got blood on my fatiques
Once you in ain't no turnin' back

Lay yo' ass over seas
Might as well handle your business
There's no overcome to this shit
Be on yo' Ps and Qs nigga

Don't cry like no bitch
You see a weak nigga, that's a beat nigga
And fuck a stead nigga, that's a dead nigga
Tell my mama not to worry bout me why I'm gone

If I die bitch, box me up and ship me back home
Bury me in the N.O. with my stripes on my chest
Tell them muthafuckas that I did my best
Middle finga pointin' sayin' fuck Iraq
If you don't believe me check my combat pack

[Chorus: x3]
I got a motherfuckin' story to tell
Nigga, nigga what?
A motherfuckin' story to tell (What?)
Fool, I got a muthafuckin' story the tell

And every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
I shank niggas, bank niggas
Do mo' for show
Seven cluckas, fake dough

Stayin' way cut throat
I hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
Up all night gettin' in gun fights
I strike my head on the wall

Seven Eight ward
Eastside, rollin' dubs
Call me big Snoop Dogg
Follow me, and you'll see how Gs move

It's written on my face
I takes my war wounds
Been around drama since me and my mama
Use to listen to oldies

That's why I'm so old G
Look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside
When y'all was learnin' how the sing
I was learnin' how the bang and ride

For sure bro, I told you
I'm a gangsta soul ja, blowin' doja
What a story tah tell...

Doesn't matter if that helps
It's a difference when I'm there
In front of you

Balance my stance just in case
I will fall into my place
So you push me with your hands to wake me up

[RADAMES]
I'm sorry for everything I said
And for anything, I forgot to say, too
When things get so complicated
I stumble, at best, muddle through
I wish that our lives could be simple
I don't want the world, only you
I wish I could tell you this face to face
But there's never the time, never the place
So this letter will have to do
I love you
So I let the bitch hang out with me right
You know word got around I was fucking this nigga bitch
So the nigga called me, he like "you fuckin my bitch"-
I'm like I'm fuckin her right now

[Chorus]
Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls

Told that bitch take your shoes off, look don't even argue
Got your bitch tip-toeing on Italian marble
They on that bad batch, too much pork around it
Shorty ass fat you gotta walk around it
Big body got ten of those
Cars, cribs that's eight hoes
Nine piece that's dinner rolls
Wild freaks, that centrefold
Hundred on my shine
You don't like it fine
Got ya bitch tip-toeing like Gregory Hines
Cashing out with that nina
Ten days you ain't seen her
She ask for it, I beat her
You greedy nigga you eat it
These ? niggas all on my dick
Princess cuts all in my wrist
Hundred rounds all in my hip
200 grand all in my whip

[Chorus]
Wet work, got the kitchen stanking
We call a undercover, a pig in the blanket
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Shoot you in ya head like Abraham Lincoln
Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman
Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan
Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers
Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder
All my hoes pretty, all my niggas brazy
We sell that white, sell that brown, call it rice and gravy
Call me Tunechi Lee or don't call me at all
Man fuck all you niggas, pause

[Chorus]
2 Chainz, that's your best answer
Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer
I might do that walk for the 5k
I get paid every time I leave my driveway
Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbours stay in another county
Ted Dibiase in Versace loafers
All you talk is shit nigga halitosis
Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang
Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain
Goddamn!

[Chorus]
Oooh, oh my darling
Oh my love yeah
Oooh oh oh, yeah yeah

Peso, peso, peso, peso, peso, peso

Peso, peso, peso, peso, peso, peso
Shit, I be goin' hard... (I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need)

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Kells
I be going hard for them pesos
Came from the bottom made a milli
Squad move when I say so
Gotta bring them dollars to the city
Muthafuckas thought I wasn't living
Daddy thought I never could've did it
Now my hood see that Wahoo fitted on the TV screen next to Diddy
Praise God for my brothers
I'll rob for my brothers
Cause when times was hard I flipped that pack like somersaults for my brothers
And I never ride with them suckers
Dick hard for my bitch
And without me half of these rappers wouldn't exist, shit I be going hard for that...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
My taste level on Ace level
Spade nigga for a paid nigga
We darkskinned, south of France
All acting like Jay nigga
Jetski and I'm jetlagged
Still smelling like jet fuel
That PJ split three ways, 60 making that jet move
My pesos from Play Cloths, Pyrex from Pedro
Tags pop from Pucci to Paul Smith to Penrose
Been down, that's ten toes
Score nigga, that's endzone
Ask me I sell dope, N-O from this Benzo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I'm getting paid when I wake up cause I hustle hard before I go to sleep
And now I got my cake up, I'm balling hard like I'm suppose to be
Got bad bitches tryna roll with me
White bitches like "totally"
V.S. stones all over me
And I'm killing niggas no first degree
Cause I'm going hard for that peso
Selling blocks no lego
Got killers all on my payroll
And they shoot like O.J. Mayo
In the coupe, pull up like "hey ho"
With the top down on that bitch
And when they cat scan my body it was dollar signs on that bitch, whoa!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Many men has met his fate, murder I premeditate
The world is low, the devil waits so I stay high as heaven gates
See I'm on it everyday, minutes never go to waste
If ain't no profit on the way then we cannot negotiate
Scripture texts for holy sakes, who's tellin' what the Lord will say
Until that day, I'll be tunnel vision on the paper chase
Odd Future, fuck your feelings, check the score we fuckin' winnin'
Check the list we in the building, stupid swag, Paris Hilton
More potential, you's a liar, step up we will crucify ya
Head first, yea it's going down like a scuba diver
Need the fire, I'll supply ya, put the hire on the block
Swag on deck, if you need it I be overstocked

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I'm a brother man with a swagger from the motherlands
It tells my hands and rubs my glands, I'm I'll as fuck, bitch fuck your mans
Chingy chong, I'm in Japan, Chinch and Chong wrapped in seran
Keep the bong hash in my canister, I'm headed where it's handed first
Domo rollin' up, Left Brain already smokin'
You smell that loud ounce? Mary Jane has already spoken
My shades on, bitch I'm lokin', no need for aggravations
Cause a fake nigga in his death bed will be fuckin' collaboratin'
Kush escaped without a roller, high roller, no time for strollers
Made it stoned because I'm workin' over, too many posers tryin' to rob my bowl
I'm pretty sure Tyler will represent it, I fell asleep before you bitch niggas present it
I'm fuckin' authentic, remember it, you motherfuckers pretending

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Me and Leggo just skate at the mall
Next thing you know wildin' out at Watch the Throne
I had a dead phone so I gave that little nigga my cam
He snapped that shit, the motherfuckers went HAM
Like Miss Piggy cunt around Kermit
I'm like how many fucks can I get a day?
Fuck respect, I'd rather hang myself on the wall with a noose on neck
Before I change to fit in your block, so I'll make sure I cannot fit in a house
And I hate genres, fuck hip hop with their searching cop high top flip flops
In the middle of the winter, y'all like fuck them kids, like a weird babysitter might say
No diggity, I'm still tryin' to find it but I lost it somewhere in Austin
In a creek with Dawson and this vegan bitch tryin' to eat my sausage
That sounds awesome
Fuck these parties, I'm real awkward
I stand there, I don't know what to do man
I'd rather be at home with my crew and my new rooms, staring at my brand new MoonMan
Listening to MF Doom and Wooh Da Kid and Bricksquad 1017
Shout out to Waka, rest in peace Slim
Golf Wang motherfuckin' triple six we is 3 twins
Free my little nigga sweatshirt
Gay name stitched into my sweatshirt
Bow down until your motherfuckin' neck hurt
Respect me. Do we run shit? Nigga, yes indeed
Cheesh and Chong, I need a bong
But I do have friends who got weed that's strong
I need a treehouse, airhockey, ping pong, a mini ramp
Throwing that tramp on a trampoline
(Have you heard the end of the Window?)
Nigga fuck the team
Hey, I'm just playin', I love you niggas
I hate these niggas, fuck these niggas
Fuck everybody who doubted me
The only ones I care about's the ones that surround me
Odd Future!

[Outro: Tyler the Creator]
Fuck all you industry niggas man
Y'all see me at parties, start comin' up sayin'
"We must collab" I don't fuck with none of you niggas
All y'all can suck my motherfuckin' dick
Fuck all you labels
Fuck every fuckin' DJ I hope y'all don't play none of my shit
Suck my motherfuckin' dick
And don't come up to me at the next event
I don't want your fuckin' number, your business card
Fuck your company, I'm not performin' at none of your shit
Don't ask for my fuckin' manager's email
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
Golf Wang, Free Earl nigga
Fuck Steve Harvey
I'll get my cure
Wait in the car
I won't remember
Who you are

I look at you
And feel the same
Could you forgive me
For that pain?

Pariah kid
Lost in a game
Can you forgive me
For that pain?
Talking loud, talking crazy
Lock me outside
Prayin' for the rain to come
Bone dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
But I'm in your way
It hurts, that I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Oh, passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe (I can't believe) what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for us
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for us
What I did for love
I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
Just too much at stake
It hurts, that I remember every scar (I remember every scar)
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part
I can't believe what I did for love (I can't believe)
I can't believe what I did for us
Oh passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for us
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
I can't believe what I did for love
Hey! Ha!
Mmm-hmm
I like how this is sounding
Hold on, everybody
Here we go
Not quite yet
Pretty soon
Mr. Robin Thicke, any minute now
Alright, here we go
Take it away

It is the night
My body's weak (Sure)
I'm on the run, no time to sleep ('Cause you're on the run)
I've got to ride, ride like the wind (Right)
To be free again (We all want that)

And I've got such a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I ride (God, I sound good) like the wind
Ride like the wind
(You're riding like the wind for those who don't know)
I was born the son of a lawless man (You mean Alan Thicke?)
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand (That sounds dangerous)
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind, yeah

And I've got such a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico (Nailed it again)
So I ride, like the wind (Ride like the wind)
Ride like the wind
(Oh my) Gonna ride like the wind

Yes! Ha!
(Ooh)
Oh my
It's gettin' hot in here
It's a hot wind
That's right
(Ooh)
Ooh, I can do that too
Ooh, see?
I can make those noises
(Yeah) Yeah

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do what I was told ('Cause you're not dependable)
Gonna ride like the wind (Nope) before I get old
It is the night
My body's weak (Right, 'cause you're running)
I'm on the run, no time to sleep (Well, that's why your body's weak)
I've got to ride, ride like the wind (You better ride like the wind)
To be free again, yeah

And I've got such a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico (Why is he singing lead? I'm much better)
So I ride, ride like the wind
Ride like the wind (Is Robin sharp or am I? I think it's him, right?)

And I've got such a long way to go (Such a long way to go)
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I ride, ride like the wind (I don't know if I'd go to Mexico)
Ride like the wind (Maybe just stop in Phoenix)
Gonna ride like the wind

That's right, folks
When Ron Burgundy rides, he rides like the wind (Ooh)
Not like a Subaru or a golf cart
Like the god-darn wind
Powerful and sleek and invisible
Feel that draft up your skirt, ladies?
That's me
Okay, that was creepy, I'm sorry
I smoked a funny cigarette with this Robin Thicke guy
And let's just say the filter is off (Ooh)
Anyway, I feel like I've gone on too long
Let me hit you with this
Three feet of polished nickel
Valves and my sweet breath
Ride like the wind
Ride like, ride, ride like the wind
Ride like the wind, yeah
Ride like the wind
Ooh
Ride like the wind, yeah
Ride like the wind, yeah

That was a blast, Robin
Wanna get a drink?
Where'd he go?
Oh, he just left?
Well, that's fine, I have plenty to do, plenty!
I don't need to hang out with Robin Thicke
Hey you, uh, sound engineer, do you wanna get a beer?
No? You're good?
Oh okay
Good, because I don't want one either
Alright, well, I do need a ride home
It's alright, I'll take mass transit
Okay
Who turned the lights off?
Let me get out of the recording booth at least
I'm locked in here
Excuse me, I'm locked in here
Why is the song still going? I'm locked in the booth!
Oh my gosh, I can't breathe anymore
There's a lack of oxygen here
I don't wanna die like this
No, I've too much to live for
I don't wanna die like this
Never mind, the door was stuck
I'm good
Alright, bye-bye
Heh, I'm saying goodbye to no one
Bye

[Monologue]
Now listen...lemme preach to 'em
Lemme show 'em why..w-w-what it take...
I ain't gonna say why I'm better than others
'couse i ain't better than nobody, actually
But lemme show 'em why I'm a lot different from everybody else
Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference

The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything
So why wouldn't I do this all the time?
See that's the difference between you and I
You get money and you get crazy
I get crazy and I get money
And the biggest difference between you and I is...
You love me and I hate you

[Jay-Z]
That nigga let his fuckin flow go
Niggas tryin to switch up the flows on niggas
Hit niggas, slip niggas with a micky
Drop that joint

Yeah yeah (it's the remix y'all)
Like a muh'fucker (oh yeah)
Whassup my nigga (and still hot up in that boy, ain't it man)
(Yo Jay, Kel, fin' ta set it off for y'all)
C'mon

[are. Kelly]
It's, the, remix
Trackmaster remix y'all, Kels and Jigga
Big chips with Twista y'all, get this money

[Twista]
I, heard the ballers when I pulled up to the club
Cause I'm rollin up on fo' flickers
Peanut-butter interior, black body
And in case you didn't know, I be the Twista
Hundred bombs in my pockets, put your ones up
I hear some niggas lookin at me for the come up
Try to creep creep, I pull a gun up
I put a hole in the first nigga that run up
The ballers be Jay, are, and T
Spit it cold cause the music is a part of me
Can't nobody spit it fast as me
Got an academy of haters comin after me
I know I got what you want, I know I got what you need
Come and mob to the top before you get, this, money
Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley
Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me
Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50
Gettin that money my nigga
Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts
Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front
Twenty-two inch shoes, cv's in the trunk
Gettin that money my nigga
Makin dough off a style I be the best in
Glad to be down with these two livin legends
Now let me see which league I'ma invest in
Gettin that money my nigga
Rollin this cheer, put the niggas in fear
Makin bitches she'd tears, take a look at my career
Now the shit's swell; when I get up to 70 in the Coupe
Peep the wing when I hope out the tail - tell 'em Kel

[Chorus: are. Kelly]
We off up in the club, we got our hands up
Drinks in the club because we gettin that money my nigga
We rollin 24's, open them Bentley do's
Got plenty hoes because we gettin that money my nigga

[are. Kelly]
Pull up to the club, chicks in the back
Some smokin on weed, some sippin Co-gnac
Into the club, whole crew to the back
Super the stars make it sharp as a tack
Gotta have my forty-five inch in it
In the house, from the gate, twenty minutes
Game over and I'm still not finished
I play haters like V play tennis
Livin like a motherfuckin Richie Rich nigga
Got a butler for my Maybach nigga
White linen, smokin ci-gar
Lyrics like bullets, tongue like a trigger
Feelin on your booty
Tryin to get one of these nice ladies
To come up to my room and do, me
Have her man like who's, he
Was a pimp at birth, first ho was a nurse
And I'ma be a pimp 'til I'm stretches in a hearse
Sometimes showbiz is the worst
I'm blessed with "The Gift & The Curse," whoa
Shoot ball, now I'm off to the spa
Fresh and clean, now I'm off in the car
Got a date with a superstar
We take lunch, now twelve o'clock
Hit the mall bout two o'clock
In the movies bout five o'clock
Seven o'clock 'til nine o'clock
We in my crib, my bed, goin non-stop
This for my project niggas, widebody Mo' sippers
Pimps hustlers herb flippers, get, this, money

[Chorus:]

[Jay-Z]
Gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks
Like I'm just addicted to difference you pick what you want from me
To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain
Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes
It's just insane, is it? I'm from the district where niggas
Either in prison or pay visits like in-laws
So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw
We can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar?
Lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive
Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga

[Chorus:]

[are. Kelly]
Trackmaster remix y'all, Kels and Jigga
Big chips with Twista y'all, get this money

Cause I'm a gangsta ass nigga from YMCMB
This nigga been shot, but you already know that
He went to jail recently and Monster Kody taught him
"This ain't no place for you, you see bein' locked up 24 hours a day
That shit ain't gangsta, you see bein' outside takin' care of your family
That's the most gangsta shit a nigga could ever do"
He said "The shit ideal for takin' em out the hood
Givin' em a chance to be some motherf*ckin' body
Now that shit was gangsta"
Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart, when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your beat, she's so close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort, please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Too close, too close for comfort, please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
So be firm and be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now
Too close, much too close
She's much too close for comfort now

[x7 while Stat Quo doing verse 1]

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
The moment I cut her I knew she had me
The way she scratch my back and call me daddy
Shotgun in the Broham Caddy
Sexy physique and she cook like Patty Labelle
Her talk, her walk, our chain
I love the way shorty work that thang
Hump sprung I gotta charge to the game
Stat Quo on the rap, I'ma let T-Pain sing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh, I'm sick when you tellin me you leavin me
What did I do to you to make you hate me, the way you do?
I'm tired of all the games that you wanna play with me
Cuz you wanna get away from me
Maaan you really don't deserve me, all you wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from you
Now I'm leavin quickly, before the guys come to get me
Cuz I'm takin everything with me, but it all comes down to

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Out to get me..
..got me doin things I'd never do

[Verse 3:]
You tellin me you sprung, well I'm sprung too
Only think bad about it, is i'm sprung for you
I ain't throwin in your face what I've done for you
But I have visions to see us on a honeymoon
Damn right, I'm on my way to the crib
I have no means to tellin you how I feel, cuz it's all done now
All your clothes and your shoes 'bout to get thrown out
All your tires 'bout to get blown out
I feel bad cuz you think it's easy
You told me a year and 2 months ago, you would never leave me
But now it's like you hate to see me
I remember the first day, you couldn't wait to see me
But now you wanna take everything and leave
But what happened to the love that you had for me?
You said you would marry me
It's too bad, cuz I'm sprung

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Out to get me..
..got me doin things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

Are you under the impression
This isn't your life?
Do you dabble in depression?
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh, this is a fact
That you need to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Wilco, Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby
Are times getting tough?
Are the roads you travel rough?
Have you had enough of the old?
Tired of being exposed to the cold?
Stare at your stereo
Put on your headphones
Before you explode
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Wilco, Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby
There's so many wars that just can't be won
Oh, oh, oh

Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh, this is a fact
That you need to know

I can see my baby swinging
Ooh, baby, baby, I love you
I can see my baby swinging
Ooh, baby, baby, I love you
I can see my baby swinging
Ooh, baby, baby, I love you
I can see my baby swinging

Down on the West Coast they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin' then you're not playin'."
But you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast I get this feeling like
It all could happen that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah you

I can see my baby swinging
I can see my baby swinging
Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigon
And you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
And you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?

I can see my baby swinging
I can see my baby swinging

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, our love

Lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now
Lookin' at the world and everything that passes
Seems a rosy hue somehow
Why do I feel so spry?
Don't blink your eye
Needn't guess, I'll confess
Certain someone just said 'yes'
In a bungalow all covered with roses
I will settle down, I vow
That's why I'm lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now

Oh yes, I'm lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now
Lookin' at the world and everything that passes
Seems a rosy hue somehow
Why do I feel so spry?
Don't blink your eye
Needn't guess, I'll confess
Certain someone just said 'yes'
In a bungalow all covered with roses
I will settle down, I vow
That's why I'm lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
Everything is rosy now
Yes, everything is rosy now
Well whatchya doing, baby, in the snow?
You know you're groovy, but you move too slow
And when you're crazy, girl, how it shows
You're just a smoothie with a heart made of cold

Well whatchya doin', baby, in the snow?
You're just a groovy, baby, in the snow
Strawberry smoothie, baby, in the snow
Ooh

In the blizzard, honey, you're a hound
You're headed nowhere with eyes glued to the ground
So pick your head up, honey, look around
Go pick your pieces up from the lost and found

Well whatchya doin', baby, in the snow?
You're just a groovy, baby, in the snow
Strawberry smoothie, baby, in the snow
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[SOLDIERS]
Oh, oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave
Oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave

[RADAMES]
We have swept to glory
Egypt's mastery expands
From the Nile's northern delta
To the dry, dry southern sands

The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return

[SOLDIERS]
Oh, oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave

[RADAMES]
It's all worked out, my road is clear
The lines of latitude extend
Way beyond my wildest dreams
Toward some great triumphant end

We seized the day
We turned the tide
We touched the stars
We mocked the grave
We moved into uncharted lands

[RADAMES/SOLDIERS]
Fortune favors the brave

[RADAMES]
The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return

Nothing is an accident
We are free to have it all
We are what we want to be
It's in ourselves to rise or fall
This is easy to believe
When distant places call to me
It's harder from the palace yard
Fortune favors the free...

[SOLDIERS]
Oh, oh, oh

[RADAMES]
Fortune favors the young...

[SOLDIERS]
Oh, oh, oh

[RADAMES]
Fortune favors the brave!

[Intro]
Uh, ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When people talk of love
I'll lead the conversation
I'll say I feel just fine
Happy with my situation
But when I look away, huh
People know my mind is straying
To where I once belonged
Dreaming about your heart again

[Chorus 1]
(Your heart again) Yeah
Your heart again
Let me in your heart again
Listen to me honey

[Verse 2]
When you have to face the blues
I give you satisfaction
(It's your heart again)
Despair was on your mind
I gave you the right direction
(It's your heart again)
So don't you walk away
Remember it's my heart you're breaking
You forget we were in love
Now my heart is only filled with pain

[Chorus 2]
(Your heart again) Oh
(Your heart again) Heart again
Let me in your heart again

[Bridge]
Oh, my love
I want you to stay
Don't leave me now
Or I'll just fade away
Oh, my love, don't hurt me this way

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, forgive me, babe
Do not ever tell me goodbye
Ooh
Tell me yes
Oh
Don't make me wait too long
Or I'll lose my mind

[Verse 3]
When people talk of love
I have no hesitation
(It's your heart again)
Tell me what you're dreaming of
I'll hold that conversation for you, baby
(It's your heart again)
(Ooh) But when I look away, huh
(Ooh) People know my mind is straying, baby
To where I once belonged
Just let me in your heart again (Heart again)

[Chorus 3]
Your heart again (Heart again)
Oh, (Let me in) let me in your heart again (Your heart again)

[Outro]
Open the doors for me, baby
To your heart again
Let me in
Hey, let me
Let me live, uh
Whoo!
Let me live and live in your heart again
I'm somebody, somebody
And nobody's gonna hold me down
No, no nobody nobody nobody's
Gonna hold me down

Move right out of my life
Move it, move it
Love, love me baby

Heavy, heavy
You got so heavy baby
(Yeah)
Heavy heavy
I'm somebody, somebody
And nobody's gonna hold me down
No, no nobody nobody nobody's
Gonna hold me down
I'm somebody

[Verse 1]
Ohh
Dream on my world
I live on my world
Going out my head, down to somewhere
Goin' on a dance hall tune
In a pressure today
I blew a bad man away today
Had a gun, had to be done
I blew a man away

[Chorus]
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep

[Verse 2]
Dream on the street
People passing through me, yes, they do
Want mine back. I want my heart mend?
I'm gonna bring it all back

[Chorus]
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep

[Outro]
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Now that I, that's right
The river and people seem to die
And keep on to this, keep on
The river ain't deep, the river ain't deep, the river ain't deep
Verse 1
Whoa
I'm telling you now
You should try to talk before you shout
We had it all before we found
That the only thing anyone wanted was more
Verse 2
We exceeded everyone
We would have pleaded to have won
We can look back on what we've done
And say that we know that we've gone and done it all
Chorus
Never answer again
Not to anyone
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
I hope you realise i won't let this go
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
And now you're off the rails
Your stupid ship has sailed
(whoa whoa)
I'm letting go
(We did it all)
Verse 3
We had it all
But you can't buy us with a win full
If you don't give us what we want
Then we'll push it right back
Cus' we're in for the long run
(the long run)
Chorus
Never answer again
Not to anyone
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
I hope you realise i won't let this go
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
And now you're off the rails
Your stupid ship has sailed
(whoa whoa)
I'm letting go
Whoa whoa, we had it all
Whoa whoa, we had it all
Chorus
Never answer again
Not to anyone
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
This road is all you'll have
All you'll ever know
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
I hope you realise i won't let this go
(whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
And now you're off the rails
Your stupid ship has sailed
(whoa whoa)
I'm letting go

And when I feel your touch
I never felt so loved
And with my eyes wide shut

Because

And if you need my lovin' now
I will never let you down

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel your touch
I never felt so loved

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love

Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue

I'm addicted to you!

To you, to you, to you
I'm addicted to you!
To you, to you, to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted to you!
To you, to you, to you
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this, bitch!
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?)
'Cause a hoe's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?)
'Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the Glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some
I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the flow ho
But they can't hang with my type og swing
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With he tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung
Bitches ain't shit

[Verse 1]
One of us gotta be serious, serious
One of us needs to be serious, serious
One of us gotta be serious, serious
I need no time to think about this

You give your all, do everything you can
My navigation must be off

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me that you've changed
Yet you still show up the same
Boy, you tell me that you'd never do that thing again
Turn for the worst, dead end

[Chorus]
It's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
'Til somebody show up lookin', lookin' for their love
It's all fun and games 'til it all goes left
Now you leaning on the door 'cause you can't take no more
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
You've defrosted everything, now nothing works
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets close
And the one you lost, you love the most

[Verse 2]
What do you want me to tell you?
What do you want me to say?
Baby, what else can I show you?
I've shown you in every way
Have you lost your mind? Lost your mind? (Huh?)
Who you think I am, think I am? (Huh?)
You ain't gonna be wastin' my time, wastin' my time (Huh?)
When we both know you don't give a damn, no (Huh?)

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me that you've changed
Yet you still show up the same
Boy, you tell me that you'd never do that thing again
Turn for the worst, dead end

[Chorus]
It's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
'Til somebody show up lookin', lookin' for their love
It's all fun and games 'til it all goes left
Now you leaning on the door 'cause you can't take no more
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
You've defrosted everything, now nothing works
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets close
And the one you lost, you love the most

[Bridge]
See, it's the kind of guys like you
That make the girls wanna fight you, yeah
I know I said I love everything about you
But no problem, through with you

[Pre-Chorus]
But you told me that you've changed
Yet you still show up the same
Boy, you tell me that you'd never do that thing again
Turn for the worst, dead end

[Chorus]
It's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
'Til somebody show up lookin', lookin' for their love
Yeah, t's all fun and games 'til it all goes left
Now you leaning on the door 'cause you can't take no more
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
You've defrosted everything, now nothing works
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets close
And the one you lost, you love the most
(Ain't nobody playin')
It's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt
'Til somebody show up lookin', lookin' for their love
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til it all goes left
Now you leaning on the door 'cause you can't take no more
Yeah, it's all fun and games 'til somebody gets hurt

Everything would be okay
You looked into my eyes
And all that I could see was me
And everything that is is everything you said it would be

[Pre-Chorus]
And things go up, and things fall down

And all the imperfections in this world created a perfect us
If you want I'll take a bending knee

Soaking in these memories of us
Full of highs, we're standing low
I wanna see this through 'til the end
Until my eyes close

And things go up, and things fall down

And all the imperfections in this world created a perfect us
If you want I'll take a bending knee
And look right in your eyes

You're always on my mind

[Chorus]
Baby, I'd propose you

Yo! What's popping? Hello, world—as I usually say, hahaha. My name is ... It's not important. What's more important is what I told y'all, and what I told y'all was—on Tha Carter 1, and everything else—I said, "I'm the best rapper alive," quote-unquote. And now, y'all believe me, haha. And since '05, The Dedication has been in your life. Tha Carter has been in your life. Gangsta Grillz has been in your life. So: The game has existed before us. But it was never the same after us, hahaha. Don't you agree? Well, without further ado, I'ma shut the fuck up. And we gon' get into this trilogy. Dedication 3, baby, yeah! Welcome!
Cigarette between her fingers
And a drink in her hand
She thought about the days
When her looks were still in demand
And wondered where the time had gone
When did everything go wrong

No more flowers at her door
No more phone calls to wait up for

And she just wanted to die
But it was easier, it was easier
To cry, cry
To cry, cry

Remembered fingers running through her hair as she wept
Got up to fix another drink
And cursed the memory she kept
When Jack would ease her heavy heart
And Jim would keep her from the dark
Woke up in her clothes and she smiled
And said romance was out of style
She just wanted to die
But it was easier, it was easier
To cry, cry
To cry, cry

They’re just tears for the cause
Tracks for the lost
Betrayed by the heart
Waiting for sorrow to dissolve

But it’s so easy to
It's so easy to
...
To cry, cry x5

Amy
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely even know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
For a bunch of fools drown in shame
Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs
But it never really kept you safe
You're too young for the golden age
Cause the record bin's been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
Is your heart singing out of tune
Are you eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep

[Verse 1]
Truth is not a thing you require
The naked truth is all I desire
I've seen enough to know I've seen too much
And now you're only adding fuel to the fire

[Chorus]
Words can't save us
Sometimes you got to kiss and make up
We argue but it ain't gon' break us
Put on some make-up, ladies
Just so you can kiss and make up
This ain't for everybody
This ain't for everybody, everybody
Go on and kiss and make up
And when it's real, you know you just can't fake love
Go on and kiss and make up

[Post-Chorus]
Not I do, at your body
Too real, can't knock me
This ain't for everybody
This ain't for everybody
That's how you know it's really love

[Verse 2]
Loving you it ain't easy, you see
Love is something you got to be
Nobody else should ever come between whatever
Goes on between you and me

[Chorus]
And when words can't save us
Sometimes you got to kiss and make up
We argue but it won't break us
Put on some make-up, ladies
Just so you can kiss and make up
This ain't for everybody
This ain't for everybody, everybody
Go on and kiss and make up
And when it's real, you know you just can't fake love
Go on and kiss and make up

[Post-Chorus]
Not I do, at your body
Too real, can't knock me
This ain't for everybody
This ain't for everybody
That's how you really know it's love

[Bridge]
I've been waiting, arms open wide
And then you came into my life
And gave me new love (Gave me new love)
A love that I need (A love that I need)
Even when things are not easy
It's not like we gon' separate (Separate)
'Cause what we have is sealed by fate
It's unbreakable (Unbreakable)
So unshakable (Unshakable)
And it can't be no other way

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody
This ain't for everybody, everybody
Go on and kiss and make up
And when it's real, you know you just can't fake love
Go on and kiss and make up

[Outro]
Not I do, at your body
Too real, can't knock me
This ain't for everybody
This ain't for everybody, everybody
That's how you know it's really love
Now take a girl and a boy
Strolling through the park
Come on and pour them together

Turn up the room til it gets hot
Two hands joined together beautiful weather for

Encouraging you to devote
Your life to something more cause there is so much more
So throw all of your doubts and fears away
Should have done it by now anyway
Can’t do nothing bout yesterday
So just dance and rejoice

[Chorus]
I want you to lift your hand move your feet and start to dance
Happiness is not by chance it’s your choice
There is no wrong way to be you
Move your feet and do this too
Don’t resist the joy lets rejoice
Special
Oh oh oh oh lets rejoice

[Verse 2]
Think about all you’ve overcome
All the battles and all the victories won
Why not stop and have some fun just dance and rejoice

Happiness is not by chance its your choice
There is no wrong way to be you
Now Move your feet and do this too

Special oh oh oh
Writer(s): Antonio Carlos Jobim

Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go? Oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and to me

Oh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, Oh my Dindi
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing Dindi, Happy Dindi, When you're with me

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my Dindi
Can't find the sea that would be me without you Dindi

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my Dindi

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

[Bridge]
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular (Whoo!)
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular, oh
This summer's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
My song is a serious matter
It reflects what I feel
If I say I love you, I mean it
'Cause in my song every line is for real

Every man or woman
Enjoys going home to a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications

Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong

[Chorus]
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

Music is love and my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when I sing, I have sung all about
The love of you and me
I never got angry with my guitar
'Cause when I strike a chord it gives me what I wanna hear
So I'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together, my dear

Outside answers should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved and never hidden

I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

I'm a stay fresh all day, all night, somethin' like 24/7
On my momma, I'm a pull up
Hop out with two of them Top Models
Haters gon' hate, but before the ice grill, say, 'Stop
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels'

[Verse 1]
They'll say it's bizack for the first time
Young boy rhyme like '87 Rakim, locked in my own world
No fire hydrant can water down me though
I'm a tyrant on Swizz beats, it's kind of ironic
Roll up the chronic tree, Hennessy, let's see, can you get like me?
White tee, L.A. fitted, roamin' the backstreet
Back trunk, chopper clap back at me
Girls get skeet-skeet on like Little John
BME, I don't save 'em, even with coupons
Usually I kick game like modern-day Bruce Lee
Raw heat, never paranoid when ridin' on deep-dish rims
Fly as Clark Kent, invade the black like a martian
Then say, 'Pardon me, no, pardon my arrogance
If you don't learnt else about I
Then, motherfucker, you better know this'

[Hook]

On my momma, you want to look at my wheels, huh?
On my momma, you want to know how it feel, huh?
To get like me, makin' them dollar bills, huh?
Pull up, hop out wit' my appeal, huh?
On my momma, she lookin' to pop a pill, huh?
On my momma, she lookin' to get a thrill, huh?
She want to go home, get that punani killed, huh?
Face down, ass up, she know the drill, huh?
I got a couple of soldiers ready to ride, huh?
It pop off the club, we finna leave outside, huh?
We see you duckin' and dodgin', flippin' to hide, huh?
On my momma, you play 'round and lose your life, huh?
I'm funky-fresh all night, huh?
Smokin' that chronic, high as a kite, huh?
Drinkin' that brown bottle on site, huh?
Been pimpin', baby, swear I don't lie, huh?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels

You ain't got to front, homie
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels
Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels
I said, 'You ain't got to front, homie'
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels
Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels
I ain't gon' lie 'bout it

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, how the fuck a nigga gon' try tell me?
'Bout the motherfucking ice that I'm rocking
'Bout these motherfucking bitches that I'm fucking
And sucking and putting them in a bucket, then
Beat that pussy up like it's the twelveth round
Up in niggas' towns with my Zoe Pounds
I don't go around since it come around
Wet diamonds in my mouth, if I kiss her she drown
If I leave a nigga white t-shirt red, it'll be a peppermint or a baseball, nigga
I know they sick and tired of hearing 'bout my jewelry
But if it fall on the ground, yeah, you might just slip and fall, nigga
She a shark, she like a jaws nigga
Your bitch says she wants a tall nigga
You are one midget you too small, nigga (Let 'em)
She suck my dick and rub my balls, nigga

Nigga, you be cuffing with no ties, nigga (She not yours)
Twin dimes and they mine, fold 'em like a pork rind
I know bloods that rock burgundy, no wine (Trrah)
Told that nigga best believe I'ma stay for real
In the back of the car screaming, "YSL, hold it down"
Yeah, hold it down 'til he come back off on an appeal
That's the real deal
I'ma eat that pussy down, then I'ma roll up some kush straight out the fields
I told her straight to her face if she don't do it, I know someone that will
You know the deal
I don't want to drink no lean with these niggas if it's not double sealed
And that's the real
Nigga, big B, balling, no budget
And my car is rare like a mullet (Skrrt-skrrt)
I've seen this bitch from up the stairs, she ain't ugly
Bitches bome up to my room and they get slutty
Bitches ball me Jeff and the F stand for fuckin'
One more time for my jewelry, yes, it's flooded (Woo)
Take that dick up out her coochie, then I butt it
All these niggas with me Blooded like we cutted (SooWoo)

[Chorus]
Nigga, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
I remember on the block I was serving them dimes, yeah
How the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?

What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker
What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Nowadays it's silly, niggas beef for nothing
The type of shit that make the hippies throw up peace for nothing
Back in my day, there wasn't silencers to hide the 8 up
So if it's beef, be sure to order side of baked potato
I've got amigos on my payroll, Quavo gave me guelo
Fuego, beef up on my plate is no mistake
Hahahahaha, check out the Chopard
For sure, I'm Shakur out the window of my car
Spitting at the cameras and I flood the club with dancers
I used to roll with hammers back when Sway had all the answers
Now it's spread like cancers in this German
And these niggas want me gone for certain
And that's what I call beef, you vermin

[Chorus]
What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker
What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Uh, Puffy swag combs, call me Sherlock Stallone
Daddy NASDAQ or call me Puffy Dow Jones
Come fuck with Puffy, dirty money since the scruffy Puffy
They want me bloody, hungry, ugly, crusty, musty Puffy
See that motherfucking phantom? Then it must be Puffy
It's like lately, all the ladies say is "fuck me, Puffy"
80 million records was projected
My leverage breaking records, it's like 80 women naked
Hectic, paranoia got me feeling threatened
So I'm loading up my weapons up like every other second

Woah, grab my syrup and my smoke, then lock and load

And all I want is a muthafuckin' cup full of H
She know not grab the cup when I pour up, no way
All my brodies know I'ma keep it funky like a egg

Geeked outta my mind, I'm geeked out

Old school cutlass with the T's out

Climax service in a tree house
If a nigga owe, then the fee house
Rich car service takin' me out
Baby pop Cris' while you naked
Me and mama ears on berguettes
I'ma still throw if she ain't worth it
I'ma keep goin' like a poet
Drank that pussy like Moet
Work on that dick, no surgery

[Verse]
Everybody, duck down, all you hear is the sound
Of Slim Shady spittin' rounds at the Lyricist Lounge
What year is this now? I don't know, I forgot
All I know is that I'd die for pot, make the cypher hot
Smoke weed and fuck up my life a lot
Give me the money now, bitch
Did you want to see your wife or not?
'Fore I stab her wit' this knife I got
I got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'
I got the Outsidaz up in this bitch
Peace to Thirstin' Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed wit' badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna step to this and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin' wit' your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, it hurts worth
When they get abolished, polyps'll murk worse
Wrote a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, hollerin', 'Nurse, nurse'
You said this shot would numb it, bitch, it just hurts worse
Rappers can't fuck wit' the way that I spit it, lyrical lit it
Now you did it when I committed, get his rhymes out here
Off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Fuck a team, I can stop you alone
Rappers don't understand it

[Snippet 1]
I'm back on my shit, man
They tell me, 'Be humble and cop the SL'
Shout out my bitches that answer my call
When I call to collect cause they got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
He made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up, then slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew...

[Snippet 2]
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talkin' 'bout work that I really put in
Talkin' 'bout pencils I put on my hip
And I'm talkin' 'bout foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove, really was charged in my hood
And these bitches I really did hit, twenty wit' shows
Came up from nothin' and...

[Snippet 3]
Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent
We laughin' like, 'She done been a ho'
Jumpin' out them Benzos, me, your bitch in a friend zone
She told you I was friend zoned, what? I'm in the end zone
Touchdown wit' the two, bring her virgin
Give her that dick long, she bustin' like they...

[Snippet 4]
Jump out the 'Rari, then jump out the (-)
I hop in my (-), then hop in some (-)
And jump out the (-) and jump out the (-)
Man, I go stackin' this money, oh, (-)

[Snippet 5]
Then the Gucci and Louis, we was under (-)
2012, when we did the (-), my (-) was cool
When you lil' niggas was worried 'bout drugs
We was rockin' on 'Ludes, I got the loosest, now I done (-)
Hit wit' they chopper, now pray down to (-)

[Snippet 6]
And, yeah, I been losin' touch wit' my family, it ain't the same
I should have gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should have hit the crib wit' my son and played the game
But instead I ended up at the jeweler to make a chain
This is sayin', sayin' when you make money, it make you change

[Snippet 7]
And these niggas get to talkin' like they know me
Finna turn me to the old me
Should've listened to my mama when she told me
Now these bitches throwin' pussy cause they owe me
I got the juice, nigga, I got the juice
Nigga, I got the juice when they hop out the coupe

[Snippet 8]
When they fuck wit' you, don't take my picture, nigga
Pops was on the corner, wit' a .40 on my hip, Godzilla
Where's gettin' to it when they hit my nigga, Dean
'Less the shit got realer
Eyes on the South Side, really outside, got guns, got killers

[Snippet 9]
Here today, gun-butt a nigga wit' the end of the K
Kick it in your ass, insinuate
Then come around here like your niggas' is safe
Cause all my haters goin', 'Brr', speak 'em
Fuck is you winnin', man?
Miss money and murder, you fuck wit' my niggas
You come to my city, I fucked all them bitches

[Snippet 10]
The money and the power, the money and the power
Fuckin', fuckin' up a cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque
Cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque
Cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque
These bitches fuckin' for a cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque
Cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque
Cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque, cheque
Look, look, look at all these young niggas fightin' for a...

[Snippet 11]
Pussy, and just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley don't make you thorough
Pussy, still hatin' in front of my city
I'm thankin' this day, for real
'Pussies' could sound like I says, 'Kill'
You comin' like Navy Seals
Just wait to my mama, I promised her Jordans

[Snippet 12]
They killed Chinx Drug in his own city
They killed Lil' Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
I don't know if niggas gon' clap for me or gon' kill me
Still livin' lavish and they wonder why I act savage
All these guns are automatics

[Intro]
I don't waste time wit' you fake kind
Hustle all day 'til it's playtime
Motherfucker, I'm a take mine, I'm a take mine
Cause ain't shit free, I'm a make mine

[Verse 1]
So many rumors through the grapevines, I could make wine
But last night was a good night, the great kind
I give a bitch sixty minutes, call it Dateline
Straight up and down, I'm a '80s baby, I smoke eight dimes
Look, I don't ask no questions, I don't wait for answers
Born in Cackalacky, but I'm so Atlanta
I want a freak bitch wit' good table manners
Half college girl, half table dancer
Who can see through all of these lies
She sees through all of this propaganda
Seen alcohol take lives and marijuana cure a lady's cancer
That's free publicity, ain't it? But it ain't no mystery, ain't it?
I work 24/7, nonstop, I think I deserve to be medicinally faded
I think I deserve to get wasted, I think I deserve a vacation
I spent a couple grips on this whip
Shit, I think I deserve to repaint it, fuck it

[Hook]
I don't waste time wit' you fake kind
Hustle all day 'til it's playtime
Motherfucker, I'm a take mine, I'm a take mine
Cause ain't shit free, I'm a make mine
'Member I'm a take mine, I'm a take mine
I'm a take mine for sure, motherfucker, I'm a take mine
I'm a take mine,  I'm a take mine cause ain't shit free
So I'm a make mine

[Bridge]
That's how you feel, that's how you feel
That's how you feel, that's how you feel
That's how you feel, that's how you feel
That's how you feel, that's how you feel

Hook

[Verse 2]
I find it funny you say you changed the game
But without the South, you wouldn't even have a lane
You'd still be average name, it don't take half a brain
But, see, i just stunt cause I want to
I don't even have to have a chain
I don't even have to have a (-)
I just throw these ones cause I want to
Niggas get mad at me
Cause this lifestyle I live is out of they budget
Well, I guess it's why they be grudgin'
I just grab my glasses, say, 'Fuck it'
Then I light that gas, tear that big old gal
Then put that ass in my bucket, I'm dippin'
And I tell 'em where I'm goin'
But wherever B.o.B at, it's some bad bitches for 'em
It's really just the norm
I don't even see the haters, I just learn to ignore 'em
Fuck a hip-hop forum, if I ain't on your list, I take no offense
Killin' every lane, y'all strugglin' to fit
I don't ever look back, I've been killin' ever since, that's clear

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

I keep kush like a Californian
That loud pack stankin' like a bag a funyuns
That loud pack will have a nigga missin' money
That strong purp, I guess the steroids the money

[Verse: Gucci Mane]

I keep kush like a Californian
That loud pack stankin' like a bag a funyuns
That loud pack will have a nigga missin' money
That strong purp, I guess the steroids the money
Traps move coke, Starbucks move coffee
I'm So Icey CEO so bitch get off me
My Girlfriend bossy but I'm her boss man
You working for the government like Mike Vick cousin
Juggalin, Juggin, jabbin and joggin
We keep that white girl I'm talkin Dolly Parton
X pills, Xanax, and Oxycontin
Lambos, Mazis, and Aston Martins
You steppin on my ma's reds, beg ya pardon?
Ya didn't say sorry bitch what's the problem?
So Icey jack boys want to rob him
But how a jack boy gonna rob the robba?
I got more protege's than a lot of mazdas
The So Icey boys betta call the coppas
Choppas, helicopters and patnas
Good weed, caviar, crab and lobster
I seen this bitch I told my dog to watch her
So thick I told my dog to sick her
X pills, iring, kush and liquor
They told van turn this thing up a little
I'm goin
I done stepped it up a little
It's snowin'
So icey make it rain ya drizzle
I'm focused
Ain't one of these average niggas
The Alligator, croc, gator chinchilla
Shawty on the radio but I don't fell em'
But if he say my name then he might fall a victim
So robbas in the club "Whys Gucci's wit em'?"
Cause Gucci gives a fuck
Gucci keep a pistol
Now as the dope bubbles and the cocaine sizzles
Shawty took a line it gave her ass the shivers
I gave her a skittle now she got the giiggles
I gave her two more now she sucked my pickle
I'm with her now with a million pills
If 12 hit this door we gettin a trillion years
I drink Rozay, Cris' and beer
Gotta brick gotta brick in my ring and ear
So Icey trap scholar 08' the year
My jewelry
Lights up like L.A. Gear
And if they pull this Hummer over imma get the chair
Stash spot brick tucked down in every-a-where
Chyea!
