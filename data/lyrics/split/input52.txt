Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Outro: Drake & Beyoncé]
Can I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

Tell me who the fuck you wanna be

Man I wish that I was there when that shit popped off (shit popped off)
And who would’ve thought (who would've thought)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city
They killed Lil Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
I don't know if niggas gon' clap for me or gon' kill me
Still living lavish and they still wonder why I act savage
All these guns and automatics
Still gonna murder these niggas that want to have it
Before they have me miss my son’s football practice
Fuck y’all niggas that killed Lil Snupe
And when we run in y’all niggas we gone kill y’all too
I still pray every young nigga feel that coupe
Cause young niggas feel like me, I feel like you
Fifty shades of grey, want to do me like Freddie
I pray to God, load my chopper, tell them niggas I’m ready
I’m riding 'round with my squad, it's Pmon and Omelly
I got Deen in the cut, my nigga Coon be so heavy
We got to make it back home tonight
So fuck the law, we brought the chrome tonight
'Cause the cops won’t save you, you alone tonight
So tell me young nigga am I wrong or right?

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Strap]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Sometimes I miss my dad, I wish he could see me now
Rolls Royce, he wouldn’t believe me now
The way I took my mom out the hood, got Tweety round
From the jects to the burbs, I wish you could meet me now
But you died before he was even 'round
But I set him straight though, look who he be around
In the sticks with the kids where they really play soccer
When he could’ve been a nigga on the corner with a chopper
You the one that taught me how to hold my hands 'fore they got you
So I’ma fight hard for the fam until they pop us, 'til they rock us
You ain’t even get to meet my son Papi
He’s three now, and he be asking where his grandpop is
You see now, they talk 'cause they don't see my fam shopping
Now see the brand new Benz and the brand new houses
Know you see these brand new friends, acting brand new, smiling
And I just got brand new bills, that’s brand new problems
And my old homie told on me, like damn you wyling
And that shit you talk from jail don’t scare nobody
'Cause you told, you dead now
And you know, nigga walk with your head down
RIP

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Fly high, so high, fly high, so high

[Intro: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you've done (Uh)
‘Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more, ah!

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood

You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off? (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Uh, uh)
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Bad blood)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut

'Cause that Indian got your back, girl (Yeah)

Stayed four songs, then she ran down me
Caught up with us, set plans on me (Yeah)

She didn't wanna fuck me (Why?), she wanna fuck my tattoos (Truly)

In the club with fifty hoes, ain't none one of them arguin' (They not)
Weed give me the munchies, might just eat tamale, I'm starvin
Give 'em Biggie, still ballin'
Shouts out to GM, free UnkFunk, G and Marley

[Chorus]
I guess I got your respect
'Cause that Indian got your back, girl (Yeah)
I want you to drop it low

[Verse 2]
I got hoes breathin' all over my dick like it's a heart (And what?)
I got tons of that weight livin' in my house like Bubba Sparxxx
Got a tall lightskinned ho that like to get tats, she a work of art
Got a bitch number in my phone
Don't call her phone 'less I need her card, oh
You flyin' with me, or you gon' stay with them?
Baby, use your head, you can't lay with them (Okay cool, you trippin')
Not a kid, baby play with 'em (Watch out)
That nigga, that boy say one assist, that's a pair of Timbs
And I'll miss you baby, I love you baby

And you know I was horny when I rubbed you, babe (Let's go)

I guess I got your respect
'Cause that Indian got your back, girl (Yeah)

And I'm ready to put me in the White House
Make me the President
I'm gonna move on my first act
I'm a, get me 2000 raggedy ass painters
To paint the muthafuckin' White House black
Dolomite for your president
I'ma legalize every muthafuckin' thing
Somebody ask me how do I stand on Marijuana
Very high baby, very high
How do I stand on prostitution
I don't stand on it, I lay on it
I'ma legalize sellin' pussy
Sell it, sell it, sell your pussy, girls
Pussy will sell, if pussy don't sell
Grits ain't gross and eggs ain't poultry
And Mona Lisa is a muthafuckin' man

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You used to fall through when I call like, "Baby what you need?"
Ask me, "Can I bring a friend? Do you got drinks? Wanna eat? Need weed?"
And now you act like you don't have the time again
When anything I'd ask you, you would find a way

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Don't you miss the way a nigga hit it? Sucking it and licking while I kiss it
Don't you miss the time we were spending? Baby, you was mine, you was with it
Where he got you hiding? Tryna find you babe
'Cause every time I'm calling, you decline me babe

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Oh, you ain't gotta tell me I know
We'll never be the same as before
But I can only tell you how I feel right now, I'm missing how you feel right now
You can call when you're man ain't around, I gotcha
Oh, how you gonna act like that? I just don't get it
Tell me does he do it, do you do it just like we did it?
Clock stop ticking, guess I ran out of minutes
I can hear your heart, is it saying that we've finished?
Girl we was the best, how could you
How could you, how could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
He must treat you good, bet he does
He must be the man I never was
No response, no reply, every time I try to get through
So when you hear this on the radio, it's about you

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Don't you miss the way a nigga hit it? Sucking it and licking while I kiss it
Don't you miss the time we were spending? Baby, you was mine, you was with it
Where he got you hiding? Tryna find you babe
'Cause every time I'm calling, you decline me babe

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Pusha T]
Oh, you ain't gotta tell me I know
We'll never be the same as before
But I can only tell you how I feel right now, I'm missing how you feel right now
You can call when you're man ain't around, I gotcha
Oh, how you gonna act like that? I just don't get it
Tell me does he do it, do you do it just like we did it?
Clock stop ticking, guess I ran out of minutes
I can hear your heart, is it saying that we've finished?
Girl we was the best, how could you
How could you, how could you forget?
How could you forget?
How soon we forget
How could you forget?
We can't be over
How could you forget?
He gon' ask who taught you that

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
You never did this before, you wasn't hittin' ignore
I had you tendin' on shores
You got the man, is you sure?
You got the man is you sure?
He don't know you like I know you
He don't know like you like them hoes too, he's not supposed to
You was experimentin', we was just tryin' shit
That's just what young bitches go through
I made you pretty, you was just hopeful
I was like Diddy, you were my Total
You were my Cassie, you was just local
Showed you the world, I made you global

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Oh, you ain't gotta tell me I know
We'll never be the same as before
But I can only tell you how I feel right now, I'm missing how you feel right now
You can call when you're man ain't around, I gotcha
Oh, how you gonna act like that? I just don't get it
Tell me does he do it, do you do it just like we did it?
Clock stop ticking, guess I ran out of minutes
I can hear your heart, is it saying that we've finished?
Girl we was the best, how could you
How could you, how could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?

Shots got my head spinning round and round, round and round
How many drinks will it take me to get you alone babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause a girl like you deserves affection when we're sexing
It's a blessing that you came so when you come through

Baby, we've been kicking it all night, we've been vibing, it just feels right
So if you ain't got nothing else to do, or if you cool with it, I just, you should come chill with a nigga
Hop up in the car, we ain't gotta go far
I know you wanna go, girl, come chill
And I've been kissing on your neck
Rubbing on your thighs, don't it feel right?
And now I got you thinking what, what if you give it up?
Would he tear that pussy down? Bet he beat that pussy up
Grabbing all that booty, still it's cute he thinking butt
Mind like probably but that body saying yup
She say come on, so we gon', we gon' play the crib
And if tomorrow never came, she can say she did
I got her literally feeling a nigga
So glad she came to chill with a nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm all alone in this big old house
Think I'm 'bout to watch a movie, all my friends went out
And the pool's feeling good, it's just the right temp'
Don't remember the last time I even got in, I think what I need is

Company to comfort me, you call at the right time
Fun for you is fun for me, we are such a good time

Give me lil kiss, we gon' make a little flick

Ladies and Gentlemen
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare...the band fanfare because...ladies and gentlemen...sting has always gone ahead of itself
They have done it again and again and again
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten thousand fire sides
And if you know...and if you enjoy hip-hop...if you want one of the coldest brothaz out of North America...a brotha that gave you a song like
Juicy...

[Biggie]
Uh-huh...

[Jamaican Host]
You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this
"Who the heck is this
Paging me in the morning
At the crack of dawning"

[Biggie]
Yeauh!

[Jamaican Host]
Please welcome...for the first time...in Sting 96...Please welcome (welcome...welcome)

[Verse 1]
Girl it's been about three weeks
Since you came to see me
I get it, I get it, you ain't ready tryna fall
But damn, you could answer my calls, damn
No matter how long it takes
Girl you know, girl you know
No matter how far you try to run away
I'll be close, I'ma let you up in

[Chorus]
These thoughts of mine
Who you've been giving all your time?
Girl a love like mine is hard to find
And you, you give me such a hard time
Girl, tonight it's gon' be all mine, all mine
And I'm on it you gon' wake up like, "Damn he gave me a hard time"
Hard time, hard hard, hard, hard times
Hard, hard times, hard, hard times

[Verse 2]
It done been about three weeks
Since I had your knees weak
Said you were coming back, coming back, what happened to that?
Is it too good, did I hit it too good? I made you run from that
You gon' take it all, make you shake and shiver 'cause you be acting fickle all
I'ma make you ride it like a bicycle
When you say you coming through, won't you come?
'Cause every time you come through, don't you cum?

[Chorus]
Ooh, these thoughts of mine
Who you've been giving all your time?
Girl a love like mine is hard to find
And you, you give me such a hard time
Girl, tonight it's gon' be all mine, all mine
And I'm on it you gon' wake up like, "Damn he gave me a hard time"
Hard time, hard hard, hard, hard times
Hard, hard times, hard, hard times

[Verse 3]
It done been about three weeks, that's 500 hours, since I had you in the club with the bottles
Man, I swear we stunting out all to the crib, tub, shower
D'usse in our system, that's when you say you gon' go down
And I can't let you do that all alone, I'ma go down
Like lalalala lalalalalala
Tongue kissing on your lips that's way down below
Girl, let me be your sex hero
I'm just letting you know

[Chorus]
These thoughts of mine
Who you've been giving all your time?
Girl a love like mine is hard to find
Why you, you give me such a hard time
Girl, tonight it's gon' be all mine, all mine
And I'm on it you gon' wake up like, "Damn he gave me a hard time"
Hard time, hard hard, hard, hard times
Hard, hard times, hard, hard times

[Outro]
It done been about 3 weeks
It done been about 3 weeks
It done been about 3 weeks

[Verse 1]
How can I love someone I never touched?
You lived under the water, but I love you so much
You never been on land, and you never seen the sky
You don't know what a cloud is
Why does everything I love have to die?
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be
But I couldn't let that be
By keeping you small, by keeping you safe
If I could do it again, I'd release you to sea
'Cause I can't bear to see something so wild just die in a tank

[Chorus 1]
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so much
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

[Verse 2]
On Saturday night, we all went out to eat
But I can never decide, so someone chose sushi
I got soup, and I ordered rice
But watching my friends eat my friends, ruined my appetite

[Chorus 2]
Oh, Pablow the blowfish
If they only knew you like I do
They'd love you too
And Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

[Verse 3]
I won't forget, even one second we had
'Cause you might be gone, but you could never be dead
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie
I heard she was quite the lady
Maybe you'll find her and you could make babies
That'd be kind of crazy

[Bridge]
If Pablow the blowfish
Found love deep in the sea
Then that would mean
Pablow the blowfish
Is better off than here with me

[Outro]
But Pablow the blowfish
I miss you so bad

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Bridge]
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat, man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this, it just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat, man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

[Chorus]
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Outro]
Ooh, man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex, yeah
Ice cold with the flex
Hahaha, that shit hard

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing 'cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy 'cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start

[Verse 1]
This reminds you, that you can't go wrong for knowing
But they talking like they don't know and all of 'em sound the same
They're so quick to judge someone, but they thought of me different before
Guess I'm absolved from now, guess what they say

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing 'cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy 'cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start

[Verse 2]
So does this define you? Do you really believe what they say?
I didn't think so, but they talking like you acting strange
They're so quick to judge someone and it's really, really getting old
Plus I'm so numb now, but they say...

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing 'cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy 'cause I wanna do it my way
I bet you think that I'll fly away from you, but I wouldn't do that
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh
Let's take it back to the start

[Bridge]
Do, oh-oh-oh
If you do, oh-oh-oh
If you do, oh-oh-oh
Yes, you do, oh-oh-oh
That you do, oh-oh-oh
That you do, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
That you do, oh woah, oh, woah

[Chorus]
They say I'm changing (Now) 'cause they all doing the same thing
I bet you think that I'll fly away (Now) from you, but I wouldn't do that
Now they're saying I'm crazy (Hey) 'cause I wanna do it my way (Hey)
I bet you think that I'll fly away (Hey) from you, but I wouldn't do that (Hey)
Let's take it back to the start, oh-oh

Beat the case in my case any day

[Chorus]
Fuck a nigga bitch, that's all
Grabbin' on my dick, that's all
Stuntin' with my bitch, that's all

She fuckin' all my buddies, that's all

[Verse 1]
She fuckin' all my buddies
I might love fuckin' it, but I just cannot love it
I might catch a nigga bitch and fuck her right on Gresham
Bitch, I am a monster, I know I am a lil' ugly
I might pull up with all of my jewelry on like Busta
Got a unique body, my clothes, get 'em from Russia
I might pull up and pimp that bitch just like a sucka
I don't give no fuck about these lil' shrimps, I got my mustard, ketchup, nigga
Nigga loaded pimpin', pimp tight, game right
I might eat it, I might beat it like Mike Ikes
Treat that pussy Tempur-Pedic and call it a night
She compliment on my fly and ain't talking no flight
And therefore I love her
She make a nigga shine without using butter
My partner in crime, she won't tell like her mother
We don't want no one other, we got one another
She know I got her, we got each other
She know I'ma grip her weave when I fuck her
She know I'ma go over C's like a Blood
Hey, baby, my name Jeff and Mudd

I got me a K in this place
Baby, don't play in this place

Might pull up relaxed and dressed in Toms, nigga

You know my cup is pink, like bubblegum, nigga

[Bridge 2]
Easter pink, pussy wetter than a sink (Drippin')

[Intro: Andy Samberg]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk

[Hook 1: Jimmy Fallon]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
Cause you only live once

Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy
Ugh, you only live once
That's the motto
So take a chill pill
Ease off the throttle

Never go to loud clubs
Cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear
And stay the hell away from drugs
Cause they're not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle

Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus
Boat or by rail

And don't travel by plane
And don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement
With titanium walls

And wear titanium suits
In case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas
Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas

And never take the stairs
Cause they're often unsafe
You only live once
Don't let it go to waste

[Hook 2: Jimmy Fallon]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat til it's done
Cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Jorm, Kiv, & Andy]
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice:
Stay away from kids
Cause their hair is filled with mad lice

There's no such thing
As too much Purell
This a cautionary tale
Word to George Orwell

So don't 1980 force
Any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt
And triple lock it

Then hire a taster
Make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy
Then destroy him

No blankets or pajamas
They can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture:
Killing machines

Board your windows up
The sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straight jacket
So you're safe from yourself

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Uh huh, yeah
Gotta get your money right mind right
And by the year 2020 like hindsight
You could have your portfolio diversified like
Stocks and bonds and hustles on the side right
A bunch to buy a bunch of crazy-ass nonsense
You wake up in the morning Fabergé egg omelets
That's money and then some
To spend some and lend some
It's disposable income
You only live once, right?

[Bridge: All]
YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
Also stands for YOLO

[Hook 3: Jimmy Fallon]
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

[Outro: All]
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out

[Intro]
Thugger
Alex engineering right now

Uhh, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, woah

[Chorus]
I can't get beside myself
Remain the person that I am, I can't disguise myself
If that lil' baby can cook, I might just try my chef
I swear to God they rape me I will buy myself
No 80's, I cook babies for my goddamn health
I give my love to you and my son named Jeff
I flood you with them jewels, yeah, that water like Phelps
I wish you never knew nothing 'bout myself
Cause you know I got that tool right beside my belt
Bitch, I'm looking at you, I can't hide myself
You know I got them racks stacked up like a shelf
I promise I won't stop until I find myself
I got way to the top and yes, I climbed myself
That fuck nigga think he cool, I'ma iron him myself
I did a song with Dej Loaf and I tried her myself
And if she ever say yes, I'ma dive in myself (Whishhh)

[Verse 1]
If I walk in on it, I'm stoppin' in the back
I just bought a mink rabbit, not jack, not a rat
I got rings, yes, 6, no Pat
Starin' at my jewelry end up blind like a bat
Like her pants halfway down, I got muhfuckin' crack
Hey, I got muhfuckin' crack
I might ride with my Crips, they say muhfuckin' clack
Lookin' over my shoulder at all these ants like where they at?
Bleed, bleed, bleed
I'm a player, I got tricks up my muhfuckin sleeve (Whoa)
Today I am with Jay-Z like B
I'll make it storm if one dollar land on me
I'ma boss, I nutted on her forehead (Boss)
If she ever stop, I need some more head (Boss)
I be ridin' fast, gettin' that slow head
Cut down her woods, I got that mow head

[Chorus]
I can't get beside myself
Remain the person that I am, I can't disguise myself
If that lil' baby can cook, I might just try my chef
I swear to God they rape me I will buy myself
No 80's, I cook babies for my goddamn health
I give my love to you and my son named Jeff
I flood you with them jewels, yeah, that water like Phelps
I wish you never knew nothing 'bout myself

That fuck nigga think he cool, I'ma iron him myself
I did a song with Dej Loaf and I tried her myself
And if she ever say yes, I'ma dive in myself

[Interlude]
Dive in, that lil pussy (Yaahh!)
Douche it, all types of tushy (Yaahh!)
And I need napkins, pussy wet it, need some napkins
And Baptist

[Verse 2]
'Mote control that pussy, come here pussy, come here
Make that pussy sit up like we fuck with a belt
2016 Rover, now we callin' it here
Fucked all of those cats, so yeah, we doggin' in here
That Bentley got brown wood like a Spalding in here
I got a million outfits, you can go shoppin' in here
And if you hatin', 9 times outta 10, you floppin' this year
Hey, screaming "Flex" just like Flocka in here
I'm a beast, I'm a beast, I'm a goddamn beast
All these fuck niggas hatin' but don't feast like these
I'm a boss, bitch I'm Sosa on like Chief Keef on this
I got rich, Papi shoulda told you to be like me
I swear I'm bleedin' so bad, I just said, "Be like me"
She bought a cat, I bought a Jag, I told her be like me
I got a, big bag like I went shopping
I'm not a police, but I got copies, ya dig

[Chorus]
I can't get beside myself
Remain the person that I am, I can't disguise myself
If that lil' baby can cook, I might just try my chef
I swear to God they rape me I will buy myself
No 80's, I cook babies for my goddamn health

That fuck nigga think he cool, I'ma iron him myself
I did a song with Dej Loaf and I tried her myself
And if she ever say yes, I'ma dive in myself

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I see your pockets getting chubby, get a loan from me
Don't leave your bitch alone in the room with me
Tying rope or comatose her in a coma, homie

The money greener than the reefer Wiz Khalifa showed me
I'm up in London smoking skunky with some (real niggas only)

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard niggas hatin' on me from the sideline, mm, nice try
Can't see you niggas anyway, two bitches standing on my pride

[Verse]
Psycho, psychopathic man, loaded ammunition in his hand
They froze, he blows, blows
Another lost soul from the city full of lost hope
Where they go, who knows?
But I could bet my bottom dollar
It was over somethin' like money, cash, hoes, they clothes
But I could bet my bottom dollar
Down to my last penny heaven won't accept his soul
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life
My pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life
My pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
You like to think you're never wrong Forfeit the game
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone Forfeit the game
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you Forfeit the game
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live - what - you've learned)

[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD

[Intro: Young Thug]
We got London on da track
Same damn time, ayy
Oh, no need to cuff it or buff it
When you fuck sisters and cousins at like the same damn time

To me that shit is disgusting, no, no, no, they ain't my kind
No, no, no, they ain't my kind
Pass the basketball, I'm a player

Hell, girl, I want you all to myself

[Verse: Young Thug]
If you got AIDS, I want it
If you got herpes, I want it

She say she gon' suck it and she gon' do it today
She, she up all night and she just want the D
I pick her up and drop her right back off
Hey, I'm bangin' red like hot sauce
No Olympian, I got O's though
And I might feature this bitch with Trey Songz, no

[Chorus: Young Thug & Ayanis]
Nobody, she don't want nobody, and I guarantee
She don't want nobody, she don't want nobody and I guarantee
She don't want nobody, she don't want nobody and I guarantee
She don't want nobody, not even me and I guarantee
And I guarantee, not even me and I guarantee
I said, not even me and I guarantee

[Outro: Young Thug]
And I guarantee
I, I, I leave, but I come right back home to you
I, I, I go get the paper and bring it straight home to you

Prayin' to the trap god that this boss don't get knocked, hopefully

No this not my fetish bitch, but I got ice all over me
Extendo make my pants sag lower than they 'posed to

When a brick was twenty-six, it got me goddamn rich
Taught me how to flip a pack and move them goddamn bricks
Boy if you ain't gettin' no money, go hit a goddamn lick
I rep 12 and 22nd for my niggas slanging bricks
It's ZooWap from the bando, boy this ain't what you want
Rubber grip on my handle, I crush your ass for fun
Not anywhere I can't go, I pull up where I want
Anything is on the counter it's like Fetty tryna stunt
Everyone in my camp go, four others got a gun
Don't you think that we're lackin', the chopper's in the trunk
Hear that shit when it's blastin', I love the way it dump
Used to sleep in the trap house, wake up next to my gun

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope

You can't beat me, like Kobe come through in the clutch
If you look out once or blink your eye, I'll pack two
Shakin' baby syndrome, I got these rappers so shook
My pops wasn't 'round, but least he gave me good looks
Drop head Phantom, the top down, my rims up
I got cash on me, a nigga stash for me
So I don't need your weed, I got a line on tweed
I got a plug on Ps, I got a plug on lean
I got a Colt 15, I got an M16
I got a bullshit charge, that bitch that lied on me
Tattoos on my face card cause I don't want no job

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm too much, I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up

[I don't give a damn, you got me fucked up](7145292)

I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up
I don't give a damn, you got me fucked up
Bitch can get past me cause she lucked up
Let her have a baby by Wop, she lucked up

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Kush smells like root beer, my career just hit 5th gear
Now I make you bitches, haters disappear
I only made 4 million last year
30K a day, diamonds on display
Ridin' in somethin' I can't pronounce
Put a trampoline in my backyard
Just to watch them titties bounce
My rubies rocky and rounded
You are at home, grounded
I might install a Versace money counter
Next to my codeine fountain
They say all I talk about is money
That's all that I think about
I have no idea who you are
My front yard has bodyguards
RiFF!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm too much, I talk trash, bitches say I'm stuck up

Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad
I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad'
And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bang

[Hook: Lady Gaga]
Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ah, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption
That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite
I'll still run with pleasure
Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil
Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bang

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Prepare, I descend from the East, my name is Lady Gaga

Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar
We party nauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high

Roleplay, we could stop the role play, everyone left
I'm making love to his girl, but he's still my nigga
No, we can't control ourselves when we on that liquor

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derülo]
Can't look the homie in his eyes 'cause I'm in love with his girl

[Outro]
Slow it down on 'em
I just want my ex to see, to see you baby, but first

Better believe that you saved me
Baby, your angel wings, fly somewhere where there is means (your angels, always been)
Baby, your angel wings, girl I just want my ex to see you (angel wings)

[Intro]
Ay, I have a message from the Most High that says:
"This negra kept his soul from the Devil."
It's true, I guess I mean, wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ign'ant? Really? Really?

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My entire sound is how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope

[Break: A$AP Rocky]
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord
(These things are not right, these things is not right) Lord
(Hell, nobody's ever defined) Lord
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who's more important than your Lord and Savior?
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably due to all your poor behavior
My mental got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh
Let's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major
Ha, I got my own relationship with God, Lord

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees

[Verse 1]
Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are"

[Verse 2]
They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are (Just be as you are)"
Be as you are (Whoa)
Be as, be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as you are
(Be as you are) Be as, be as you are

[Bridge]
If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
'Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26
I spoke to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are (Be as you are)"
Be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as, be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as you are (Be as you are)
Be as, be as you are
Be as you are

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day (Hustle)
I hustle every day in life, thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block, them older niggas said I couldn't (hustle)
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped backpack
Bitch, I'm flippin' work, hand in hand, I think they call it track (hustle)
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (hustle)
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (uhh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it

[Chorus: BONES]
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same (hustle)
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to (hustle)
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit

[Chorus: BONES]
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

Now we finna go off in the buildin' (Yeah)
I could really give a fuck about your feelings (Yeah)
Used to be a schoolboy and a rude boy too
Not a jerk like the New Boyz, groovin' like ScHoolboy Q, nigga
I done killed a few boys, nigga (Yeah)
Down a couple shots, turn it up another notch
Got a bitch that's in the spot and she faded (Yeah)
Corset top with the new ass shots
Couple Instagram likes, now she famous (Yeah)
Nose job, workin' on some payments (Yeah)
On a new car, now she finna trade it (Yeah)
Next time, you shouldn't've sucked a nigga dick for free
Man, I swear the smart girls are my favorite (Yeah)
Oh, my God, your cable's turned off
You shouldn't have sucked the nigga's dick for free
Brand new 'Rari, finna race it (Yeah)
I am not the nigga you should play with (Yeah)
This year, I turned it into the racist (Yeah)
All I wanna see is green faces (Whoo)
All I wanna count is green numbers (Yeah)
Man that shit is weird, lookin' like the Matrix (Yeah)
Gave 'em HiiiPower, Always Strive And Prosper
Only took a little bit of patience (Whoo)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high
She clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, she drop it low-ow-ow
Then she clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, down to the floor-or-or
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yeah, ever seen a crib like this?
Diamonds in my ear like wrists
Pull off at the light like, "Wuh"
Lookin' like a mil' in that trunk
Two-seater got me lookin' all clumped
Hit a nigga wig on sight (Sight)
Serve a nigga mom off white (White)
I'ma get her so high, I'm Christ
Nigga, ball so hard like Mike
I could whip that bitch like Ike
I can fuck your bitch off hype
Pink ring, got bling all bright
How a hot nigga rock this ice?
14, almost got that strike
14, almost did that time
14, had a .905
Clip small, but the shit shoot fine
Shoot a spine, make a nigga recline
Start sparkin', a nigga go blind
G Rides, hoppin' out of Nissans
Do I got them hoes chirpin'? Yeah, uhh
Do I put the work in? Yeah
Do I got them hoes out workin'? Yeah
Do I make 'em put the work in the Birkin? Yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Shorty she like to pop ass high
Popped her way up to first class high
She clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, she drop it low-ow-ow
Then she clap-clap-clap-clap-clap, down to the floor-or-or
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)
Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)

[Outro: Joe Fox]
Ohh, memories
Ohh, memories
Ohh, memories
Ohh, memories
We've got electric body, we found ourselves the perfect way
Ohh, memories
We've got electric body, never gonna be alone
Ohh, memories
We've got electric body, we found ourselves the perfect way
Ohh, memories
We've got electric body, we've got electric body
Ohh, memories
We've got electric body, we've got electric body

[Part I]

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but who will lean if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, "Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo' ass is acting"
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo' ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Part II]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead, bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the "love" word

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's good
Oh shit
Mushrooms, LSD, marijuana
Light that shit
Oh shit

[Verse]
This is every heavy drug, that's known at every level
This assault with deadly metal bumpin' heavy metal
Do this for myself, across my hood and every ghetto
Paper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal
It's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel
Time is money, so I saved the load on every bezel
I just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow
I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow
Let go back to business, my fits Prada for my Devil
Cause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos
Flacko jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits
I hypnotized my Sig, but my .38 was kinda special
What a life this is, what a sight this is
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white persons
All alike when the lights get dim
On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sip it

[Outro]
I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen
Harmony, love, drugs, and peace is all we need
Harmony, love, drugs, and peace is all we need

[Intro]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I'm moving...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim
Raw dogs, you other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head is so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

[Chorus: Acyde]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uhh, Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty
Any foe or a 

[beep] that ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the Henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis, bitches been sniffing
(Flacko Jodye Season)
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on 'em?
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams

[Chorus: Acyde]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long

[Break: A$AP Rocky]
Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini
We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show 'em how we do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey

[Verse 3: Yasiin Bey]
Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell 'em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona, steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover, Flacko glowing in that Owens
That's how it's going (Gotta find my way back home)
Huh, awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places
Space and time, in a country called Earth

[Outro: A$AP Yams]
Nah'mean? These tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures
Wearing all types of motherfuckin' red and green stripes
Over accessorizing out this motherfucker
We from Harlem, we gave y'all motherfuckers this wave
Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogie boards right now out this motherfucker
Y'all just gon' keep watching us at the beach shore
With your motherfuckin' khakis rolled up
With your chancletas in your hand
And we just gon' keep surfing on this motherfucker
Straight up! It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini
Yo Rock man, let these motherfuckers know what it is
Out this motherfucker, A$AP, bitch!

[Intro]
Don't give a fuck about your man
I'm just seeing what it's hitting for (bitch I'm sayin')
How you fronting on the kid though?
You should fuck with me girl, you know what you need, girl
See I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah
In search of love and for a wife to call my own, yeah
It's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah
Swear that I can't get no rest in California

[Verse 1]
Swear that life is, just a whole bunch of vices
Niggas biting off of my shit, my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless
Wonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin
With a light mix or a light switch, white chick
Darkskin complexion and she righteous
I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch, light this

[Chorus]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Bless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)
'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Yeah, I'm just, she making mistakes
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

[Post-Chorus]
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs

[Verse 2]
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures
Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts

[Chorus]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things)
Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

[Post-Chorus]
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs

[Intro: Max B]
… Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he’d make it hot
You don’t wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that’ll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don’t really want beef
I’m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard-headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat? (nigga)
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak (nigga)
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga naps
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what the blood clot
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Bridge: Max B]
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
And I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
And I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Outro: Joe Fox]
Sorry guys

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
- Yo, what's your name, young blood? What they call you?
- Well I got, I got, James, Jimmy or Byron Dean
- Yeah, I've been feeling that really JD swag lately man

[Verse: A$AP Rocky & (A$AP Ferg)]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Alright!)
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas
I'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender, better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead (Yeah!)
You want oil nigga money, royalness, and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead (Grrr! Yeah!)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Now I'm only up again
Kick... kick a man while he's down
Looks dead; can’t be safe to say it
Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you, how have you been?
Probably an undercover, had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & (A$AP Ferg)]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece (Booyah!)
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Bop, bop, bop, alright)
Rep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef (That's right, booyah!)
Blow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets
Jimmy Dean
(Alright!)

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
And this love, and this love, and this love gon' own our

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I think my cup is getting muddy, oh buddy
Is this that punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?
Eyes bloody when we out in public
I'm hubby, she say she love me
Wasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy
Then I became a druggy, enhanced my fame and money
And for your pain and suffering, my karma's waiting for me
Expecting payments from me
But she won't get a damn thing from me
She just might get a band-aid from me
You swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sip and whine
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)
I know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)

[Chorus: Joe Fox]
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
How the fuck am I supposed to live?
How many fucks am I supposed to give?
How the fuck am I supposed to feel?
Treated like a bill, cut the check and split
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick

[Verse 2: Future]
You the one that was putting up with me
You see how these streets corrupted me
I gotta conquer everything in front of me
Even though I broke your heart, how can you turn on me?
We with the shits on the real
I do this shit on the real, I like them drinks on the real
I fuck your bitch on the real
We do this shit on the real, keep it real on the real
I was just keeping it G, she don't spend money at first
Say you're in love with me, but I know it never gon' work
I come through, top back, hangin' out the Vert
Eyes screwed up, I'm drinkin' syrup
I know that look that you givin' me
It's killing you softly mentally

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sip and whine
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)
I know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)

[Intro: Juicy J]
The hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
It come true

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I'm a vet still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands
Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell naw, I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

[Outro: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (What I, do)

[Verse 1]
A ghost by any other name
She’s just a frozen satellite
She’ll close her mouth and kiss with her eyes
A rose just goes insane
She spoke soft prose in Catalan
But goes further south when she speaks her mind

[Chorus]
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

[Verse 2]
A ghost that creeps around
A crystal surface underground
A light shows flowers crushed inside
At most the blooms get high
And stay there frozen underground
But she’s a ghost that smell like a rose

[Chorus]
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
If we were just strangers, then we would fall in love again
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty
And now I can see why everyone acts weird to me
Abandon extreme wealth and casual cruelty

[Chorus 1: Joe Fox]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
So, so

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceship
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh

[Chorus 2: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days of razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, a whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give (fuck)
So

[Chorus 1: Joe Fox]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

[Chorus 2: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
So, so

[Chorus 1: Joe Fox]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

RIP to the Speaker Knockers
All they wanna do is count commas
You know that I'm married to the guapa
You couldn't see the money with binoculars

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It feels like my lady is the money
I wish I could have a baby with the money
I can't leave the house without her on me
You know that I'm married to the money (x5)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I had a fake chain, I was 16
I gave they ass some Timbs, but them shits clean
I remember stealing candy from Andrew's
Getting whip-its from my aunty's, some damn food
I remember me and my homies skipped school
Even in her hooptie, I'm still cool
I'm from the 3rd man the crip called comma
Ain't seen my other crib and everyone in 4 months
I spend this money rappin' that boy like so what?
Cash shoes with the cash dudes, go nuts
Ain't nothin' gonna come between you and I
You the only one I need in my life

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It feels like my lady is the money
I wish I could have a baby with the money
I can't leave the house without her on me
You know that I'm married to the money, the money

Girl that handsome boy
Play that pussy, girl play it for a

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse]
You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth

[Chorus]
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me

[Outro]
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me

[Emily Main]
You're the one who gets my heart to race and my arms to sweat
You're the one I'd risk my life and waste it on a bet

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Temptation sweet, I taste it
That casino waitress, drinks sedated
You the one I want, you the one I want, face it
You the one I want on a one-on-one basis
You can see my weakness, a week is not long enough
I need every season and this the only reason
You the one I want, you the one I want
Leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin'
Doin' blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it
Probably twenty more before I'm done
If gambling's a sin, then I'm rollin' dice with Lucifer
To make sure I ain't losin' you
That's what a craps shooter does, I'm bankin' on the win
Bankin' on the last, vacant from the job that I had
Life savings in my pocket
If I never make it back, then I had the option of takin' a risk
So before I slit my wrist, I'm a cash in on this last poker chip
You can bet

[Hook: Emily Main]
Ooh, Vegas, baby, ooh, Vegas, baby
Ooh, Vegas, baby, I was scared of you
Ooh, Vegas, baby, you're Vegas, baby
You're Vegas baby, I was scared of you

[Outro: Emily Main]
You're the one who's got me drinkin' wine until I'm fallin' down
You're the one who keeps the slot machines spinnin' around

[Verse 1: Jidenna]
My name calling all night
I can pull the wool while I'm being polite
Like, darling calling all night
I can be a bull while I'm being polite
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
I know many women want to be in my life
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
Why can't every woman end up being my wife?

[Pre-Hook: Jidenna]
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a Classic Man
You can be mean when you look this clean
I'm a Classic Man
Calling on me like a young OG
I'm a Classic Man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man
Yeah baby I'm a Classic Man

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Okay
Hopping out cold with a bad bitch
Man this is all I adore for ya
To care for me, watching all that for
Can you know attention, what you doing all that for
Get yo ho and listen, I run a coalition
A pretty face, fat booty, camel toe now listen

You even got you a Chevy
And I bought me a Bentley
You finally found you a plug, then I succeed on my 

[?]
You better look check out the scope, look like it 0 to pimpin'
I do this shit for the sport, like its a hobby of sort
I make the birdy spread a eagle, and that's just par for the course
Man I'm a classic man, Maybach Sedan
Suit black and tan with the racks in hand
Say ya had some bad bitches with a hairdo
A sucka hatin', I don't know what they're doing for

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jidenna]
I burn through the hood like whoa
When everybody's feeling so cold
I'm cool like Nat King Cole
And niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mummafucka
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mummafucka
Treat me like a don, mummafucka
And we don't live by the law, mummafucka

[Pre Hook+Hook]

[Verse 1]
Shit was all good now but it ain’t like it used to be
You was by my side but you ain't like you used to be, damn
Oh go head and say that I'm wrong for you
This shit might be wrong but it sound like the truth to me, tell me
I know I'm wrong but ask
I always end up with them glamour girls, that's your type
And then keep runnin' into problems that I did before
You always been that random go and hit the floor type
Even when I would tell you I know
Praise God for sunshine, oh
Sunshine on me, shine for you
When it's rainin' on me oh
How do we love this oh?

[Chorus]
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me oh
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me
'Cause I got it, I think I got it
I think I got it, think I got it, girl

[Verse 2]
Lookin' for the girls with their hair and their nails on fleek
Bad little girl and she came out here for the weekend
She ain't gon' do it for you niggas but she do it for the team
She down for the freakin'
When I'm lookin' for the girls on road
You the one that's the word on road
I won't lie I see me with it
Ridin' down in the S 63 with it
Fuck around made way more money than I made last week
Made more honeys than a nigga banged last weekend
But I'm givin' no fucks in the top down freakin'
Couple hoes in the telly and that's why I'm not speakin'
'Cause I know

[Chorus]
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me oh
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me
'Cause I got it, I think I got it
I think I got it, think I got it, girl
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah

[Chorus]
Everybody is kung fu fighting (hoo! huh!)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing (life that you're writing)

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art (ha!)
If you just go all the way (look out)
Now what would it take to break (chee!)
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight (hoo!)
But you have got to win

[Chorus]
Everybody is kung fu fighting (hoo! huh!)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

Why is it so hard to see (yeah)
Maybe it's just because (ooo)
You keep on looking at me (huh!)
The journey's a lonely one (ooo)
So much more than we know (yeah)
But sometimes you've got to go (ooo)
Go on and be your own hero

[Chorus]
Everybody is kung fu fighting (kung fu fighting)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning (hoo! hah!)
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing (life that you're writing)

You're a diamond in the rough (ooo)
A brilliant ball of clay (yeah)
You could be a work of art (oh!)
If you just go all the way (yeah)
Now what would it take to break (ooo)
I believe that you can bend (yeah)
Not only do you have to fight (ooo)
But you have got to win

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting (kung fu fighting)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning (yeah, yeah)
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing

You can get a chicken wrapped like McDonalds

The birds they fly from Japan, man I can’t wait when they land
I’m unwrapping the saran
The Js go crazy, I’m weighing the baby like 1980s
I pull up, gold rings on, in a drop Mercedes
Your bitch bad, she in the kitchen, her wrist go crazy
Don’t try to tell me I’m a gram short, nigga I just weighed it
My niggas is animals, eat you up like cannibals

I skkrt in a Phantom, excuse my manners

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it with you
Pour my feelings out and spill it with you
That's a no-no, but what he don't know
Never hurt him, so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
No, I'm kiddin', I'm knowin' my dick is different
He kept his distance, I kept comin' over and stayed persistent
You bitin' your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that I'm honest
But, fuck it, I'm going all out
You should too, good things don't last forever, I thought you knew

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my own horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on a chair

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?
Take that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

A nigga cut off his right hand, send the bottle to the white man
Before I could sing my ABC's, I had a AK
Before I could count through one, two, three, I had a trey eight
Can't cook roast, but I cook dope
A hundred P's of the good smoke
If you play here, don't pay me, drop neck on your head 'till your neck broke
Cadillac with them straps in it, show jeans with them racks in it
This business with that business, but I settle for the crack business

[Hook: (x2)]

[Verse 1]
Actor, but never for stage or screen
In a cauldron of crime
Did she want him or want to be him?
And did she smoke a cigarette in the dark?

[Chorus]
Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen

[Verse 2]
Every cell of hers more alive
And bright than mine
Did she want me or want to be me?
And did she smoke a cigarette in the dark?

And I give back to my hood and my homies passin' out hunnids

[Chorus: Duke]

Most of all the niggas I run with be wanted
Pull up, spray, I'm on north side, that's my condolence

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bring it to the Thugger, meet me on Gresham, new gold medal

And my weed kinda loud like a motherfuckin' pill
Ooh, I wanna spend my night with you

I want to ride my bike with you (Skrrrt)
I want a wife and girl it's you
I'll stand up for you like Moses
I do my best and yeah, she notice it
Said only got one face, ain't no emoji
I swear to god this ain't no bogus shit
Even though I'm hot, I got the coldest wrist
I made a million and she know about it
I showed my brother, little bitch, and he didn't know about it

[Pre-Chorus: Duke]
Let me stand up in that pussy like I'm on a ladder
Beat that thang up sideways, up, down and backwards
I just get that head and get ghost, they should call me Casper

Um, I'm tired right now too
Haha
Let's get to this next one
Verse 1 (Trey Songz):
First things first let me hop out this motherfucking reef
I ain't never gave a damn what a motherfucker say
Like Ye say ball all motherfucking day
It's some pussy, pussy niggas in the motherfucking way
She snappin while she twerkin in the goddamn mirror
She clap it, then I ask to see that ass more clearer
Do she get that work in the mirror?
Shake that shit like she Shakira
She do some tricks with the stick
She make that dick disappear
My niggas came home, got a couple niggas still in there
Caught em ridin dirty like a motherfucking Millionare
I just filled the safe up with some change like a mil in there
I just love yo face, I love your fram but ain't no feeling there

Chorus:
I pull up in something, ridiculous don't let your bitches see
I pull up with one, ridiculous might be your bitch with me
Niggas be hatin, oh boy they so sick of me
These niggas be fakin, I'm what they pretend to be

Verse 2 (Trey Songz):
Come my way like motherfucking Fetty
Come through in it, have ya motherfucking sweating
Bumping on some old dog motherfucking cali
Just turnt 21, seems like these hoes ready
You gotta check, my nigga you gotta check
I spend yo check on my neck, I give the strippers the rest
She say she gotta invest, she want that booty and breast
She never gotta get wet, she say she do me the best
They say I gotta get back, I be like where did I go
They say that niggas is whack, I be like oh yeah I know
They be like let's take a trip, baby that pussy the passport
Don't I be stampin that bitch, maybe that's what they made for


Verse 3(JR):
We strapped in this bitch like the taz force
Pow! We stack I got cash for it
I'm palmin this 30
The judge and the jury, ain't nothing that we gotta ask for
But she add me on to like I asked for
Bobble head like she stick to the dashboard
Suck a bowling ball right through the sippy cup
Only 7 a.m.. shots fired already
Ain't been woke 5 mins and I'm high already
Fuck niggas post to kill me, he done lied already
If he was really bout that life, I'd been died already

Outro(Trey&JR):
I got models blowing dope, watch they eyes get low
She say pull over then she ride on the side of the road

[Verse 1]
If she’d fallen in love, first blood, you didn’t notice
It’s not love, it’s a close call
You poor thing, you’ve got to stop calling it love
You’ve got to be ignorin' the first girl
She’s so clever, she said

[Chorus]
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

[Verse 2]
She wants you, and love don’t come into the equation
What she loves is sex in parked cars and the Photo Booth at Cha Cha
She’s not a hologram, got damn, you can’t ignore it
She’s such fun, she says “Don’t run," she said

[Chorus]
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

[Verse 3]
You’re cornered, and she just needs revolution
That’s cute, but she’s no pearl of Gisborne

[Chorus]
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

[Chorus]
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?

[Verse 1]
She made me buy her a chameleon
With each eye on a different sun
She made me watch Evangelion
In another life, did she blow my brains out?

[Chorus]
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?

[Verse 2]
She found me in Robot Restaurant
Now I’ll give her whatever she want
Would she listen to a recording of my silly voice
On the last day of her life?

[Chorus]
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?

[Verse 1]
Transform into the animal you need to
Fly from a destiny infested with chemicals
You need a new drug not invented by the C.I.A
I wanna be your friend but don’t have the self-control
We’re in love, but I don’t get what you see in me

[Chorus]
Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw
Just hangin' in here, trying to be your
Necessary evil, necessary evil

[Verse 2]
Nobody can get a tan in the moonlight
Come on inside, tell me: is it just a bit too much?
He drooled on a pillow and looked like an angel
She hit a blunt, but it would not chill her out at all
We’re in love, but she don’t get what I see in her

[Chorus]
Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw
Just hangin' in here, trying to be your
Necessary evil, necessary evil
Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw
Just hangin' in here, trying to be your
Necessary evil, necessary evil

[Verse 3]
Transform into the animal you need to
Fly from a destiny infested with chemicals
You need a new drug not invented by the C.I.A
I wanna be your friend but don’t have the self-control
We’re in love, but I don’t get what you see in me

[Chorus]
Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw
Just hangin' in here, trying to be your
Necessary evil, necessary evil
Lovin' me could be your fatal flaw
Just hangin' in here, trying to be your
Necessary evil, necessary evil
Necessary evil, necessary evil
Necessary evil, necessary evil
Necessary evil, necessary evil...

[Verse]
America, open up your door
Is it right to always fight against “the other?"
And what is a “person of color?"
Is it wrong to have zone that isn’t monochrome?
Einstein’s brain is kept at Princeton University
Please don’t ask it questions

[Chorus]
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore

[Verse]
America, open up your door
Is it right to always fight against “the other?"

[Chorus]
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore

[Intro: Blaqstarr]
When you walk through the garden
You gotta watch your back
Well I beg your pardon
Off the straight and narrow track
If you walk with Jesus
He's gonna save your soul
But you gotta keep the devil
Way down in the hole

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
Sitting at home all alone
Got my laptop, trying to save my song
Good and evil seems to blow hot and cold
'Cause I’m tested by the best of both worlds
But I got a lot of questions for my soul
But Jesus don’t have phone for me to call
So I’ll make it to the garden on my own
Trying to bury that devil down a hole

[Hook: Blaqstarr]
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
If learn from the past will I go
To a future that no one seems to know
If Jesus only saves the young and old
Then the middle's where I walk with y'all
If the devil equals money equals war
Then the biggest boil is within us all
I got a shovel in the garden with the wall
And tonight I'll stick the devil down a hole

[Hook: Blaqstarr]
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down

[Bridge: Blaqstarr]
He's got the fire and the fury
At his command
Well you don't have to worry
If you hold on to Jesus hand
We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls
We just gotta keep the devil
Way down in the hole

[Outro: Blaqstarr]
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down in the hole
Way down

[Verse 1]

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh
Yesterday I woke up to the news
I was very very sad to hear
My favourite show would disappear, and
Today I'm filling up with blues
Though I'm happy that her tummy's growing
A DJ that we love is going

How'm I gonna make it from 10 through to 1?
And how'm I gonna tell her we'll miss her a tonne?
How to tell her thanks for the records she played?
Thanks for introducing us to Lana del Rey
Thanks for the stories and all the good times
Festival tales, Kilimanjaro climbs
Thanks for all the mornings, in the Lounge we'd arrive
And sweetly you'd tell us, "No swearing, we're live!"

Oh Fearne you made all of my mornings fly
Like the sun bursting through a cloud, into a cloudy sky
And you'll be great at anything that you wanna try
Now it's hard, but it's time for us to say goodbye
Bye Fearne

[Intro]
Get it

[Chorus]
I think she ready for a kiddy
She told me she gon' make me miss her
She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling
My dick like crack so yeah, I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard 'til her partition

[Verse 1]
Where the fuck you going, girl? I miss you
I wanna bang like a pistol
I wanna bang like a Crip do
I'm banging red like suu whoo, ooh
Brand new Rollie I'm living sporty
Flood you with gold like a trophy
She still the bomb, call her lotus
Hey, racks keep me up without Folger's
I'm up, I'm up
I might hit 'em with them bucks just in case he got luck
This a Crime Mob lifestyle nigga, knuck if you buck
Just 'cause I'm in New York with a puck
Don't mean you won't get stuck up, up
Ayy, I might just tell this ho my secrets
First I like them red like a demon
A purse, every time lil' momma catch me cheating
Starburst, I won't eat it unless she creamy

[Chorus]
I think she ready for a kiddy
She told me she gon' make me miss her
She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling
My dick like crack so yeah, I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard 'til her partition

[Verse 2]
I done completed my little mission
I put something in your stomach next to your kidney
I want nothing to do with none of these lil' bitches
I want something to do with everything and I'm willing
To go to church and ask God there for forgiveness
For everything and tell that preacher that I'm gon' remember
Him bringing you in my life and that's on my children
Fuck all them other hoes talking, they Wendy Williams
Now your wrist got ice like December
I pour out the paint like Mutumbo
I'm a fucking lion like Simba
And, yeah, my girl ballin' like Kendra

[Chorus]
I think she ready for a kiddy
She told me she gon' make me miss her
She let me wear her whole lil' ceiling
My dick like crack so yeah, I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard 'til her partition

I just might put my glasses on when I pursue ya
She got me going to church, now I say hallelujah
Bring that ass to the Thugger, bring that ass, baby
And you know I see straight through that ass like glass baby
I turn into a monster without a mask baby (Gar!)
You know I'll be your sponsor, I'll help you pass baby
Rollie, Rollie, girl, suck up my woadie
I am loaded, there's no need to show it
My trap spot rollin' like roly polys (Rollie Rollie)
And I'll buy her a Focus 'cause she's focused (Thugger!)

[Chorus]
My lil' mama say she know I stay G fresh (I'm G Fresh)
When I get home, she lay on my chest like a vest (Lay on my chest)

P.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!!!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'ma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, that's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl, I'ma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, Tunechi

[Intro]
Dope money
Yeah nigga I got that dope money
Yeah nigga I got that dope money
Fuck nigga I got ya ho money

[Verse 1]
I spend a hunnid thou on a diamond ring
Make a hunnid thou every time it ring
Super bad bitch every time it ring
And I got her boxed in like she in the ring
Walking in the rain drinking champagne
Can't you feel my pain, going through a thing
In a room full of lines I'm the line king
And imma leave a couple mill for my offspring
Been ballin everyday since last spring
Ten diamond chains on nigga bling-bling
A female dark skin plug Darlene
Got the six deal white like chlorine

[Hook]
You got that junk in ya trunk got a speed bump rump
You know my pockets got them mumps
Baby I get ya drunk
I get ya drunk, drunk drunk
I get ya drunk, drunk drunk
So many bottles in my section that its bad for ya health
I had ya homegirl so wasted she took a piss on herself
I had her drunk, drunk drunk
I had her drunk, drunk drunk

[Verse 2]
Bitch sitting on a brick of cocaine
I'm the muthafuckin man and the dope mane
Come take a pic with me why not baby
Can you come be my mistress bitch
I'll box you in like my phone ringing its a million babies
Brazilian waxes on my hoes and they ain't South American
Have you ever been to Medellin, I've been there but can't go again
Breakfast with Colombians date with the Mexicans
I had a meeting but I didn't need it, I just got them chickens up

[Hook]
You got that junk in ya trunk got a speed bump rump
You know my pockets got them mumps
Baby I get ya drunk
I get ya drunk, drunk drunk
I get ya drunk, drunk drunk
So many bottles in my section that its bad for ya health
I had ya homegirl so wasted she took a piss on herself
I had her drunk, drunk drunk
I had her drunk, drunk drunk

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
These days of preference has no complexion
You could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin
Just light the candle
Cold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble
And she know
Love with me is like a casino, outside of Reno
A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio
House keys to P.O
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Hangovers, leftovers in the Range Rover
Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover
When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride
Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
On the highway to my place
It's higher than you ever been
By to my way, be all day
Me, you and all your friends
In love, fuckin'
In love, just too much, ohh

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
These days of preference has no complexion

[Verse 1]
I'll make it look so easy
Girl, it's so easy, so easy, so easy
Do what I do, it's easy
Girl, it's so easy, so easy, so easy

[Bridge]
I'm not trying to talk at all
'Cause I’m tryna' love you crazy
I'm tryna' love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
Drink 'til you numb the pain

[Hook]
I got them touching on they body
These girls keep touching on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
I got 'em thinking that they want me
Although they know they're not the only
I got them wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the 90's are dangerous

[Verse 2]
I'll give it up so easy
Girl, I'm too easy, too easy, too easy
I'ma fall in love until they leave me
'Cause they gon' leave me, gon' leave me, gon' leave me

[Bridge]
I'm not trying to talk at all
'Cause I’m tryna' love you crazy
I'm tryna' love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup

These girls born in the 90's are dangerous
Many years ago I was a simple man
A simple man, no worries me
I never lied
Please read me

Not much conversation ever came from me
I never saw reality
I never tried
Please read me

Ah....

Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long
I'll stay if you can see me through, explain why

Please read me (x3)
He smiled and rubbed the stubble on his chin
He sure shall find the weariness and dreariness of life that's growing thin
Yet, he didn't have so very far to go
With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned
With a mere step in the mountain to a light

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

Even in the morning when he slept
Something odd is missing
There's nothing very much to talk about
And nothing very much to see

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

Talks about the place he'd like to go
And you never see the worrying and hurrying that makes a person slow
Yet, you wouldn't think he'd be so hard to find
Yet, he looks so very busy but there's nothing on his mind
And his wavy hair continues not to grow
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice
I received an invitation
'Come to the United Nations'
That was when I was somebody
In my own time

Sitting selling hot cross buns
Thousand suckers everyone
Sounds just like a nursery rhyme
In my own time

Even when the lights go out
Still got things to think about
Memories I can't call mine
In my own time

My own time
My own time
Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century

And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century

Big wide hats and men is spats
At the turn of the century
With those horseless carriages
At the turn of the century

And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century

Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century, turn of the century

[Intro] (Robin Gibb)
Ooh you're a holiday, such a holiday
Ooh you're a holiday, such a holiday

[Verse 1] (Robin Gibb)
It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

[Verse 2] (Robin Gibb)
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head

[Chorus] (Robin Gibb)
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

[Bridge] (Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb)
De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de

Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

[Verse 3] (Robin Gibb)
Ooh you're a holiday
Every day, such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say
And I say you're a holiday

[Verse 1] (Robin Gibb)
It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"

I fail to understand
Why you don't want my hand
I try to find what's on your mind
I wonder

Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?

One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"

Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me:
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?
One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you, I love you. I love you"
Red chair, fade away
Bring back memories
Think of something nice
Fragrant lemon trees

I can feel the speaking sky
I don't want to know
It's filling up the air

Grandpa's fairy tale
Red chair round the fire
Rainbows all the time

We're all going higher
I can feel the speaking sky
I don't want to know
It's filling up the air

Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Bring back memories
Think of something nice
Fragrant lemon trees

I can feel the speaking sky
I don't want to know
It's filling up the air
Red chair fade away

If you dream to the top
You'll be over the edge
If you get it on side
You'll be taking a ditch
You'll be loving our love
But you don't know why
It's the term of the day
So we never excite
If your heart isn't there
So you might as well say
"I know it, I got it but I know that time will set me together"

[Verse 1: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
Weight of love on my shoulders
I thought that it would be easier than this
I found my heart had grown colder
But the warmth of your kiss, I can't dismiss

[Pre-Chorus: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you

[Chorus: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

[Refrain: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it

It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on

[Verse 2: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
I've seen times that were harder
I remember the taste of bitterness
Won't you help me, my father?
Help me fall in the love that I have missed

[Pre-Chorus: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you

[Chorus: Disclosure & Gregory Porter]
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it

Answering Machine Beep
This is a motherfucking test
Ladies, play this song before you have sex
And if your man finishes before this song does, trade his ass in

[Verse 1: Unknown]
I wanna feel you inside
Come on and take a ride
This ass is all for you
(Come and fuck me like a ho, ho-oh)

[Hook: Various, unknown]
Sexual harassment (Sexual harassment)
Sexual harassment (Sexual harassment)

I wanna feel you on top
(Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up)
What can a limp dick do
(Nights have (empty?) have control, ho-oh)
Baby

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre (Unknown)]
Hold your head back (Uh, oh)
Lay it to the side (Huh, oh)
Hey bitch, (Dre) open those thighs (Oh baby)
Hold your head back, back, back (Oh), now close your eyes (Oh)
Hey bitch (Damn), open those thighs (Uh, uh, oh)

[Verse 4: Unknown]
So when I feel you, inside me

It's sexual harassment (Sexual harassment)
Oh baby, (Sexual harassment, sexual harassment) give it to me (Sexual), get on (Sexual harassment), get it on

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Heavy Breathing
Goddamn this song longer than a motherfucka
I'm dying in this motherfucka

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Not many days left (Bring that shit)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Too much stress can make a nigga hesitate with no time left
(I feel blessed though)
Here we go to the next
A Dr. Dre exclusive with music bruising your neck (What the fuck?)
Rip your plans up, Dre's ruling
You don't want to fuck around with the hands, let alone the gun foolin'
Like De La had niggas plug tunin'
Me and L had niggas zooming, me and Snoop flew the coup
Me keep your asses moving, with that hot shit
Club niggas like to request this around-the-clock shit
But I do it for my (hood niggas)
With rockets
Who learned how to survive and fatten them pockets
With 'x' amount of dollars the ballers, crime pays
But that snake shit'll leave that ass in a pine grave
Rocking project halls, from your sound-proof stalls
Got all you motherfuckers screaming "Yes yes y'all"

[Verse 2: Hittman]
All we need is 40 ounces and a tool to rule
In city duels used to buck fifty fools
Now I let off like white kids in elementary schools
Hit the news like Stacey Koon to Rodney crazy as a looney tune
Kids watch me, bitches jock me for this shit
Cause Hittman's the breaker of the monotony
For a faker man I won't shake your hand
Instead I'll shake like  land on which you stand like maracas in a mariachi band
Got my love back for this shit
Like  Joanie for Chachi now I'm a cocky man again
So I ride like the wind
In a fly Sedan Benz
Hanging out the window when I turn left to watch my rims spin
Ha, that line got my friends grinnin'
The fine bitches got my ends spendin'
The gin got my mind bendin'
In LA I stay balling like Lorenzen Wright
Lost angels sin at night
And I floss on the timid type
Dominique Dawes on that ass
End your night

Baby girl girl give it up
Niggas can't handle us

We live like Toy's-R-Us
I'ma pull up and I'm not from New York
But I'm living notorious
Hey, hope I don't get you beat up by barbarians
You better walk little boy there ain't no scaring us

We stuntin' ain't no playin' us
Drop top, make it rain on us (Don't try it, don't try it)

(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!)

I'ma fly down on that bitch like a bald eagle
Baby don't say shit to me in public because you are a cheater
Even when I'm in the library studying, I'm smoking loud reefer
It ain't nothing but I caught 3 fever (Gas, gas, gas)
That's that gas mufucka, that's that gas mufucka (Swish, skrrrt)
Pull off in drive a brand new loft on 'em
Whole 7 and a blunt make em cough on 'em
Real ice just like a life, make her mouth on it
When I say keep that then that's sauce homie
I'ma win I hope you can take a loss homie
I'ma pull up like a martian on 4 homie
Take em way out the street, take 'em way out the street, ayy
We ride 5 in a car you know you can't be beat, ayy
Ain't no mouse, but I'm chasing cheese, ayy
I'ma walk into McDonalds get a cup of ice and something to eat
Right before I

I just wanna do it, let that bullshit out her ear
You know I'm banging red like the nose on a 'deer
Why wouldn't I claim her when I put 20 bands in her ear? Icy!
Aye, they work at Follies, boy, you know they righteous
Bitches super wet just like a Porta-Potty

Good morning, it is 45 degrees at six o'clock, in the headlines a 

[?] arrests and more storm fronts
First, let's check out the traffic reports
Houston's only home
God bless Texas 

[?]
Fly pretty high

[Verse]
Oh, Texas, can you hear me?
Speed up on the dawn
To the pinks and blues of Houston
In the sun
Where home is a rust
In the parish of space dust
(Where the mountains die)
And today is golden

[Outro]
Arrested and charged with second-degree robbery
And by the way, he was also violating probation
Now, what's the difference between first degree and second-degree robbery?
Uh, a degree,

Have a great time over there, thanks for listening

This is Lauryn Hill wit' J. Period, this is The Best of Lauryn Hill

[Verse 1]
If they only owned love, shown love, grown love like this before
If they only knew love, true love too long like this before
If they only gave love, saved love, grave love like this before
If they only called love "love", love called "love" like this before
If they'd only shown love, they own love, own love like this before
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-love-love-la-la-la-la-love
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-love like this before, yeah

[Outro]
This is Lauren Hill wit' J. Period, this is The Best of Lauryn Hill

[Intro: Pras]
Yo, this is the Refugees, gonna give you a little vibe of the score
As we bug out in this studio wit' my man, John Peel
You know how we do, bust it

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
How many mikes do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say, "Many, many", say, me say, "Many, many, many"
How many mikes do we rip on the daily?
Many, many, say, me say, "Many, many, many"

[Verse 1: Lauren Hill]
You crossed the line, now there's no comin' back
Emcees are gettin' sucked into my intergalactical pull
I'm the articles on you, on your ass
If you get the microphone, brother, you can just say:
'Pras asked me no questions and I'm tellin' you no lies'
If you're lookin' at me wrong, this wasn't meant for your eyes
Realize you can't knock this cause this style is 'noxious
It's gaseous, I'm turnin' all your rap pages to ashes
Oh, this thing's creative, debated it from here to Asia
Minor rhymers, find your vocabulary
Kind of ordinary, I get tossed up, it's scary
Maybe we're legendary, we roll blunts like Bob Marley
And you sittin' on for Sugarhill, they was a band
My man, learn your history before you try to sham
Oh, shimmy, don't go bar-frontin', jokers need to start
Led to the T-O-Ps where you find the Refugees
Three like Jamaicans say when they feelin' I-R-E
Ha-ha, so Wyclef, won't you touch it?

[Hook]

[Intro]
Allow me to reintroduce myself
L. Boogie, who you gon' scrimmage like you the champion?
L. Boogie spits with perfect syntax, don't check it
Many styles, style so prestigious, make a sinner act religious
Been lifted, lyrically, I'm gifted
L been this way since creation, put the DJ in it
I'm J.Period, I represent the real hip-hop, I'm J.Period
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Boogie on, yo, (-) Lauryn, yo, (-) Lauryn, yo, Lauryn, (-)

[Outro: Rohan Marley]
Rohan Marley talkin' to you
Don't play that track again, you know? Let it go

[Intro: Rohan Marley]
Yeah, yeah, yo, Lauryn, allow me to talk 'bout them, you see it?
J. Period, as usual, run that again, that one's hot, from the top

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some want play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember, not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My t'ing done made your kingdom want run
Now understand L. Boogie non-violent
But if a thing test me, I run for my gun
Can't take a threat to my newborn son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage like you the champion?
You might win some, but you just lost one

[Hook: Lauryn Hill] (x4)
You might win some, but you just lost one

[Verse 2 Lauryn Hill]
Now, now, how come your talk turned cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man want to act like he's exempt
He need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick-talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play me straight, now your whole style bent
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change, then the rain soon come
See, you might win some, but you just lost one

[Hook] (x4)

[Intro]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, what did you really gain from?
What you done done, it's so silly, how come? You just lost one

[Verse 1]
Now, don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Satan wasn't made that strong
Tryin' to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now, some might mistake this just for simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now, even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely, you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some, but you just lost one

[Hook] (x4)
You might win some, but you just lost one

[Bridge]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, what did you really gain from?
What you done done, it's so silly, how come? You might win one

[Outro]
Yo, this is the full genius
Refugees, they're about to take you on a journey
Into the dimensions of the Book of Basement
The basements were, uh...
Hey, yo, one, two, three, the crew is called Refugees
And if they come for testin' rap stylin'
Stop the violence and just bring it on
Y-O, hey, yo, one, two, three, the crew is called Refugees
And if they come for testin' rap stylin'
Stop the violence and just bring it on, Y-O

[Intro]
Yo, what up? This is Nas with the official (-), J. Period
"If I Ruled the World" was originally a Kurtis Blow record
You know? Somebody who I love and saw him in crèche school
And his song wit' "These are the breaks"...
I used to breakdance to his music, you hear what I'm sayin'?
So "If I Ruled the World" was a tribute to him
And also speakin' out to the world
And, um, I used to work wit' the Fugees on tour
And, you know, they would open up for me wit' our first albums
And our second albums, it flipped
And he sold, like, you know, thirty million albums
And I'm — now I'm openin' up for them
So, um, we was — we was cool like that
And, you know, Lauryn came and got on the record
Who I felt was — would make the record even more incredible
Me and her, I really appreciate her work
And, um, and talked to her well
You know, not just my projects, but every projects in December
Everywhere in the world
So I thought that would be the perfect record

[Outro]
If I ruled the world
Still living for today in these last days and times

[Pre-Chorus]
I call lil' mama Makaveli she gon' ride with me
Mama booty thick as some bread I need some thighs with it
I'ma hold on to all that ass and I'ma die with it
I'ma snake inside this grass and I'ma survive with it
I ain't never had a problem I'm tryna tie with it
I couldn't afford a pair but I can bike ride with it
I'm like 'Ed, Edd n Eddy' baby I try with it
Now all them diamonds going splash, pussy dive in it

[Chorus]
And I want her ass 'cause she hot no Clay
She got a nigga sitting inside all day and
She make a nigga find her somewhere to stay
When she get mad she moving in one day
I swear the baddest bitches got the biggest foreheads
Even when she mad she never take me to court day
I'm uptown baby, I'm uptown I'm passing New Orleans

[Interlude]
My P.O. tripping and shit man
So I can't smoke so I'm just drinkin' the fuck out this drink you know
Popping them motherfucking Percs nigga
No Xans, no downers, nigga we up
Fuck you mean

[Verse 1]
Baby girl know that I'm a king
Hustle hard, million views without a machine
I just might marry that little bitch and call her my thing
Marry her two times the way she suck on my d-ding
Put her out the house and make her leave all of the things
I bought her, I caught her cheating with a nigga such a stalker
But I don't give no damn 'cause she mine yes I bought her
I pull up in the Lamb after school pick up her daughter
Every time she get mad she acting like she don't remember
She don't remember nothing good but she remember tenders
She remember they hopped on that wood and caught a splinter
She remember that time when they cooked me that TV dinner
She remember that time every time I snuck in the house all late
And I remember the time when she was serious she'd never play
Damn how you know bro
Got a new ho sat butt ass naked right in front of nigga stove
Nigga money stacked up like Ludacris afro
Got a hundred hoes I lie to like I'm Pinocchio
When they say they 'bout to leave I'm like baby don't leave
I'ma run it up even if it come down to selling weed
I'ma stack them big bucks, yes I want that Chuck E. Cheese
I want them Ms no Mickey D's
Then I bounce back on them
I'ma catch a bitch and make her bite like a piranha
She gon' suck that dick and spray all over her all summer
I used to be broke and now they coming by the bundle
Take her on the date and then I cut her like a barber
Pull up on the fair with a bale of them birds
Piss on your bitch mouth like it's a curb
Cartier swag on my face, no nerd
I don't like talk bro tell 'em no words

[Bridge]
Officer...
Save me
I'm gone, so gone off a Perc
I done went from rapping to reggae

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hottest baby blaze me
Akeem mink no '80s
Grown money so you can't age me
Gators on my feet got scabies
Hundred thousand hoes on my Avi
I'll send that pussy boy to Grady
I'll leave them pussy niggas skimpy
God, why'd they get me started?
Quan said he riding with four choppers no Harley
I'm known for drawing on the plugs yes arson
I'ma put them bitches in they place so then they barking
Mama had me inside of a store 'cause I'm the Target
Baby you still sucking cheap meat, it's like a market
I got a spot in Dunwoody with a WD Arthur
Bird told me these pussy niggas gon' try to murk me, but umm

[Refrain]
I call lil' mama Makaveli, she gon' ride with me
I call lil' mama Makaveli-veli-veli-veli
I call lil' mama Makaveli, she gon', she gon'
I call lil' mama Maka-Maka-Makaveli-veli

[Chorus]
And I want her ass 'cause she hot no Clay
She got a nigga sitting inside all day and
She make a nigga find out somewhere to stay
When she get mad she moving in one day
I swear the baddest bitches got the biggest foreheads
Even when she mad she never take me to court day
I'm uptown baby, I'm uptown I'm passing New Orleans

[Verse 3]
Chopper City!
Fuck a Gates we chop that bitch, lil' boy you tripping
I'm the realest nigga Notorious BIG
First I kill you boy and then I make your bitch suck dick
Suck that dick lil' bitch, cuff that, spit lil' bitch
Swallow that nut lil' bitch, shit it out when you shit
I'm a creature, I'm amazing
Sit on that wood like you just walked inside a gymnasium
And your bookin' while I'm acein'
Playing games on my turf you got to be a gangsta
I hope you ain't doing nothin' boy you a wanksta
You should know you want beef with Thugger gon' cater
You should know that these Bloods gon' be the waiters (Soo-woo)
Hundred S double M's
Hundred motherfucking whoadies
Hundred motherfucking ganstas
Hundred motherfucking troops
Hundred thousand of my people
Hundred thousand Pirus
Hundred thousand geeked monsters
Hundred thousand no bullshit
Better know what you're doing before you do it
'Cause when I pull up I'ma let it loose I'm not pursuing
I'm a motherfucking gangsta nigga know I have 'em right
As Kurt no Angle I'ma slap him with the banger
First I got the money then the power, no ranger
Just because you don't see me don't mean that I'm a stranger
Twenty thousand dollars on a smile no anger
I'm a beast bitch you can not tame me
Just falling out
Not making much of anything at all
But all you could hide
From what's there in the past of it

Just falling out
Not making much of anything at all
But all you could hide
From what's there in the past of it

Just falling out
All you can't hide
All you can't hide

Just falling out
All you can't hide
Hongkongaton

All you can't hide
Just falling out
(Not making much of anything at all but)
All you can't hide
(From what's there in the past of it)
Just falling out
(Not making much of anything at all but)
All you can't hide

Just falling out

All you can't hide

Not making much of anything at all but
All you can't hide

All you can't hide

[Chorus]
Too many days to get lost
Many, many people I've known got lost
Too many days to get lost
Many, many people I've known got lost

[Chorus]

[Intro: Damon Albarn]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Hook: Damom Albarn]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

[Verse 1: De La Soul]
Drums'll fall heavy like anvil weight
Higher than your sky scape goat cheese
Order, order, please
Run, Joe, run, there are criminals behind you
Side-winders and snakes your moves define you
Remind you:
How I wish my brother Del was here
Catalogue originals, the expert's clear
Sheared legs of lamb your whole style's ham
We are tons and tons and you are just a gram
In the hand of irrelevance, banned from the benefits
Cancellin' your visa
Pushing 'til you lean like the Pisa
These-za, 30 below freeze-za
Caesar got stabbed cause he was a biatch
Gia
Piano key-za , select to touch the ivory
I see it in black and white
It's an easy ideology
We sigh, and sweat, and tear, save the blood for valentine
Tell me how you're feelin' at the end of the rhyme

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bootie Brown]
They say I have no meaning, no purpose
So why do I exist?
I purchase me some bracelets to protect my wrists
I hid that rope, I flushed those pills
All those opposing me cause they can't get the deals
I catch them in a pickle trying to steal home plate
When I got the home field advantage
Don't think they can manage
Stop this shine, cross this line
You will find it didn't have to go there
Leading out to nowhere
Faster than a bullet train
I got me a Lois Lane, I'm feeling like I'm Superman
Here in the Yucatan
I yell it from the studio, loud and clear
Howl in here
Explosion, damage, corrosion
It's what remains in your theory
I'm in this emissary
'Til the end of the love letter
We'll go get her
"Can't" has no place in my vocabulary
Why you even doubt it?
It wasn't necessary

[Hook]

[Outro: Damon Albarn]
The Future, It's Coming On
It's Coming On, It's Coming On
It's Coming On, It's Coming On
It's Coming On, It's Coming On
The Future, It's Coming On
It's Coming On, It's Coming On
It's Coming On, It's Coming On
It's Coming On, It's Coming On...

[Chorus]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Chorus]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Bridge]
Oh, why'd you go right?
Some might go alone
What you want in life?
Someone here'll gonna get past by

[Chorus]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Chorus]
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

[Verse 1]
I’m a writer and a lover
I’m a Midwest music man
And I’ve been to a lot of places
But I’m gon’ end where I began
I took class in Carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in Paris

[Chorus]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father’s father too
I used to live in New York City
But baby, that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 2]
I don’t claim to be a prophet
I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is
And sometimes God makes it rhyme
I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in Stockholm

[Chorus]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, my father’s father too
I used to live in New York City
But baby, that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 3]
You know I ain’t gon’ live forever
Baby it won’t be long
At the wake they’ll say “He made a lot of mistakes
But he could write hell of a song”
And I made, I made killing
Though I never really was employed
I had a girl from San Diego

[Chorus / Outro]
But I’ll be buried in
I killed a show in Indonesia
But I’ll be buried in
I made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

Bitch was jumping on 'em, can't get hit you for your cent up
Niggas know where I be at, sway since on kilo
Money out the deck, got them bitches going on bitch mode
Cake, cock back, hit the nigga in his earlobes
S.O.D Gang taking over, nigga, tempo
Riding thru my trap, Zone 1 to be exact tho
West Side, got them goons shoot you in your back, ho
Fucking with my niggas, you know we getting paid
Got my whole bottom teeth, gold grill all day
Put the money in your face, I'm at the VMA's
Getting so much money, Soulja Boy across the states
Pussy ass nigga thought this shit was going down
Till' I pulled up to the trap and heard the Yokohama sound
2012 Bentley, I'm aiming at my enemies
Pussy nigga talking about, don't kill me, confuse me
I don't give a fuck, bitch-nigga I'm never scared
Bitch I'm in the (?), I put the money on your head
S.O.D.M.G man, that's the fucking move
Shouts-out to my niggas, yeah, I'm repping the whole crew
Post up, bitch like a motherfucking cane
Twelve chains on my neck, Soulja Boy (?)
Pussy ass niggas, know that I'm the problem
Came out the water like a mothefucking dolphin
Gold grill, shawty, mane get these haters off me
A million dollars in cash in one day, bitch I'm awesome
Soulja Boy Tell'em, your girl gave me an awesome jaw-some
Pull up to the trap, wheels look like Wheel Of Fortune
Bitch, I'm not a (?) but I know the future

Lil' Dre my name, I gives a fuck what you heard
Pull up to the trap and you know I'm flipping birds
2012 metallic paint on that new Bentley
Fuck what you heard, I'm the trapper of the century

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Stops signs and red lights
I hear gun shots and street fights
Ambulance sirens holler in the late night
It's murder, Compton nigga
It don't stop
Fuck the world, Dre'll blow it up
If you down throw it up
Soak it up like a sponge baby
I'm sweeping up all the crumbs daily
It all add up, it's about to get fucked the fuck up
Shut the fuck up or get fucked the fuck up
Be real nigga
Keep your eyes on your women nigga
Pass the lemon-squeezey Hennessey nigga
It's all richie
Let the mob kiss me
Affiliation is my job
Forever I'm a paid man
A brave man
I sip the Henny down to nothin'
What you know about the knock you got from dot com?
It's nothing
It's all money and cream
Gasoline so supreme it's third under the green

[Hook: JB] x2
You should get down with a nigga like me
And you should roll the town with a nigga like me
And if you feel that you can do what I can do and you pursue what I pursue
You been around with a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
You ain't in it for the money then get out the game
Motherfucker's better think before they spit out my name
I've been known to have tone, shit out the frame
Load up the clip and aim
Listen
You ain't in it for the dough yo
You're rhyming your blah
I hit you with an O you be the crime in your block
If you wanna sell a million motherfuckers then rap
You know we come through with the glaciers
You bladdidy-blah
And our homes be spacious like a mil and dot
In a platinum bracelets try to steal at your shot
Been a villian since I can remember four-wheeling the plot
Sell crack, make a mil and then stop
Feel me?

[Hook] x2
Gunshot

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
We crew hoppers, twenty-in-a-group shoppers
Don't look at the watch unless you got blue blockers
BBC boats where niggas is true yachters
I got an MBA in how to ball
Surrounded by niggas that sell more powder than y'all
Standing like statues and they proud when they fall
Til then they selling dope round the calendar
They pulling hundred grand up the valet at the mall
Walking slow, like it's a Hype Williams video
Jacob well paid--the ears got a crispy glow
Face like, fuck the world, give me hoes
So you racking up on everything with pretty toes
And fresh babes, looking like colored chalk and
Fat ass, bow-legged like she just started walking
Pass it your man so he can get the number
Once she says her name and where the fuck she come from
She got hope in eyes like she wanna go far
Like Hollywood somewhere but your chain got the stars
You walking with the his, she trying hers
She's dying of thirst, you nice with the words
She's fine with the work so you buying the furs
When you get outside the bitch died, the flying spur
Bentley four-doors from the corridors
From your young stunnas they your couriers
Later on you think of them when you toast in the VIP
Gun on your hip, just in case a niggas set trip

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
"Come go with me
I make you feel right"
That's what the dope man used to say
Bringing cocaine in the jam
"Come go with me
I'll make you feel right"
That's what all the dope men say
Bringing cocaine in the jam

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
22 niggas, two to a car
11 flagships with the three-point star
The only other ballers are them 3-point stars
We only 5'9", they think we point guards
No jumper, still at the top of the key
No wonder they thought we was shooting them 3's
Throw numbers, sell for the deuce and the three
Like Air Jordan, it's all in the wrist, turning keys
Your modern day Chardonnay sippers
We throwin' up our middles screaming fuck them other niggas
We spit it out like '94 diddy on them niggas
Ain't worried bout the cost, we know the hoes is counting figures
The games of the rich kids we know what the tricks is
We turn our backs so we can fuck each other's bitches
The lifestyle of the rich and right now
Any Given Sunday in the kitchen, white clouds―Poof!

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
"Come go with me
I make you feel right"
That's what the dope man used to say
Bringing cocaine in the jam
"Come go with me
I'll make you feel right"
That's what all the dope men say
Bringing cocaine in the jam

[Verse 3: Malice]
I lean like the tower, balancing the 'caine
Never thought I'd ever have to touch this residue again
He being me don't even count it as a shame
I'm the Clipse, I done been learned to dance when it rain
Like the gospel song, I won't complain
But I won't watch niggas cash in on my pain
Not Jessie grandson, every gram slung
A testament to my momma's tears losing her first son
Wanna know the real coke? Never been a dealer
Never glorified that, just the character it built
The game's real and you find out quick
When you want the Bentley, the Porsche ain't shit
Not a chain from Jacob, what I need is a wake up
And this pain my heart got the weight of an anchor
And still I thank the good Lord for health
And the peace that you get when you right with yourself

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
"Come go with me
I make you feel right"
That's what the dope man used to say
Bringing cocaine in the jam

Sayin' I want you to, bounce that ass

Woo

[Verse 1]
I made them laugh, I made them cry
But now the rain clouds all on the inside
They don't know how it feels to know how I feel
I try to escape from everything that is real

[Chorus 1]
Hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation
Never out of time, somewhere in my mind
There's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing
Day by day creating in my imagination

[Verse 2]
The well has run dry of all my ideas
Silence so loud, have to cover my ears
I'm closing the door, it's hurting too much
I'm runnIng away from everything I can touch

[Chorus 2]
To hide in my imagination, there is always magic waiting
Never counting time, always on my mind
There's a place that only I see, far away from all that I see
Inch by inch creating, in my imagination

[Verse 3]
I can stop it all from hurting
With this mind, I can stop the world from turning
Don't know how it feels to know how I feel
I try to escape from everything that is real

[Chorus 1]
I can hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation
Never out of time, somewhere in my mind
There's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing
Day by day creating in my imagination

[Intro: Sample]
I hear the cry of an angel
I hear the scream of a man
I hear the cry of an angel
I hear the scream of a man who will stand strong
We got London On Da Track

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got London on the Track, baby
He might go jail for serving this crack, baby
Rich the Kid, we in the trap, baby
But he might be lucky 'cause he’ll serve all of these rappers, baby (Ah)
I'm sitting up high, I'm in the nose bleed (Ayy)

Why, why would you do this to me?
It hurts if it don't seems
I'ma, I'ma block it out just by counting these knots
I'm just kidding, I think not
I'ma hold this weight down, even though it's a lot
And I'ma take off on your nigga, no astronaut
And I'm the motherfucking man, I'm not no boy
And I got a playroom if you wanna see some toys
And I got extendo, look like I got two rods
And I got a 6 Plus, look like an iPod

[Bridge]
My kids go by uh, Jacob, Kyvion, Haiti, Hayden, Amir, Mari
And I swear to God I ain't sorry, bitch

And I got some sisters that'll watch 'em like a guardian
Plus I got some elders that'll watch 'em like a guard
It don't matter if I leave, I know my bro gon' do my part

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, bitch come stumbling in my car
I'll just terminate him, then I'll leave him with a scar
I can't be no hater, bitches gambling when in Vegas

Bitch, I know the business, I been nominated lately

Hey, I'ma cook them cakes no Easy Baker
We got something to get so we need that tow truck stable
Hey, bitches see these floors and get hot
Yes, I'm living it up, my bed in the sky
Yes, I heard you're the king of the rock
But when I hit it like a hit stick I make it shock, yeah
Flip flop paint going down the street
Minks all on my floor, now that bitch look just like a sheep
Help me find love, help me find love, Stevie, I can't see
I'm a snake, you know my tail stinging, plus I'm a Bee
I might turn you up if you get right, no Mama Dee
Yeah, no Mama Dee, but
I'm spitting so hard I might just lose my teeth (Woah)
Tree top, trill lil leaf (Hah)
Baby bought the Gerby
Feed her lobster, Kirby
I don't trust you, no worry
Oops, I meant worthy
I know it's kinda hard to get the
Words I'm saying, I'm steady praying, amen
Please forgive me for my sins, please twin
I don't wanna be departed from you, you me and
You know I'm you
Hundred miles an hour, you control the coupe
Thank you for giving me these golds, no flute
Please make 'em understand that I ain't no fruit
Please make 'em understand I only fuck coochie
Please forgive me for my sins
Please, please, please forgive me
All I wanna do is win
I don't write so I don't want the pen
I promise I'm in love with my kids
I'm thankful for everything I get
Lord knows that I take care of my kin
I promise I hope it never ends

[Outro: Sample]
I hear the cry of an angel
I hear the scream of a man

[Intro]
I got dreams
Dreams to remember
X3
Oh Gravity
X2

Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down

I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is

That we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing
But we could always sing
What about the night we cried?
Because there wasn't any reason
Left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word
But you were always there with a smile
And if I say I really loved you
And was glad you came along
When you were here today
Ooh ooh ooh, for you were in my song

Hello, I miss you
I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No she gonna have my baby
Taking all that I have to take
This takings gonna shake me
People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town
Cause people's getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says
No I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and you's a drunk
But I love her like no other
And in the dark we say we don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
People call us renegades
Cause we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says
No I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and you's a drunk
But I love her like no other
And her daddy he says he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we gonna
(Whoa-a oh oh oh)
(Whoa-a oh oh oh)

People call us renegades (Whoa-a oh oh oh)
We like takin' on this town (Whoa-a oh oh oh)

No she gonna have my baby
I'm takin' all I have to take
This takings gonna shape me
(Whoa-a oh oh oh)
(Whoa-a oh oh oh)
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hand
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Oh 

[Incomprehensible] about that
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns
No, no, no, no, no
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
I just remembered that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to

Our love was comfortable and so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say "she's gonna be good for you"
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
Say, hey

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can but
I can't pretend this is the way itll stay Im just
(Trying to bend the truth)
I can't pretend Im who you want me to be, so Im
(Lying my way from you)
No no, turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside so let me go)
No no, turning back now
(Let me take back my life, Id rather be all alone)
No, turning back now
(Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see)
No no, turning back now

(The very worst part of you is me)
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk for who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin in
And now you think this person really is me and Im
(Trying to bend the truth)
'Cause the more I push the more Im pulling away 'cause Im
(Lying my way from you)
No no turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside so let me go)
No no turning back now
(Let me take back my life, Id rather be all alone)
No turning back now
(Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see)
No no, turning back now
(The very worst part of you)

(The very worst part of you is me)
This isnt what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isnt what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isnt what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this, this isnt what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
(You)
No, turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside so let me go)
No no, turning back now
(Let me take back my life Id rather be all alone)
No, turning back now
(Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see)
No no, turning back now

(The very worst part of you)

(The very worst part of you is me)

See I woke up early as hell one morning
And I noticed my stash was half gone
'Cause these fiends can't stop smokin my rocks
'Cause lately around my way these niggas been warrin'
Fightin' for teritory that's mine
'Cause these cats can't stop liquors or shots
I'ma show you right now the only reason the block is movin'
I got dubs at the price of a dime
That's why I'm on top and it don't stop
'Cause I get it so cheap no matter what I won't be losin'
Re-up spots is so hard to find

You can find me on the other side of the border
With a hundred grand in my pocket
For the first trip just pack a little bit
'Cause I'ma bring the work back by air or even by water
What ever it take to get to the crib
Gotta play it safe cause they out there
See I got so much clientele home waiting
I can't just make one trip
But I gotta get enough to supply the city
But I gotta be careful smugglin' in
Vaseline Reynolds Wrap to hide the scent
Off on the next trip while I wait for Jose
He'll bring it to me

Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh babe
Don't leave me now

How could you go?
When you know how I need you?
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh babe
Don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooooh babe
Why are you running away?
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe

[Intro]
Hello, we're Mumford & Sons

[Verse 1]
Serve God, love me and mend
This is not the end
Live unbruised, we are friends
And I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Sigh no more, no more
One foot in sea, one on shore
My heart was never pure
And you know me
And you know me

[Bridge]
But man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing

[Chorus]
Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design
An alignment to cry
Of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design
An alignment to cry
Of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design
An alignment to cry
Of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be

[Outro]
Thank you very much, cheers. How are you Shepherd's Bush Empire?

[Verse 1]
When I look in the mirror of time
Often find that I'm doing it over
But when I look at the tears from her eyes
Don't regret a single word that I've told her

And when we're distant
I'm sure you'll think things over
I hope you'll miss it
But I'll still have an open shoulder
For you to lean and laugh and cry on, little girl

[Verse 2]
How I wish that the start of the end would begin
That she'd need all that I've shown her
I know the cycle of life could begin
And in time I'd be stuck starting over

And with the distance
I hope faith don't roll over
If you don't miss it
I'll still have an open shoulder
For you to lean and laugh and cry on, little girl

[Bridge]
Why does love have to end?
Why do hearts have to break and mend?
Why do they tell me you won't be the only one?

[Outro]
They don't believe that love can last forever
Do you believe that love can last forever?
I believe that love can last forever
Do you believe that love can last forever?
I believe that love can last forever

[Chorus]
Money on the mind
Hustlin' all the time

[Spoken - Jeff Bridges]
The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What do they look like? Ships, motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then, one day, I got in...
This is a call to the colorblind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind the horizon line
Tied up in something true

Yes I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Why is it not my time?
What is there more to learn?
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return
Yes I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
Yes I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's laughing and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Intro: Joss Stone]
Mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1: Al Green, Joss Stone]
I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow (Tomorrow)
I was never told about the sorrow (Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Al Green Joss Stone, Both]
And how can you mend (Can you mend) a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me how can you stop (How can you stop?) the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man? (This broken man) (Yeah)
How can a loser ever win? (How can a loser ever win?)
Somebody please help me mend (Help me mend) my broken heart
And let me live again (Let me live again)
La, la, la-la-la, mm-mm
And how can you mend this broken man? Ooh-ooh, ooh
And how can you stop the rain from falling down? Mm-mm
And how can you stop the sun from shining down on here?
Tell me what makes the world go round, round
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Al Green, Joss Stone, Both]
I can still feel the breeze (Fell the breeze, yes)
That rustles through the trees (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And misty memories of days gone by (Mm-hmm)
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow?
So... (It's just not right, it's just not right)

[Chorus: Al Green, Joss Stone, Both]
How can you mend (Tell me how to fix this man) a broken heart?
(And mine is) (Mm-hmm, yeah)
How can you stop the rain (I don't know) from falling down?
(How?) (Hey, hey)
How can you stop the sun from shining?
Can you stop that old sun from shining?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
What makes the world the world go round? (Round, round)
And sometime I have to say, yeah, say
La, la, la, la-la, la-la, oh-ho, yeah (La-la, la, la)
La, la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Oh, la, la, oh)
Tell me
Help me mend my, my broken heart (Help me, please)
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna live again, baby
(You gonna, so you gonna, you gonna, you gonna pretend, baby)
How can you mend (How can you mend?) this broken man?
(I just wanna know) (Somebody tell me) (I wanna help you out)
How can a loser ever win? Baby
(Maybe a little kiss, maybe a little help, just a little loving for you now)
Help me mend my... (I'll help you, baby, just let me help you)
This old broken heart (Help me mend it)
I think I... (Help me kiss you better)
I believe I... (Help me love you better, ooh-ooh)
I feel like I got to, I feel like I wanna live again
(Feel it for me now, feel it for me now, feel it for me now)
How can you mend this broken heart?
(Somebody please tell me) (How can you mend this broken man?)
How can you stop the rain from falling down?

What's wrong girl
You don't treat me like you used to do
Everything about you is brand new
You've changed
It's mighty strange
You've lost the greatest smile and you won't tell me why
It's plain to see the love light's gone now in your eyes
The world we built is dangling on a broken rope
But I've got hope oh oh oh I've got hope
I hope and pray that one day girl you'll see the light
And then you'll know that all I want is just to treat you right
Baby just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby just to treat you right (treat you right)

The world we built is dangling on a broken rope
But I've got hope oh oh oh
I hope and pray that one day girl you're gonna see the light
And then you'll know that all I want is just to treat you right
Baby just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby just to treat you right
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal

Your love pours down on me, surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame god for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year
God i can't do this any more
Though ill be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone
{repeatedly punch the air bit}
If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?
{repeatedly punch the air bit} again
If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

Press play, fast forward
Nonstop, we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the signs
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all abouts
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day (that day 

[x?])

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back
Look back, at the faded silhouette
Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger

Now, we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all abouts
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day (that day 

[x?])

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back
Look back, at the faded silhouette
Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past

[Principal]
Doom, are you awake?

[Dr. Doom]
Yes, but what do you want?

[Principal]
You fool, it's a miracle that you didn't kill Costez as well as yourself. So, before you cause greater harm—

[Dr. Doom]
Get out of here! This is just a minor disappointment. I shall overcome it

[Reed]
The failure of DOOM's experiment did not end his tragedy
For a few days later, his bandages were removed

[Nurse]
There. Aah! How horrible, that face

[Dr. Doom]
What have I done to myself? My face is...hideous! He made me hurry my experiment! Now I must hide my face from all mankind. But he will pay. Oh, how he will pay!

[Reed]
So after his face was ruined, he just seemed to disappear

[Commissioner Robbins]
Why did DOOM threaten just to—

[Reed]
Well, like I said he just disappeared. I'll never forget that day
Darling, you can be so unforgiving
You can be so unloving
You can be misunderstanding
But i don't know how to feel without your love...

So tell me what to do do do do dodododo do do

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh

It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh

But you still sleep with your back to me
Is me and you or is it me and the moon?

O baby, i thought that you forgave me
I thought that you still loved me
Don't you need me...

I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
I want it forever
It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky-e-oh

It's a lovely night with that look in your eye-e-oh

But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you or is it really nothing?
I'm not alone, I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now, they do right now
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is at all
When Autumn comes, it doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is at all
I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over the counter test
For loneliness, for loneliness like this
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is
Something's different and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is
Friends, check
Money, check
Well-slept, check
Opposite sex, check
Guitar, check
Microphone, check
Messages waiting on me
When I come home, check
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need
I'm putting you, baby
I'm putting you right out of my mind
I'm putting you, baby
I'm putting you right out of my mind
So tired of running after you, girl
And being one and one half steps behind
Go, tell your friends now
Go, tell your friends what Johnny did
Go, tell your friends
Go, tell your friends just what Johnny did
If they don't tell you that you're crazy, baby
Lord, they're as messed up as you is
Let me play my guitar, people
Let me play my guitar, people
I'm putting you
I'm putting you, baby
I'm putting you out of my mind
Mind, mind, mind
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
Right out, right out of my mind
Right out, right out of my mind
Oh, my mind
So tired of running after you, girl
And being one and one half steps
And being one and one half steps
And being one and one half steps behind
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, oh (oh)

Picket lines (sister) and picket signs (sister)
Don't punish me (sister) with brutality (sister)
Talk to me (sister), so you can see (sister)

Oh, what's going on (what's going on)
What's going on (what's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (what's going on)
Oh, what's going on (what's going on)
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Picket lines (brother) and picket signs (brother)
Don't punish me (brother) with brutality (brother)
Come on, talk to me (brother), so you can see (brother)

What's going on (what's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (what's going on)
Tell me what's going on (what's going on)
I'll tell you what's going on (what's going on)
Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
And I tried to call-been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me

Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Taking my own advice
I'm giving up tonight good luck to you
And the king

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know life as the man
Livin' life as the man on the side

Drink a six pack and then you play some ball
Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
Two hundred seventy five pounds, that you can't forget
Heart attack, heart attack man
Spend all your money on your health insurance plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Keep on getting bigger, because you know that you can
Why do you force yourself on top of that girl?
Laugh with all your buddies, because it's a man's man's world
Someday that shit will come back to you
You've been throwing your weight around and your shit is through
Heart attack, heart attack man
Going nowhere, got no master plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Heart attack
Weighs in at two seventy five
Yeh, my man is lucky to be alive
Smokin' and drinkin' too
My man, the heart attack man, is gonna be running over you
Got no God damn respect
Had to put the big big bitch ass in check
Heart attack, heart attack man
Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam
Heart attack, heart attack man
Time to change your ways heart attack man
{What do we know about partying or anything else?}

[Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me

[Verse 2]
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go

[Bridge]
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

[Verse 3]
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

[Outro]
Like Ben
Like Ben

[Verse 1]
I'm looking for a chateau, twenty-one rooms but one will do
Looking for a chateau, twenty-one rooms but one will do
I don't wanna buy it
I just wanna rent it for a minute or two
I met an old mistake walking down the street today
Met an old mistake walking down the street today
I didn't wanna be mean about it
But I didn't have one good thing to say

[Chorus]
West L.A. fadeaway
West L.A. fadeaway
Little red light on the highway
Big green light on the speedway

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Had a steady job hauling items for the mob
Had a steady job hauling items for the mob
Pay was pathetic
But it's a shame those boys couldn't be more copacetic

[Verse 3]
I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
Need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
Name, address, phone number
Lord, and just how far to go

[Chorus]
Well, West L.A. fadeaway
West L.A. fadeaway
Little red light on the highway
Big green light on the speedway

[Instrumental]

I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Verse 2]
My bones hurt from all the shows
But I don't feel the pain, 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in
Then I'm okay
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage
Oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus]
You can't have my heart and, you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Bridge]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose, if you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body, and don't stop the party

[Chorus]
You can't have my heart and (help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[Outro]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, girl
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Want you want with my body, girl
Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo doo

Walk, little walk, small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell 'em all just what I want
That street, two streets, I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings

Count high low, don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm the Superman and it's my show
One shoe, two, gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, yeah
I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo doo
(These are one of those times when we're gonna have a lot of fun)
I run, they run, everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggyback a-ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride

One two three, close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls, I'll color on 'em all
Draw until I've broken every law

Yeah, yeah
I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ah, ha ha ha
Ahh
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this

Some of them want to use you

Out of my mind on Saturday night
1970 rollin' in sight
Radio burnin' up above
Beautiful baby, feed my love
All night till I blow away
All night till I blow away

So
Sure
Well, I'm standing here, freezing, outside your golden garden
Uh got my ladder, leaned up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned to run away together
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me...
I think I better wait till tomorrow
I think I better wait till tomorrow
I think I better wait till tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right, so until tomorrow, goodnight
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you hang me up this way ?
Oh, on the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today
Now I'm standing here like some turned down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed mind of you
And you keep tellin' me that ah...
I think we better wait till tomorrow
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Don't have to wait, Don't have to wait
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right, until tomorrow, goodnight, oh
Ow ! Dolly Mae, girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree ?
Click bang, what a hang, your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
Won't be around, Won't be around, Won't be around...
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right

[something] my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap

(chorus)
Hustler
Hustler
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
(kid drop in)
Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there
I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?

What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down
Out my face, fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew
And I'm a hustler

H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........
Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid
My education's low but I got long dough
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me!
A hustler
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack......
I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
I've got a plan
I'm gonna find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't it remind you just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
'This won't last longer than the rest of the day'
But you're wrong this time

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing
Tonight

Stop trying to figure it out
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be the back porch poet with a book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never gonna find the perfect rhyme
For 'heavier things'
I am a veteran of the war
I up and joined the army back an 1964
At sixteen I just had to be a man at any cost
I volunteered for Vietnam where I got my leg shot off

I recall a quote form a movie
That said, "Who's more a man
Than a man with a reason
That's worth dyin' for"

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line
When it comes to gettin' ahead

They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
They put a gun in my hand and said, "Shoot until he's dead"
But it's hard to kill when "Please I'm your friend"
Echoes through your head
Brought up in church
Taught no man should take another's life
But then put in the jungle
Where life has no price, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line
When it comes to gettin' ahead

Back in the world the paper reads today
Another war is in the brewing
But what about the lives of yesterday
And the many happy families that have been ruined

My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie too
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
They laugh and say, "Quit braggin'
'Bout the war you should have never been in"

But my mind is so brain-washed
I'd probably go back and do it again
I walk the neighborhood parading my purple heart
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line
When it comes to gettin' ahead

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
Now I stand at the back of the line
When it comes to gettin' ahead

Would you believe I do?
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line
When it comes to gettin' ahead
My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm

[Chorus]
What you doin' on your back, aah

Hope
Hope you know this isn't gonna be anymore professional

[Verse 1]
Tell me a line - make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right

It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away
(Go away)

[Chorus 1]
Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just how I fell in love
Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just how I fell in love
(In love...)

[Verse 2]
Oh this is the time, the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes, dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
(Yeah we know)
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

[Chorus 2]
But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
Oh

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)

[Verse 3]
Turn on the light - make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
(What an awful sight)

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your love of fights
All night!

[Chorus 3]
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
Oh
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love
(Real love)

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)
I was always right
About the morning
Okay, I'm an old shoe

Danced above the blaze
Never stopped crawling
Over the black dunes

And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now, too?

I'm always one
Without a warning
Old days re-appear

Lift away, past the gate
Desert keeps forming
Underneath The black moon

And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now, too?
I shouldn't share and I'm trying to be keen
And I'll travel the world to the American pier

But baby, that's not the point
Baby, that's not the point
But baby, that's not the point
Baby, that's not the point

You take my hand, tell me to forget my fears
You tell me every day girl to be a man

But baby, that's not the point
Baby, that's not the point
But baby, that's not the point
Baby, that's not the point

I can't forget my fears
I can't forget my fears
I can't forget my fears
I can't forget my fears
I got my sights set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will
Never be tamed
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowing
When something is right
I feel like I must have known you
In another life
'cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus:]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can rest till then (a-whoa a-whoa)
Now I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
(a-whoa a-whoa)
Now I can't wait to see you again
And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke their bank is injured
And bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner
And I'll be smiling encase they take a picture
Uh, I'm smoking weed drinking liquor make a hundred
Off a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I told 'em pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business don't play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone
All kinda of hoes in my car
They wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off
Most of these niggas just talk ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it's a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No N.B.A. they say I'm a baller
Live for today, stunt like my father
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
And blow it all away (way)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone
(Wonderland winter wonderland wonderland)
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight oh we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married we say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

(In the meadow we can build a snowman)
And pretend he's a circus clown
We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
Oh when it snows ain't it filling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

(Wonderland wonderland)
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love, she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, 'Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof'
I asked her her name, she said 'blah-blah-blah'
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, 'How do you like the show?'
She said, 'I was very amused'
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, 'Do ya have a man?' she tried to pretend
She said, 'No I don't, I only have a friend'
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, and then I called again
I said, 'Yo, who was that?' 'Oh, he's just a friend'
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
'Yo, could you tell me where is door three?'
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend
Ayyy boi
Well she come around here
Just about midnight
Lord, she make me feel so good
She make me feel alright

And she spell her name G-L-O-R-IIIIII-A, G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A
And that spells, that spells uh Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
I said uh Gloria
Yeah yeah

Now she come around to my house
Just about midnight
And uh she walks up to my street
And knocks on my door
She come up my stairs, now, can you dig it
And knock on my one more time door again
She comes across my room
And I'm layin' up there sleeping
She kiss me on my belly
She make me feel like plum jelly
And said our uh, hey baby
Hey hey hey hey baby
Whoa baby
I come to, come to make love to you
And I say uh, "hey girl what's your name?"
Said "that don't make no difference anyway
Well in the meantime, while I play to you
You can call me Gloria
Gloria now, Gloria, Gloria
And she make me feel so good
Whoa and it feel so good baby
Ohh make it feel so good, ha
Make me lose my voice
Yeah... it's alright baby
Hey baby

And I called her, I say woo-ee, yeah
Yeah, you sure make me feel good, baby
I'm sure some of y'all out there got some girls name Gloria
Like Mitch Mitchell has one name Gloria
And I seen it all happen
You know, we was at a scene one night
And I seen this little boog-a-bear come around
She look like a draggin' in her carlisle
Her hair was like, that long
But anyway I see her walk up the stair
Walk up to his room and she said
"Hey baby, I think my job is to make love to you"
And he played his drums...
Yeah, yeah
A ha ha ha, you see, ah I gotta explain this to you
He didn't know she was coming, all right
Noel Redding also got a girl name Gloria
She looks something like an alley bad boy, ain't nothin' wrong with that
One time Noel was playing with himself
And she come knockin' on his door
And little Noel gonna take a solo on the bass, then
Showing that he appreciates her love
Even though she did look like home made sin
And her breath smelt like wet pussy
And while all that was happening
I looked out the window
And here comes the man with all the groovy grass
And here we are freakin' out man
You know we be gettin' into somethin' good
And we layin' back, freaking and smoking and joking
All a sudden, I hear the man coming
The man the cops they came in, oh, Lord, have mercy

I said hey Gloria
I think it's time to get the hell outta here
I said Gloria get off my chest
It's time to get outta here
I'm talking about G-L-O-R-IIIIII-A, G-L-O-R-I-A. G-L-O-R-I-A
Yeah yeah, make me feel so good
Yeah, make me feel so good, baby
I'm talking about talkin' about, talkin' about, talkin' about Gloria!
Wa-hey!
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Yeah
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an Island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child baby

You better listen when I say

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days
Ha ha ha

I said I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time

Hey hey hey

I don't take no for an answer

Question no
Yeah
Well it's that Westside killa bitch, all about my paper
One hand on my guap, screaming finger fuck a hater
2 hands on my lap two bitches ass naked
300 on the drop, and I'm still your bitch favorite
I want her, I get her don't need her
Change them like seasons, fall of when I leave her
Yeah I'm cashing out, and I'm riding with that Nina
Dick game ether, she does speaking no English (Ariba!)
Wilding goin crazy
Yeah, we're in the party and the party getting faded
Already fucked up, I dont know how I made it
And I'mma need a driver, cause the driver intoxicated
A nigga can't tame me, two ladies entertain me
Pull my money out, now the club rainin'
Lemon and Ciroc, now my face changing
Looking like cable, watch 'em standing on the table, and I

Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
We in this bitch, we-we in this bitch
Two seater, bitch I ain't in a Beetle
Just put 4's on the ghost, but I don't need 'em
Rich game, no shirt, no hole beater
Hotter than the mufuckin devil red Beamer
Wrist gleamer, all about my own demeanor
Said he from the land, but niggas said they never seen ya
Put ice in Adele for no reason
And she catch my balls, like gold keepers
Trippy more, hella bass
Put the bump in your face; why you all up in my space?
Bitch back back, keep my house, cars up to date
Got five hoes with me like I'm on a Elimidate
Nigga don't hate, my money been straight
King gold chains, on the license plate
As I valet the ride
2 chains on, no lie

Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and the party gettin faded, faded, faded
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and the party gettin faded, faded, faded
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and the bitches gettin faded, faded, faded
Wilding goin crazy, yeah we in the party and these niggas going crazy, man I...
La da da da da, la la
Oh yeah, yeah

Where there's no sun, there is that girl
She is the one that spins my world
When I am down, she makes it better
When there are clouds, she change the weather
My wishing well, oh my peace and my glory
As a fairytale, then she is my story
When I feel drained, her love is like a fountain
And when I'm weak, she can move mountains

I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss, no, this way
I never felt joy this way
'til my lady Sunday came

Oh, I am her ground, and she is my sky
If life is a road then she is my ride
When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling
When I am sick, she brings me healing
Whenever I call, she is right there
And when I fall, she says a prayer
When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it
Introducing Mrs Music
I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss, no, this way
I never felt joy this way
'til my lady Sunday came

La da da da, Miss Got-Me, Miss Righteous, Miss Hallelujah
La da da da, take my hand and be my Mrs Future
La da da da, 'cause your loving makes the groove much better
As long as we got music, as long we got music
As long as we got music, we'll dance forever

I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss, no, this way
I never felt joy this way
'til my lady Sunday came

I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss, no, this way
I never felt joy this way
'til my lady Sunday came

I never felt a love, no, this way (I never felt a love this way)
I never felt a kiss, no, this way (No, no, said I never felt a kiss, no, no)
I never felt joy this way (No, no, no, I never, felt joy this way)
'til my lady Sunday came ('til my lady Sunday came to me)
I'm so glad, glad
That I would shout
Alright come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky smooth perfume
Right my little pooh bear
Wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air
Kick it in the sand?
I'll say I told you so but
You just gonna cry
You just wanna know those
Peanut butter vibes
My my simple sir
This ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and
Tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place
No I can't take this place
I just wanna go where
I can get some space
Truth be told
I been there I done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile
Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)

Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like the Roman chariot race now
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
(You drive like an ace now, you drive like an ace)

And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)
Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
(Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry this today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

Where have all the people gone my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

I thought I heard a young man morn this morning
I thought I heard a young man morn today
I thought I heard a young man morn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
Guess it doesn't matter anyway
My insides all turn to ash
So slow
And blow away as I collapsed
So cold
A black wind took them away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
I used to be my own protection
But not now
'Cause my path has lost direction
Somehow
A black wind took you away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night
And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
So now you're gone
And I was wrong
I never knew what it was like
To be alone on a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day
(On a Valentine's Day)
I used to be my own protection
(On a Valentine's Day)
But not now
(On a Valentine's Day)
'Cause my mind has lost direction
(On a Valentine's Day)
Somehow
(On a Valentine's Day)
I used to be my own protection
(On a Valentine's Day)
But not now
(On a Valentine's Day)
'Cause my mind has lost direction
(On a Valentine's Day)
Somehow
Still going strong (He’s still going strong)
Yeah, yeah (He’s still going strong)
Remember Ned Stark, he was a lot of fun. (So fun)
But he didn’t make it past Season One (Oh no)
Robert Baratheon was part of that crew
But he never made it to Season Two
The King of the North was cool, you said (So cool)
Another favorite that ended up dead (He’s dead)
You thought that Joffrey had to survive
He ain’t in the credits for Season Five (Season Five)
Baby, you know I’m the man for all seasons
Characters get cut for various reasons (Ow ow)
Some people’s parts just ain’t that long
But not me (Not me, not me, not me)
I’m still going strong (He’s still going strong)
Soon Come
Everytime I call
They tell me that you're soon come soon come
I call you at your home
They tell me that you're soon come
I don't like hanging around
Or to be pushed around
I've got business puttin' down
I don't like the soon come soon come
I call you on the phone
They tell me that you're soon come soon come
I even call you at your home
They tell me that you're soon come soon come

Don't like it

Am a mountain
I am a tall tree
Ooooh, I am a swift wind
Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley
Ooooh, I am a vision
And I can see clearly
If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say
Chorus
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it, mmmmmm
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it, mmmmmm
I'm the world's greatest
(the worlds greatest, worlds greatest , for ever )
I am a giant
I am an eagle
Ooh, I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people
Ooh, I am a helping hand
I am a hero
If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say
Chorus
In the ring of life i'll rain love (i will rain)
And the world will notice a king (oooohhhhh yahhhhh)
When there is darkness i'll shine a light (shine a light)
And views of success reflect in me
Repeat Chorus to fade
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
And a feeling that I never
Never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
And a feeling that I never
Never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Verse 1]
Wandering afar and seeking (Seeking)
One time you're looking for I-don't-know
But, then you find it
Please, won't you tell me so, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Now every young fool
(Young fool)
Throughout the land
(Throughout the land)
Looking for someone who understands (Someone)
While all the old ones
(All the old ones)
They discredit this
(They discredit this)
Talkin' 'bout the good old days
That they miss

[Chorus]
See how blind you've been (See how blind you've been)
Sow how the world you livin' in is changing (Changing)
Lord have mercy
(Changing)
All around us is greed and hate
We better wake up or soon it will be too late

[Verse 3]
I guess what they want
(I guess what they want)
Is some peace of mind
But, I know it's very hard to find (Very hard)
You can't borrow it
(No, you can't borrow it)
From strength
So mine got to come from within

[Verse 4]
We oughta stop and think (We oughta stop and think)
The signs show the brink of destruction (Signs show the brink)
(Destruction)
Now, everybody stop to take heed
Or they'll lose someone they really, really needed

[Verse 5]
See how confused you are
Everyone near and far, is seeking
(Seeking)
While I was looking for I-don't-know
When you find it, please tell me, tell me
Won't you tell me

[Chorus]
See how blind you've been (See how blind you've been)
Sow how the world you livin' in is changing (See how the world you live in is changing)
Lord, have mercy
(Changing)
All around us is greed and hate
We better wake up or soon it will be too late
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run
And I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely
Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out baby)
I had never wished to ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby)
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, "Well anyway"
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said, "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said, "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked
I just wanna be funny
Looks like the jokes on me
So call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now

I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man
I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing
With a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been
And for the state I'm in
I'm still alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone
So I play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
I don't want to be alone
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
And since you're busy every minute
I just stay at home
I make believe you care
I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
An I the stranger in the rain
I am alone
And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We came so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
I don't want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the Earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We came so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
I don't want to be alone
Gone, but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

[Intro]
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

[Chorus]
Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

Thank god I've been blessed with a patient mind
Because what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

[Bridge]
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

[Verse 1]
She dances in his sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep

She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus] x2
But she's a slave to the rhythm
But she's a slave to the rhythm of
But she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
Sir, "I must be home tonight"

She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

[Chorus] x2
But she's a slave to the rhythm
But she's a slave to the rhythm of
But she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard, just to make her way
For the man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, she dare'd not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus] x3 

[to fade]
But she's a slave to the rhythm
But she's a slave to the rhythm of
But she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
So reach in the cooler and pass me a beer
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
I wish you would roll a new blunt
And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
So reach in the cooler and pass me a beer
I wish you would roll a new blunt

And pass me a beer
Good weed I bring like a cottonmouth king
Good weed for Christmas, so pass me a beer
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say something
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
People on the street, they panic and start running
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing, like, "What did he say?"

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real
Ooh you're a holiday , such a holiday
Ooh you're a holiday , such a holiday

It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head

Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

De de de de de de de de de de de de de
De de de de de de de de de de de de de
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

Ooh you're a holiday , ev'ry day , such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say , and I say you're a holiday
It's something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones , throwing stones

De de de de de de de de de de de de de de

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me

Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I know

[Verse 1:]
Yeah
You know I do it for the city and everybody descending
The generals and lieutenants salute high representors
Since I've been sittin' a minute no-everybody be missin'
Me walking off in the club
Gettin' everybody attention
When I'm out record with spinnin'
They start it from the beginning
Get bottles of Christian Remy
And pass it out to the women
Pull out a stack of 20
Throw it up to the ceiling
Watch it fall to the floor
Start throwin' some more
Has anybody you know
Whatever part it you go
With me in the VIP
Know that shit was outta control
If I pull up in a Mercedes
I hop in out of the road
Continue hatin' but hey
I'm the fly-est guy that you know
Ay, East coast, West coast, me in way south
I keep a fire marshal at the go stressed out
Mine stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down
Been a minute in the city since it really went down, man

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me

[Verse 2:]
I'm gettin' calls every evening, sayin' the streets need me
I'm at it just as soon as I make it pimpin' believe me
Niggas talkin' greasy but they don't wanna see me
They know where to find me, soon as they release me
Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat freeze
One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four
Nigga, five Stacks, go tell me bring ten more
And Lamborghinis and Apollos
They see me they screamin' holla
The robbers follow the ballers, so peg it soon my proudest
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter
Long as I be sittin' still, niggas still ain't cower
Atlanta you know I run it, everybody is Spanish
They gotta stay in their houses like everybody were punished
Tell them they to quit frontin' and them suckas sit down
Let em know the king comin' and he shut this shit down

[Chorus:]
They say the city ain't the same in a night like die
Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet
I know you Miss Me
I know you Miss Me
I know I Know
The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin'
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
I know you Miss Me

[Bridge:]
And every time I take the city back
And wear my crown, nigga give me that, that, that

And I do my thang
Stack my millis
Now it time for me to bring back my city, ay

Backstreet's back, alright
Frosty the snowman, had a dick of snow
He could only fuck a bitch if her pussy was real cold

Frosty was frustrated, but that's how the cards was dealt
When a girl would pass with a big hot ass, his dick would surely melt

Spring will be here and his dick will disappear, like a ice cube in a parking lot
Frosty tried to fuck this girl named dot but her pussy was too hot

Frosty the snowman was never able to come, he tried to fuck a queer, the sun would appear and frosty had to run

Now its time for Frosty's dick to disappear (say what)
He'll say goodbye but don't you cry, he'll fuck you again next year
Different

This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other

Dear diary, it's happening again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothing to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

Why, why do I have to lie?
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl
Dear diary, it's happening again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who Cleopatra pleas
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothing to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

Dear diary, it's happening again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear

Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothing to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that? Yeah
What's wrong with that?
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back

We're so hard, I was so hard that they can't chew
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

Dear diary, it's happening again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe

Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
I've these dreams i'm
Walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is
As it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand
6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling hearing "wrapped around your finger" on the
Radio
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh make me a red cape
I wanna be superman
Oh, if only my life was more like
1983
All these things would be more like they were at the
Start of me
Had it made in 83
Thinking bout my brother ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother john
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand
6 feet small
And smiling cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed
Oh well
Well these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh make me a red cape
I wanna be superman
Oh, if only my life was more like
1983
All these things would be more like they were at the
Start of me
If my life was more like
1983
I'd plot a course to the source of the purest little part of me
And most my memories
Have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox
When came the day that it got
Thrown away and don't you think I should have had some say
In that decision
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me onto one
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
You're just gonna get my back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me, tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain+
You got me washed out, washed out, color drained
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
You're just gonna get my back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

[Verse 1]
You say that you’re watching the birds out the window
Well I’ve got a bird you can watch
You ain’t gotta act like you’re borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
And what’s it to you if it’s Wednesday at noon
And I’ve traded my iced tea for scotch

[Chorus]
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

[Verse 2]
You ain’t gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear’s on the line
They ain’t mine
I ain’t gonna ask who's been mowing your grass
So you ain’t gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your mini blinds

[Chorus]
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer (Oh-oh)

[Bridge]
Don’t ask me if I go to church
I won’t ask if your husband is still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street

[Chorus]
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

[Outro]
You nosey bitch
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
And Momma just hung her head and said

"Son, Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone."
Well, well

"Hey Mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Heard them talking Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
Dealing in debt, and stealing in the name of the Lord"
Mama just hung her head and said
"Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Hey, Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone."
Uh

"Hey Mama, I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bills
Hey Mama, folks say that Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth"
And Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said

"Son, Papa was a rolling stone
(Well, well, well, well)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Lone, lone, lone, alone

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
I said, Papa was a rolling stone, yes he was
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone.."
My daddy was
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Verse 1]
I've got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
I done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
My high heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
And I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
I got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
And I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
And I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness (Summertime sadness )
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Do you think about me when you’re all alone?
The things we used to do we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

If you need to see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy can’t you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free…
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
You hold your truth so purely
Well swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
And this cup of yours tastes holy

But a brush with the Devil can clear your mind
And strengthen your spine
But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home

Spare my sins for the ark
I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad but I'm not a fraud
I'd set out to serve the Lord

But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I love
Under the sun, under the sun
But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
Fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head
Let's live while we are young
While we are young, while are young
While we are young

[Verse 1]
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you Babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooooh Babe
Ooooh Baby Blue
Ooooh Babe

[Verse 2]
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you

Because I
Because I
Because I
Because I
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I
Because I
Because I
Because I

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak

I've been infected
They're manifested
I've been infected
They're manifested

[Verse 1]
Everyone's feelin' pretty
Its hotter than July
Tho' the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us
Even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonite there'll be a party
On the corner, at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jammin it
'Til the break of dawn
See nobody ever told me
That you would be jammin' it
'Til the break of dawn
We'll be jammin' it
Jammin' it, jammin' it
Jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join the fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze, through our fingers slip away

Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the One
Now's the time for celebration
Cause we've only just begun

[Chorus]
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me "Am I happy?"
Well, as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Cause we've all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
And join as children in JAH
When you're movin' in the positve
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')

I feel so good, everybody's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute, baby, it could happen to you

[Chorus]
And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
You gotta gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' every day

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I feel so good, everybody's getting higher
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day, nothing went too good
Now I'm gonna relax just like everybody should

[Chorus]
And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
You gotta gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme, gimme some lovin' (Gimme, gimme some lovin')

[Outro]
Whether your name is Linda, whether your name is Sue
Whether your name is Deborah, well, you know what to do
Gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
You know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? 

[(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 

[(ooh, ooh)]
Or do you not think so far ahead? 

[(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 

[(ooh)]

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you
Ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
You know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? 

[(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 

[(ooh, ooh)]
Or do you not think so far ahead? 

[(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 

[(ooh)]

Yes, of course I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
Till it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead? 

[(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 

[(ooh, ooh)]
Or do you not think so far ahead? 

[(ahead)]
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 

[(ooh)]
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooo-ooo, hoo-ooo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah

I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
Talkin' bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl

If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor

Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus]
Dance the night away

Dance the night away

Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Verse 2]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor (Hey)
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more

We certainly are underspoken and understanding
But there's a lot of things unsaid as well
We shout and argue and fight, and work it on out
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
What I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
(Na na na na)

[Ludacris] + (The Game)
I just touched down in killa Cali, strapped up my boots
Got scooped up by Game so I hopped up in the Coupe
(Ahh, whattup nigga?) What the hell is goin on?
I'm tryin to ease back and get my head in the zone
(Then where the fuck you tryin to go?) Nigga this yo' city
Anywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties
So fool mash the gas, the night is young
All bullshit aside I'm tryin to have some fun
Hit the hop in Lakewood, or ride down Slausson
Or the casino, they say it's just like Compton (ha ha)
Really doesn't matter, long as shots don't rang out
(Nigga I stay strapped, I don't wanna pull the thang out)
Well keep the heat heat right up under the seat
And let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin to eat
But check your rearview mirror, I swear somebody's followin
Rollin in that dark blue SS Impala and
All up on the bumper, man I'm just sayin
Tell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin)
He sped up around and drove right in front of us
Could be one-time just tryin to bust one of us
'Til he smashed the brakes and we almost hit him
Throwin signs out the window like somethin was wrong wit him
Before we jump out and get ready to clown
(Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go down)

[Chorus: Ludacris] + (The Game)
Keep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep
(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga
(Call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Call up the homies, it's about to go down?
(Yeah, call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Yeah that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go DOWN

[The Game] + (Ludacris)
Somebody tell Luda I'm on the way now (aight)
Just stepped one size 12 Air Force One in the A-Town (ha ha ha)
And you know where I'm headed
To the Lennox Mall to get it done head to toe NWA style (do it)
Keep it gangsta from the waist down
And this chrome trey-pound got me feelin Atlanta Brave now (right)
Disturbin' Tha Peace, I'll let the lead spray
I'm startin to love this place, they even got red clay (okay)
Hit a different strip club e'ry day (yeah)
And I don't make it rain, it's a hurricane on the way (ha ha ha)
And I got the A-Town pump
It'll make your whole body do the A-Town stomp (woo!)
Then it's off to the Waffle House
And pancake mix ain't the only thing comin out her mouth
And her 42 D's comin out her blouse
Her baby daddy comin in (Game, get out the house, and)

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Yeah, I'm in a real-life movie, so this is take three
When Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z
Superbowl super hoes, robbers on stroll
So I put the call in to Willy Northpole

[Willy Northpole] + (Ludacris)
Woo, big homie I got ya, stick to you like a cactus
Welcome to the Bird City, Chris take off your jacket
I know you kinda used to big booties in the club
But ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood
I see a couple thugs with some bitch tendencies
My town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)
Haters wanna stop 'em and I really wanna pop 'em
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)
We in South Phoenix, niggas Africa bang
Matter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)
Cause I see some niggas starin at us with a lame frown
I'ma call up the homies (it's about to go DOWN)

[Chorus: Ludacris] + (Willy Northpole)
Keep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep
(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga
(Call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Call up the homies, it's about to go down?
(Yeah, call up the homies, it's about to go down)
Yeah that's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds
Nigga call up the homies, it's about to go DOWN
Okay, I go to sleep in the morning
Been counting money all night
I did it all on my own, so
These cars I'm gon' buy
Them niggas hated on me
I was all the way in Dubai
Gettin' Lambo doors sky high
Told that bitch's bitch it's no ties
Redrum, murder game
These niggas gay like Novocane
My niggas Gudda like bowling lanes
Like Pedro, they vote for me
Two Asian bitches, they Siamese
So high nigga look Chinese
She bite the head like Ozzy
Freddy Krueger money you only see in your dreams
H-Town, ball hard like my name Hakeem
Olajuwon, James Harden
Y'all niggas new to the scene
And that's my nigga, supper club
Need a new liver
Pop, pop bottles on all these bitches
Bitch ass niggas can't even get in
Ripley's, please believe me
That Justin Bieber my neighbor really
Ain't gotta lie, these niggas feel me
My bars up, like poppin' wheelies
They want beef cause my neck's chilly
Got a bad white bitch like Iggy
Iggy Pop, rockstar livin'
I'm a flyin' nigga, shoutout to Philly
King shit, your bitch
She all up on my dick
I get crazy pussy, psychiatrist
All about my paper like journalists
Killer flow, I earned this shit
We ball for real like tournaments
On the jet no turbulence
Straight flexin,' I'm so bent
No lie, no lie
Said I ain't never told no lie
Say fuck you if you hate me
My real fans gon' ride
Got my own shoe, clothing line
Own a label, who tryin' sign?
Niggas trying to turn up
But don't overdose like Limbaugh
Hypocrites and all bias
I provide ya at your whole Vajira
I can bless ya, no church attire
Pray to God I don't die tryin'
What's a stone to a big giant?
What's fire if you can't ignite it?
I'm fed up like FBI
Y'all niggas late, colored people time, nigga

[Intro]
On you
On you

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I‘ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone

[Outro]
On you
On you
On you
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today
Aha-ahh

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
Yoohoo-ooh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
Yoohoo-ooh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Well, he feels like an elephant
Shakin' his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about
Being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim

And it’s not like Mister Shook to get shy
When they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down
In the dark down there
He’s not too easily scared

He’s got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now
Coming down the stairs

(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing
When they saw him again
That’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)
It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna' be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you
What's been on my mind

I wanna make up right na na na
I wanna make up right na na na
Wish we never broke up right na na na
We need to link up right na na na

I wanna make up right na na na
I wanna make up right na na na
Wish we never broke up right na na na
We need to link up right na na na

Girl, I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show our selfs that night even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can it be the way it was
'Cause you were my homie, lover, and friend
I wanna make up right na na na
I wanna make up right na na na
Wish we never broke up right na na na
We need to link up right na na na

I wanna make up right na na na
I wanna make up right na na na
Wish we never broke up right na na na

I can't lie
I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by
I miss you much
'Til i get you back I'm gonna cry
Yes I miss you much
You are the apple of my eye
Girl, I miss you much

One that would grind with me

I want you to fly with me

He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is down
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger, given the circumstance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, I don't understand but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
I'm self deceiving but please

Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
When I see you
I run out of words to say
I wouldn't leave you
'Cause you're that type of girl to make me stay

I see the guys tryna holla, girl I don't wanna bother you
'Cause you're independent and you got my attention
Can I be your baby father? Girl, I just wanna show you
That I love what you are doin' hun

I see you in the club, you gettin' down girl
I wanna get with you, yeah
I see you in the club, you showin' thugs love

Kardinal told you, whether the sky blue or yellow

Hourglass shape make a place go 'woo!'
Waistline makes my soldier salute

High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin' in the fast lane, eyes like an angel
Goddess, watch my gal and how she undress

Spotless, heartless, bad to the bone

Lames don't know how to talk to you

Say, ahaaw, I love to love you, baby Sing!
(Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby)
Put your hands together
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again 'cause I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
And if I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life

Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Got to get you into my life

Hey Brother, there's an endless road to re-discover
Hey Sister, Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Ooooh if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey Brother, do you still believe in one another?
Hey Sister, do you still believe in love I wonder?
Ooooh if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I far from home?
Oh Brother I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh Sister I will help you out!
Ooooh if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey Brother, there's an endless road to re-discover
Hey Sister, do you still believe in love I wonder?
Ooooh if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Aaaaaah, What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother I will hear your call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister i will help out!
Oooh with the sky comes falling down, for
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go, watchin' you turn your back
Like you always do, face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never want to say but I've never
Had a doubt, it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go, watchin' you turn your back
Like you always do, face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
No, hear me out now, you're gonna listen to me
Like it or not, right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not, right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, it's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though oh, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
I just called (just called) to say (to say)how much I care, I do
I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, baby of my heart
Hey, hey
I bet it must be nice chilling every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm working all the time, never getting me a break
Fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I got to be going in
A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels
Cause haters be looking stupid when you just keepin it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
When the people coming up sayin I'm forgetting who I am just because they
Random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs I'm trynna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything will be okay

Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?
One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found out being famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'mma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick

Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay

Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
Don't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin like the 808
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
But everything will be all right!
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright
Chorus:
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet n' wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees

The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Ooh oh ooh

I just remembered that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to

Our love was comfortable and so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say "she's gonna be good for you"
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
So they say, hey

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
No, I want you back, baby
No, no, no, I want you back, tonight, babe

That you were my first love, is just dumb luck
A technicality
You were ahead of me
That you were my first love, was just dumb, dumb, stupid luck
A technicality
You will always be ahead of me
Why'd I have to practice on you?
Why'd I have to practice on your heart?
When everybody leaves you lonely, times are worse than sad
And the world is falling on your head
Just remember for all you know, good or bad come what may
You're gonna live tomorrow, if you don't die today

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah-eah-eah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

Now the fear got in me, it's cuttin' me deep
That's where it's gonna stay and never leave
Someone come lay my worry, someone come kill my pain
Someone come and put me on my feet again, yeah-yeah-yeah

It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah-eah-eah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

We gotta love one another, that's what the good man say
But I got too much trouble going round my head
Someone come and pick up my love, take it all away
'Cause I could break down tomorrow if I don't die today
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah-eah-eah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

Ey
Ey
Ey
Ey
(Woah-oah-ah-oh, ey.)
You miss me?
I miss all of y'all, hey
All of you girls standin' together like that, I can't take it

None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it just like me

I can do anything you need
I can give you dirty looks
Like them niggas that's on TV

None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it just like me

And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

When that sugar's callin' you

Girl, this is show time
This is where you wanna be

Satisfaction guaranteed

Old man down, way down, down
Down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime
A dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best
More than my wine, more than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said I'd come to no good, I knew I would pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doin' time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling 'round drunk on Burgundy wine
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good old Lord willin', if He says I may
I know that the life I'm livin's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should
I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dyin' day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"
I got up and wandered, wandered downtown
Nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time, one time, one time

When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gonna keep, keep climbin' till the mountain top!

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And my heart (I got my)

You're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)

Always makin' time for you
Imma tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)
Imma tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)

You look so deep, You know that it humbles me
You by my side and troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want, shorty, I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (I got my)

Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying in here by your side
Wished I was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing

If we could spend forever
Be apart never
That's alright, with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

Don't wanna let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wished I was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Be apart never
That's alright, with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing
This is a call to the colorblind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind the horizon line
Tied up in something true

Yes I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Why is it not my time?
What is there more to learn?
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return
Yes I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
Yes I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now
(Doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Ah, ah

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
About sound and vision?
About sound and vision?
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight

I'm a poorman's son from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye

When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight, because my heart is true

She says baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight

She's a pearl of a girl
I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks she was born and raised
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I
And I know I'm just an average guy
No footfall hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets you see, I'm a poor man's son

Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what if I can't do
Out of sight, because my heart is true

She says baby everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight

Baby everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, way out of sight
And I don't know where you went, when you left me but
Says here in the water, you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
Where you say it's alright
You got your heart right
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on the porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
"All you need is love" is a lie 'cause
We had love, but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left
So maybe Ill sleep inside my coat and wait on the porch
'til you come back home Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
I called because I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over, but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away
'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right)
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right)
(Two wrongs make it all alright tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right)
"We'd like to say, we'd like you to clap your hands just one more time, and sing along with us"

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
And I know I may end up failing too
But I know You were just like me
With someone disappointed in you
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Tired of being what you want me to be
It's really over
You made your stand
You got me crying
As was your plan
But when my loneliness is through
I'm gonna find another you

You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm gonna sing my way away from blue
I'm gonna find another you

When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
And she's nicer, too

So go on, baby
Make your little getaway
My pride will keep me company
And just gave yours all away
Now I'm gonna dress myself for two
Once for me, and once for someone new
I'm gonna do some things you wouldn't let me do
I'm gonna find another you
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years
Bye bye

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years
Bye bye

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years
Bye bye

She's leaving home
Bye bye

[Verse 1]
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out, now

[Chorus]
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 2]
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now

[Chorus]
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now

[Chorus]
She was a day tripper
A Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Outro]
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper

[Verse]
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
First you gotta pass
And I ain't ready for that
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But no one wants to die

[Verse]
'Cause everybody wants to go to Heaven
First you gotta pass
Are you ready for that?
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But no one wants to die

[Outro]
What if Heaven's right here?
What if Heaven's right here?

[Intrumental Outro]
Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest storyline
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
C'mon back to bed
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
98 and 6 degrees of separation from you, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love
Life is so strange with it's changing yes indeed
Well I've seen hard times and the pressure's been on me
But I keep on working like a working man do
And I got my act together I'm gonna walk all over you

Gimme back my bullets, put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around 'cause I've done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done, gimme back my bullets

Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues

Gimme back my bullets, put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around 'cause I've done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done, gimme back,gimme back my bullets
Oh put 'em back........where they belong

Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well I've been on top then it seems I lost my dream
But I've got it back I'm feeling better every day
Tell all those pencil pushers they better get out of my way
Gimme back my bullets, put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around 'cause I've done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done, gimme back,gimme back my bullets
Ooh put back where they belong
Gimme back my bullets

[Intro]
OW!
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
Ooh, my honey
You got me workin' day and night
Ooh, my sugar
You got me workin' day and night
Scratch my shoulder
It's aching, make it feel alright
When this is over
Lovin' you will be so right

[Pre-Chorus]
(That's why)
You got me workin' day and night
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

[Chorus]
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night

[Verse 2]
How can you live girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be (well, ah)
Then you must be seein'
Some other guy instead of me (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
(That's why)
You got me workin' day and night
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

[Chorus]
You got me workin' workin' day and night (Hold on)

And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

[Chorus]
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Yeah)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(I'm so tired tired now)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Take it over)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Aoow)
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Lying in my bed
I hear a clock ticking and I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashbacks, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase memories

Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling out to me
And I can't hear what you say
You say go slow
Now I'm far behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time affter time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my pictures fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drumbeats out of time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

You say go slow
Now I'm far behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

[Intro]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
You'll find you get what you need

[Verse 1]
Well, I saw him today at the reception
Standing there with a glass in his hand
I knew he would go meet his connection
His cancels that all turn and sing

[Chorus]
Said you can't always get what you want
No, you can't always get what you want
Said you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime, you just might find
You get what you need
Ooh hoo, hee, you get what you need, yeah

[Verse 2]
He dressed up, go to the demonstrations
To get his fair share of abuse
He wanted to be an overnight sensation
And if he don't, he's gonna blow a 50-amp fuse, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want, oh yeah
You can't always get what you want, no no
You know you can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You get what you need, get what you need

[Verse 3]
He goes to the drugstore near the station
Some say to get his prescriptions filled
He's practiced at the art of deception
No one can tell what he really feels, yeah yeah yeah

I was standin' in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided to have a soda
"Whatcha favorite flavor?", "Cherry red"
And I sung my song to my friend Jimmy
And he said one word back to me, that was "Dead"
I said

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want, ow ow ow
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, say you just might find
You get what you need, get what you need, oh yeah

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You try sometime, just might find
You get what you need

[Bridge]
(Overnight sensation) Overnight sensation
(Education) Education
(There's no relation)
(Need a vacation) I need a vacation
(And we need elation) And we need elation
(With some cooperation)
(And we need the patience, hoo)

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want

[Outro]
It's a feeling, off the ceiling
Gon' get on down now, to the real nitty gritty, yeah
That bass is pumpin'
But you can't get it, you can't get it now
(You can't always get what you want)
You know that you can't always get what you want, what you want, what you want
(You can't always get what you want)
Girl, you, you can't always get what you want, oh yeah, no no
(You can't always get what you want)
But do you know, second-best will stand a chance, yes it is, oh, yes it will

As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hoo (Ahh), hoo hoo

[Janet Jackson]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but

I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, both]
With such confusions
Don't it make you wanna scream

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, both]
With such collusions
Don't it make you wanna scream

(Little Susie's sample)
There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

Upon the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
Upon the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ohh...
Ooh...
Ohh...
See heaven's got a plan for you

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ohh...
Ooh...
Ohh...
Yeah!
Have you heard about my baby (3 times)

Well, I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Waitin' for the train, yeah
Take me home, yeah
From this lonesome place
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes
My girl had called me a disgrace
Dig
The tears burnin'
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me
Way down in my heart
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl
It's too bad

I hear my train a comin' (3 times)

Too bad we have to part (have to part)
Dig
Gonna leave this town, yeah
Gonna leave this town
Gonna make a whole lotta money
Gonna be big, yeah
Gonna be big, yeah
I'm gonna buy this town
I'm gonna buy this town
An' put it all in my shoe
Might even give a piece to you
That's what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I heard some say better run away
Others say better stand still
I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead
Who can deny, who can deny
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Now, I don't know, but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold
Keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late
You can overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
I don't know, but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
Well I'm talking 'bout a hometown
A little party back in the pines
I'm really thinkin' 'bout your house
And your couch, and getting some
On a Saturday night

When I'm singing 'bout
Whiskey, summer, spring break, lovers
Shirt hanging off a tree
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Brown skin, blue eyes, pink toes, red sky
You hanging onto me

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah
Well I say a little hey baby (hey baby)
What's your number and where you from
I'm really thinking about you baby
And the first crazy night I got to get you home

After the drive-in, the kissing
The leaving, the missing
You're everywhere I go

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah

When I'm singing 'bout
Whiskey, summer, spring break, lovers
Shirt hanging off a tree
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Brown skin, blue eyes, pink toes, red sky
You hanging onto me
After the drive-in, the kissing
The leaving, the missing
You're everywhere I go

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah

You know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah
You're the girl on the radio
Step into the velvet of the morning
Let yourself lay back within your dreams
Take on the situation but not the torment
Now you know it's not as bad as it seems

Well, I know you'd like to come away
But, baby, you can't come
Fortune is your life's love

Oh, and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go

And the heart says danger
And the heart says whatever
It is that you want from me
I am just one small part of
Forever falling star, star catcher

Even when you feel like your life is fading
I know that you'll go on forever, you're that good
Heartbreak of the moment is not endless
Fortune is your life's love

Well, honey I know you'd like to come away
But, baby, you can't come
Fortune is your life's love

Oh, and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go

And the heart says danger
And the heart says whatever
Think about it before you go

Think about it before you go
When I look back
Boy, I must have been green
Boppin' in the country
Fishin' in a stream

Lookin' for an answer
Tryin' to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights
Honey, I was blind

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
Oh, from a bottle of wine
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies
Down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home
Well, they said I was a fool
They said, oh, believe in the Lord
Is the golden rule

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good

They said stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Livin' in the city, boy
Is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no?
How can you stop when your feet say go?

You better get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, the change is gonna do me good
You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
Oh, from a bottle of wine

Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat
Get back, woo

Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat
Get back, woo
Though the times are getting wicked I'm older
I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintaining, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an artist see
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far will we let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try and stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next accounted by the press
Mad stress on my chest
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On "Any Given Sunday" I got to play my best

[Chorus]
Sacrifice don't give up the fight
Everything will be all right on any given Sunday
The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose
You know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Strive to achieve and die for what you believe

On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded
No defensive they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt

[Chorus]
Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles are like the yardlines that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame can be as painful as
Death of patron
Young black, gifted
But I'm rapped in myself
Broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars fell
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
As long as we play well they love us
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money
I know that on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
But it all comes down to is money why'all

[Chorus x2]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged, get back Jojo
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged, oh, get back Jo
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta, Loretta
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta
Your mama is waiting for you
In her high heel shoes
And her low neck sweater
Get back Loretta, get back little girl
Yeah, now get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
The rnornent I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
Oh while combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and forever we never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together together that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus dear
While riding I think of us dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee-break time
I say a little prayer for you
Forever forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and forever we never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together together that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you

Forever forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and forever we never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together together that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

My darling believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer
Say you love me too
Why don't you answer my prayer? yeah
You know every day
I say a little prayer
I said I say I say a little prayer
Why don't you answer my prayer?
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Here I am
I'm your Brooklyn baby
With a premonition
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing

Evil comes ah-flying
Flying so, so low
Sky is turning poison
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Helicopters are coming
Helicopters are coming
To take me far away
Two-fingered Gypsy king
Has a golden, wounded knee
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
About the blue light squadron
About the blue light squadron
Here as a witness
I never had a chance
Cartoon creeps are playing
Playing dirty games
Sending me to home
In a one way ticket bodysack
Just like Jimmy always said
An unknown hero
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou

[Verse 1]
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I, bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

[Chorus 1]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away

[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Can make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[Chorus 1]
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Bridge]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

[Chorus 2]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
Ask for money, and get it viced
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice
Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)

Mr Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita, come on, dale

(I wanna feel this moment)

(Feel this moment...)
Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from the hard ways
Bill sos, and oh yeas
They count it always, 305 all day
Now baby we can party, oh baby we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tight ups
I got it hooked
Cause she seen me in a suit with the red ta-ta up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money
Only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)

(Feel this moment...)

I see the future but live for the moment, make sense don't
It
Now make dollars, I mean billions, im a genius, I mean
Brilliant
This street is what scoot em
And made em slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But i'm still undefeated like Zula
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with alll my
Peeps
Baby we can travel the world
And not given view, and all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it, like a stop watch
Let's stop time and enjoy this moment
Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Come one, feel this moment...

Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
If you should ever feel alone
You know you can call on me, call on me
When you've lost the will to carry on
You know you can't count on me, count on me to...
Catch you when you fall down
Never leave you standing out in the cold
When your heart aches
When you need a safe place
I want you to know
You should know...
When you wanna run away
You can always come, you can come to me
When you wanna run away
You can always run
You can always run to me, me, me
You can always run to me, me, me
When you wanna run away
You can always run to me
It doesn't matter where you are
I'll come if you call on, call on me
Cause even when we're far apart
You know you can count on me, count on me to...
Catch you when you fall down
Never leave you standing out in the cold
When your heart aches
When you need a safe place
I want you to know
You should know...
When you wanna run away
You can always come, you can come to me
When you wanna run away
You can always run
You can always run to me, me, me
You can always run to me, me, me
When you wanna run away
You can always run to me
Run, run, run, run...

That I love to make love to you, baby?
So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
If this would be a perfect world

[Chorus]
I wanna dance, and love
And dance again

And dance again

Baby, your fire is lighting me up

Your lips taste like heaven, so why should I stop?
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
If this would be a perfect world

Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

[Drop]

[Verse]
I feel so close to you right now

[Spoken AUDITIONER WOMAN]
Can I just ask you, Billy
What does it feel like when you're dancing?

[BILLY]
I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free
It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
But the music is impossible, impossible to hear
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

Electricity, sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
I'm free. Free I'm free
Yeah, sing the song, bro

If the sun refuse to shine
I don't mind
I don't mind
If the mountains fell in the sea
Let it be
It ain't me

'Cause I got my own world to look through
And I ain't gonna copy you

Now if six turned out to be nine
I don't mind
I don't mind
If all the hippies cut off all their hair
I don't care
I don't care, dig

'Cause I got my own world to live through
And I ain't gonna copy you
White collared conservative flashing down the street
Pointing their plastic finger at me, huh
They're hoping soon, my kind will drop and die
But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high, high, oh!

Wave on, wave on

Fall mountains, just don't fall on me
Go ahead on, Mr. Businessman, you can't dress like me

...I got my own life to live
I'm the one that's going to die when it's time for me to die
So let me live my life
The way I want to
There
Sing on, brother
Play on, drummer
Water gray
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground, now I, now I do
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another, and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room

I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
(Such a lovely day)
Everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I got to cry, 'cause crying
Eases the pain, oh yeah

People, this hurt I feel inside
Words, they, could never explain
I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, baby
Let it rain (rain, rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain

Day in day out, my tear-stained face
Pressed against my window pane
My eyes search the skies, desperately for rain
'Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm crying (crying) crying (crying)
When I go outside

To the world outside
My tears I refuse to explain
Ooh, I wish it would rain
(How I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, baby

Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise
The tears in my eyes

Oh, let it rain
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen
I'm a man and I've got my pride
'Til it rains I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain

[Verse 1]
Jimmy was your sweetie pie
Your precious one
And I knew you used to love
The very ground he walked upon
One day, Jim's papa told him
Things were looking down
And they packed up everything
They owned and left this little old town
Each tear I dried for you
The closer our lives grew
I fell in love it's true
And you say you love me, too

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Ooh, baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby
But, baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?

[Verse 2]
The day you see his face again
Or hear his voice
I don't want to be a loser
If you have to make a choice
Like a puppet to a string
To you, girl, I'm attached
And I know I'd be in trouble
If he came and took you back
I feel so insecure
In my mind, I can picture
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure

[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Sure enough, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved Jim?
Ooh Baby

[Verse 3]
I can't stop loving you, baby
I can't stop loving you , no
I can't stop loving you, baby
I feel so insecure
In my mind, I
Can picture
Losing you for sure
And the pain I can't endure
Baby, I'm worried
Really, really worried
I wanna make you happy
Really truly happy

[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering
How can I make you love me
A little more than you loved him?
Oh baby I'm wondering
Little girl, I'm wondering ...
"Ha Ha Ha", says Mama Bear as she irons Daddy's holey underwear
And "Hee Hee Hee", says Daddy bear as Junior pours honey all on sister hair
Anyway you know they live happily ever after
Well, "Ho ho ho" say the little fish
As the sad fisherman goes home without a hitch
But "Hee hee hee" says the fisherman
With his lady burning french fries in the frying pan
(This is so silly man)
"Hee hee hee" says you to me
(Man I don't feel like going through with this, this is really silly)
Oh man, I wanna die
'cause walking around on the ground is really cramping my high
I sure don't wanna live without you forever after, no
Now what does all this have to do with the three little bears?
Well, I was just feeling blue, 'cause I really care
That you're still gone from me and I'm as sad as I can be
So I'll sing and play this tune until you come back home to me

[Verse 1]
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body?
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly?
And can you kneel before the king
And say, "I'm clean, I'm clean"?

[Chorus]
Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention but denied my affections, my affections
So tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

[Instrumental Break]

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Bridge]
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Oh, lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no

Hammerin'
Talkin' 'bout heart 'n' s-soul
I'm talkin' about hard stuff
If everybody's still around, fluff and ease, if
So far out my mind
Something's happening, something's happening
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh, yeah!

Purple haze all in my eyes, uhh
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?

Ooh
Help me
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze, yeah
Oh, no, oh
Oh, help me
Tell me, baby, tell me
I can't go on like this
You're makin' me blow my mind, mama
N-no, nooo
No, it's painful, baby

[Verse 1]
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

[Chorus 1]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus 2]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion, yeah
I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone

[Verse 1]
Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
And look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You never have needed anyone for so long

[Verse 2]
You learn in your bed
You've been gone for too long
So you put in the time
But it's too late to make it strong

[Chorus]
Now all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Now all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity

Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never have needed anything for so long

[Chorus]
And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

[Verse 4]
From now on, I'm someone different
'Cause it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
'Cause I just want what I want

[Outro]
Take me home
Take me home

Uhh.. UH! .. WHOO!

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, 9-1-1 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Another day's been laid to waste

Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating!
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me!

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow somewhere
And no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up...
I'm sick of Feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating!
Tell me what the fuck is
Wrong with me!

Wrong with me!
You act like you don't want to listen
When I'm talking to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you wanna do
You must be crazy baby
You just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

I'll drink if I want to
And play a little poker too
Don't you say nothing to me
As long as I'm taking care of you
As long as I'm workin baby
And payin' all the bills
I don't want no mouth from you
About the way I'm supposed to live
You must be crazy woman
Just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I foot the bills
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss
Now that you got me
You act like you ashamed
You don't act like my woman
You just usin' my name
I tell you I'm gonna have all the money
And I don't want no back-talk
Cause if you don't like the way I'm doin'
Just pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy baby
You must be outta your mind
As long as I'm payin' the bills woman
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place

Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Ooh
Hey man

[Verse 1 : Jordan Rakei]
Street light, light into my life tonight
Hold the peace sign, over till I'm feeling right
This world, this world, light into my life tonight
This girl, this girl, over till I'm feeling right
Street light, light into my life tonight
Hold the peace sign, over till I'm feeling right
This world, this world, light into my life tonight
This girl, this girl, over till I'm feeling right

[Verse 2 : Jordan Rakei]
And I found her at the corner store, she says she'll come around
And she told me it's been done before, profound (profound)
She was food for the soul (food for the soul)
Future nubian queen, you moan, yeah
The sun is shining at my door, she said let's hang around
Her deep brown eyes say I'm sure, I'm more, I'm more, I'm more
She was food for the soul (food for the soul)
Cause I'm lost in the dream, no control

[Verse 3 : Gwen Bunn]
I don't know if this is right to say
But I remember when my nights were grey
Because of you, I can see the light of day (day)
And I swear I knew it right away (oh right away)
Hope the night skies light up in my life tonight
Let the moment shine right into you and my life

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
When I woke up this morning
All I could think about was you
Cause when I went to sleep last night
All I could think about was you
Adam and Eve don't eat that fruit
'Best believe I'mma eat that Boo
Cause I'm the nigga that told them niggas
That told them niggas, 'Bout you
Chuck the duce, while I'm ridin' through
Tityboi I might sign a boob
Your nigga hatin', tell your nigga that's hatin'
That if he gettin some paper I might sign him too
'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through
I can see you niggas from a side view
I'm in and out the pussy, drive through
White coupe, with the white rims
I like to crank the top and let the light in
You know she dark skin her friend light skin
Put us together, and it's Ice cream
Sandwiches she can't manage it
I know her man Is sick, she can't handle it
She need some time alone I told her call my phone
And when she call my phone I didn't answer it

[Hook]
K.o
I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more
Roll till your bitches can't roll no more
K.o
I'm gonna blow till you niggas can't blow no more
Blow till your bitches can't blow no more
K.o

[Interlude]
I was in Detroit, Michigan after going to go visiting with some friends of mine

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
B-I-G
Okay I'm in motion, I'm rollin' and smoking
And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion
I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion
Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion
I'm burnin' bread toasin' and joking
Cause I went from views of my moms house to views of the ocean
Niggas talk shit, But that's free promotion
I'm living my life like the end is approaching
Man fuck these niggas with a passion
I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket
My Grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter
Till I bought her ass a house bigger than the Pastor's, Hallelujah
Your now fucking with a bad bitch connoisseur
My ex-girl said man the fame caught up to ya
Baby you don't still think about me, wet dream about me
I swear you use to couldn't wait to k.o
Blow till your bitches can't blow no more

[Intro: Ving Rhames]
He's a hustler, unbound by law
A self-made, millionaire
With a wreckless disregard, for the haters
Ludacris, on "Southern Gangsta"...
A true, entrepre-negro
CEO of Disturbing The Peace Records
He expended his empire into multiple profitable businesses
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits
The MVP, of this rap shit

[Ludacris]
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer
I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)
Spit 30 large for cigars of you hoe niggas (oww!)
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you, into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the "Port of Miami"
To keepin it "True"
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
He's worth eight figures
So young niggas, boss up
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss

[Rick Ross]
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said "We want hustlers"
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillows
Frontin at awards, real street niggas
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass
Big ass face, chop you in your laugh face
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
Hailing from College Park, Georgia
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob
Or illegal organization
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week
Selling {?}, they were some high-rollin hustlers
Tity Boi, and Dolla Boy
Playaz Circle, A.K.A., the Duffle Bag Boys

[Tity Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support strippers
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)
(White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow)
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late
Ain't no such thing as second place
(And every day I live heavyweight, you niggas featherweight)

(Fairytale tellin niggas really need to take a break)
And the estate got a lake for a backyard
(The pool room product put it all on my sacks card)
For real? (Yeah, for real)
I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will
(I got dogs like Cujo, me and Tity two chains ridin in a two do')
Bitches catch kudos (you know)
Yeah we move weight like sumos
And kicks it with them bitches like judo
SOUTHSIDE!

Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep little lion man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
Wasted on fixing all the problems that you made in your own head
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?
Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble little lion man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?
Every day in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey!

You can't hold me down

Stone free to ride the breeze

'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way
Now what would it take to break
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

'Cause everybody

Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things

And your footsteps are down the hall

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight."

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go Go
Johnny Go
Oh Go go
Johnny Go
Oh Go Go
Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode
(Wait a minute, man. Hey, check this out, tell it. It was this blind man, right?
Man, check this out- it was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick, right?
Hey. He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'?
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said
Woooooo, good morning, ladies hahahaha
You like that shit, man? Hey, man, I got a gang of that shit, man
I tell you what- my man on the guitar, Hey, fool on the drums
Everybody just crowd around the mic, I'll tell you all these mutha-fuckin' jokes
But first, I'ma start it off like this. Hey, help me sing it, homeboy.)

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville
If my tapes and my cd's just don't sell, I bet my caddy will

Well it was just sundown in a small white town. They call it Eastside Palmdale
When the Afroman walked through the white land, houses went up for sale
Well, I was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cd's when I met a little girl named Jan
I let her ride in my Caddy cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan
We fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right. She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a ZEBRA!
I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way, until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet
I ran. I jumped out the back window, but her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4
Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy I ever had
I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine. I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time
Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville
If my tapes and my cd's just don't sell, I bet my caddy will

I met this lady in Hollywood. She had green hair, but damn she looked good
I took her to my house, cause she was fine, but she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice. I ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya. I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties, too, so I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo
See, I met this woman from Hawaii. Stuck it in her ass, and she said, Aiiiiieeee!
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch, then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky. She said, I'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me
I came in her mouth. It was a crisis. I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
Hey, wait a minute man, check this out
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee. Her titties were filled with Hennesy
That country music nearly drove me crazy, but I rode that ass and said, Yes, Miss Daisy!
Met this lady in Oklahoma; put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan; I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl in South Carolina; fucked her 'til she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa. I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
Fucked this girl, down in Georgia; came in her mouth. Man, I thought I told ya
Met this beautiful sexy ho; she just ran cross the border of Mexico
Fine young thing, said her name's Maria. I wrapped her up just like a Hot Tortilla
I wanna get married, but I can't afford it. I know I'ma cry when she gets deported

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong

Have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck, but the pussy just ain't no good? (SAY WHAT?)
And then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet, plus you in the wrong neighborhood?
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy, but it takes her so long to come (SAY WHAT?)
Then a dude walks in. That's her big boyfriend, and he asks you where you from? (Where you from, man?)
So you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (I don't bang.), you start talkin' real fast
But he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife, so he starts beatin' on your ass
Now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody, your dick was hard but now it's soft. (WHUT?)
You thought you had a girl to rock your world, now you still gotta go jack off

Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
(fade out)
I'm not alone, I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now, they do right now
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is at all
When Autumn comes, it doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is at all
I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over the counter test
For loneliness, for loneliness like this
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is
Something's different and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is
Friends, check
Money, check
Well-slept, check
Opposite sex, check
Guitar, check
Microphone, check
Messages waiting on me
When I come home, check
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need

[Verse 1]
That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

[Verse 2]
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

[Verse 3]
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in

And when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

Oh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten fucking who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing 85 days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this

And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over "Hey, I'm finally dead."

Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you knew you were tired
But then where are your friends tonight?

[Chorus]
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
Just cast away and I am lost at sea
Another lonely day and no one here but me
More loneliness than any man could bare
Rescue me before I fall into despair
I send an SOS to the world
I send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle hey
A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known it right from the start
Only hope can keep us together
Love can mend your life but love can break your heart
I send an SOS to the world
I send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle, hey
Message in a bottle, bottle
Walked out this morning, I don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore
It seems I'm not alone at being alone
A hundred million castaways, all looking for a home
I send an SOS to the world
I send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, hey
Uhh.. UH! .. WHOO!

Lately things they don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

Well I took my Ruby jukin'
On the out-skirts of town
She took her high heels off
And rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox
To get a little beat
Everybody started watchin'
All the rhythm in her feet

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

Now Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
And when she started rockin'
She just couldn't stop
She rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor
And Everybody yelled: "Ruby rock some more!"
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

It was 'round about four
I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then
She looked at the clock
She said: "Wait a minute Daddy
Now don't get sour
All I want to do
Is rock a little bit more"

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

One night my Ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said: "Leave me alone Daddy
'cause your Ruby wants to rock"

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a-rockin'
Boy it satisfies my soul

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Sure enough, this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel, she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man
You're gonna rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discoverin' you, oh
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue, uh uh uh
And if you want love
(Then make it)
Swim in a deep sea
(Of blankets)
Take all your big plans

(And break 'em)
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way
The hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take
When crawlin' towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love? We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
Take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Damn baby, you frustrate me
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good, it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland, oh no

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels
And me, my little red Corvette has driven by
Fair weather heart is falling in
My rainy day girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning 'round

[Chorus]
I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you
Yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hi, can I walk you home again today
Got to get forgive and forget hey, hey
Something good is happening and I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only because you're true
Someone out-timed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in

[Chorus]
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you, yes they were
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you, ooh
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you

[Outro]
It doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter where you try to go
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter who we really are
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Really doesn't matter, not you
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter

[Verse 1]
You hold your truth so purely
Swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the Devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

[Chorus]
But fingers tap into what you were once
Now I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark
I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad but I'm not a fraud
I'd set out to serve the Lord
But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I love
Under the sun!
Under the sun!

[Chorus]
But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
Fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Outro]
But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head
Let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young

If I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go
Longin' to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you, ooh

[Chorus]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets, yes I will
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Verse 2]
I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Ooh, ooh baby, if there's anything that you fear, anything
Just call my number, baby baby, and I'll be here, here

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep your secrets, yes I will
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Bridge]
Yeah, uh-huh, oh oh oh
'Cause only we know what we talked about, baby boy
Don't know how you can be drivin' me so crazy, boy
Baby, when you're in town why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me, boy, oh

[Chorus]
I won't tell your secrets (I won't tell nobody)
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)

I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly
And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Said, "I ain't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class"
Tellin' ya I'm just a fellow
Said, "I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time"
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no, no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell ya
I've got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Too busy thinking about my baby
Ain't got time for nothing else, no, no, no
Too busy thinking about my baby
Ain't got time for nothing else, no, no, no
Too busy thinking about my baby

Shut up and play the hits!
Ladies and gentlemen, for our live record called Shut Up and Play the Hits

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no
We’ve been on planes and on trains 'til we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh
I hate the feelin' when you're lookin' at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
'Cause we're North American
But in the end, make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America

[Verse 2]
And all the kids, all the kids don’t wanna make a scene
Here in North America
When all your kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love? Where's the love? Where's the love?
Where's the love? Where's the love, tonight?
But there's no love, man, there's no love when the kids are uptight
Uh, uh
So throw a party ‘til the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it? I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said, "The more I do it, the better it gets"
Come on, North America

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are North American

[Verse 3]
New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh
Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Ooh, ooh
Now, we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh
You see, I love this place that I have grown to know
Come on,, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are from North American
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are from North America

[Outro]
(Ah-ah) Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
(Ah-ah) Where we can be in any one of a million new bands
North America
(Ah-ah) Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
(Ah-ah) But don't blame the Canadians
Look out, North America
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
Or whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lie in my bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I"am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on?
When I say, hey yeah yeah hey hey yeah yay
I say hey, what's going on?
When I say, hey yeah yeah hey hey yeah yay
Yah yah yah hiya
I say hey, what's going on?
Ooh, ooh ooh
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change
My mind
Goodbye
Yeah, I'm losing my edge
And I'm losing my edge
The kids are coming up from behind
Yeah, I'm losing my edge
And I'm losing my edge
To the kids from France and from London
But I was there, I was there in 1968
I was there at the first Can shows in Cologne
Yeah I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge
I can hear their footsteps when they get on the decks
Yeah, I'm losing my edge
To the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1964 to 1978

I'm losing my edge
To the art-school Brooklynites in tiny jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties
(If you're not having fun, you suck)

But I'm losing my edge, I'm losing my edge
But I was there
I was there but I was there
Yeah, I'm losing my edge, Yeah, I'm losing my edge
To the kids footsteps I hear, when they get on the deck
But I was there, I was there in 1974
At the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band
I told him, "Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime."

I was there, I was the first guy playing Daft Punk
To the rock kids
I played it at CBGB's, everybody thought I was crazy
We all know it know
I was there
I've never been wrong
I used to work in the record store
I had everything before anyone
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988
(I, I was doing drugs)

But I'm losing my edge
To better-looking people with better ideas and more talent, you know
Seriously, they have a really good web plan, and some
SHA! (repeated)
I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody
Every great song by The Peech Boys
All the underground hits
All the Modern Lovers tracks
I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87
I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagara record on German import
I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s

I hear you're buying a sequencer and an arpeggiator, that's the best move, and throwing your computer out the window
Why?
'Cause you like to make something real
What would you like to make?
You'd like to make a Yaz record
I hear that you and your friends
I hear that you and your friends
I hear that you and your friends have sold your guitars and bought turntables
I hear that you and your friends have sold your turntables and bought guitars
I hear that everyone that you know is more relevant than my favorite fuckers, I know

But have you seen my records? This Heat, Pere Ubu, Outsiders, Nation of Ulysses, Mars, The Trojans, The Black Dice, Todd Terry, The Germs, Section 25, Althea and Donna, Sexual Harrassment, a-ha, Pere Ubu, Dorothy Ashby, PIL, the Fania All-Stars, the Bar-Kays, The Human League, the Normal, Lou Reed, Scott Walker, Monks, Niagra, Joy Division, Lower 48, The Association, Sun Ra, Scientists, Royal Trux, 10cc, Eric B. and Rakim, Index, Basic Channel, Soulsonic Force ("just hit me"!), Juan Atkins, David Axelrod, Electric Prunes, Gil!

You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want
You don't know what you really want (Okay, stop)
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon, there is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred

Our preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An' all the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on all around you
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize and say, "God bless him"
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scuff at pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, "Okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?"

And if my thought dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only
Back up train
(Back up train)
Turn it around
(Turn around)
I've got to take my baby
(Got to take my baby)
Ohh, wherever I'm bound
I'm
(Roaming through this lane)
Everyday, baby
(Roaming through this lane)
Ohh
I'm a lonely man
Just a lonely man
Need a helping hand
Yeah, yea, yea
Back up train
(Back up train)
But ease the pain
(Ease the pain)
Take me to my baby
(Take me to my baby)
Oh, I'm going insane
So, Mister conductor
(Turn this train around)
All you gotta do now
(Turn this train around)
Ohh
Music in my hand
I'm a lonely man
Need a helping hand
Yeah, yeah
So back this train up
It's all you gotta do now, now
I'll never forget the girl, I left behind
(Back up train)
Her tears, her kiss, her face stay on my mind
I got to make her say that she'll forgive me
I gotta get back, so, ohh
Baby, baby, baby, baby
(Back up train)
I need, I need your loving right now, darling
Oh
(Back up train)
Oh, I need my baby
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real, oh

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting)
Reacting
Against my will I'll stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting)
How I can't seem
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface)
(Consuming)
Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending)
(Controlling)
Confusing what is real
Yea, everything's right on time right now
How ya doing?
You feeling alright?
Yeah, alright, there you go
We have Billy Cox on bass
Mitch Mitchell on drums
And yours truly on the public saxophone, thank you
Give us about a minute to get tuned up and
Get rid of these joints and everything, alright
We're gonna start up on a little jam, you know just
Everything is like relaxed
Forget about yesterday or tomorrow whatever you say
This is our own little world here tonight
We'll just go in this groove a little bit
We'll just do a little instrument tune
And check our tuning, alright
So lay back and
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me, how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on
My back

I keep on fallin'
In and I love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, at times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin' makes me so confused
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure and cause me so much pain?
Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
Songwriters
AUGELLO-COOK, ALICIA J
I am driving up 85 in the kind of morning
That lasts all afternoon, I'm just stuck inside the gloom
Four more exits to my apartment
But I am tempted to keep the car in drive and leave it all behind
'Cause I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdict less life
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Am I living it right
Why, why Georgia, why?
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with wood in places
To make it feel like home but all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis, just a stirrin' in my soul
Either way I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdict less life
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?
So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me, don't believe me when I say I've got it down
Everybody's just a stranger but that's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's a price I have to pay, still everything happens for a reason
Is no reason not to ask myself if I'm living it right
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Why tell me, why
Why, why Georgia, why?
"Here he comes"
"Here he comes take one"

Here he comes, I say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Aah I gotta get my head from this pillow
I gotta get outta your
No heart fellin's
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
I gotta get outta here and I got no time to lose
Hey
Here he comes
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I gotta get my suitcase
And get the hell outta just as fast as I can
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Doo doo....
She says she likes my watch, but she wants Steve’s AP
And she stay up all hours watching QVC
And so I put her number in my Bold BB

I got a black BM, she got a white TT
She wanna see what’s hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her wear suspenders and some PVC
And then I’ll film it all up on my JVC

Uh, scene one. Everybody get in your positions
Pay attention, and listen
We’re tryna get this in one take
So let's try and make that happen

A diva and her dealer
Bitch I’m up on the guest list
With the Swedish House Mafia
You can find me on a table
Full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies
And it ain't fucking Easter

I wake up in the morning
With a mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl
Like Lindsey Lohan, Queen Latifah

If you niggas are pullin'
Then boy I must be FIFA
And that’s standard procedure from Miami 2 Ibiza
Let your conscience be your guide
Let your conscience be your guide, oh baby

If you want to leave me, go on girl
Go on and leave, oh leave me

You know I've never, never, no, no, no, never done you wrong
I've always stuck right by your side, oh baby
You only had to call my name
Oh, oooh girl, if could feel the same

Ooh ooh ooh, hmm
Feel good to thank you this evening...
I'd feel better if we could say it just one more time, say
Thank you, Lord; thank you, Lord
Thank you, Lord
I got a notion to say what doesn't feel right
Got an answer in your story, today
It gave me a sign that didn't feel right, no

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before

I just wanted to know if I could go home
Been rambling in day after day
And everyone says I don't know

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before

Got a notion to say what doesn't feel right
I just wanted to know if I could go home

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before

So don't knock it, don't knock it
So don't knock it, don't knock it
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
If my words did glow
With the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played
On the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice
Come through the music?
Would you hold it near
As it were your own?
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
It's a hand-me-down
The thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall, you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home
The river whispers in my ear
I've hardly a penny to my name
The heavens never seemed so near
All of my body glows with flame

The tempest struggles in the air
And to myself alone I sing
It could sink me then and there
I can hear the echoes ring

I tried to find one smiling face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lying restless in a heavy bed

Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come from your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind

Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me, you'll understand
Emotions we can never share
You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now

I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gates

Beneath the thunder blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
The stars are cold, the night is young

The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floating by
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky

The evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The woods are dark, the town is too
They'll drag you down, they'll run the show
Ain't no telling what they'll do

Tell ol' Bill when he comes home
That anything is worth a try
Tell him that I'm not alone
And that the hour has come to do or die
All the world I would defy
Let me make it plain as day
I look at you now and I sigh
How could it be any other way?
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Ooooh...
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on
It gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night
She closed her eyes
In the night, the stormy night
Away she flied
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh
She dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh. (x2)
La, la, la...
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise"
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooooh...
Woah, ah mercy mercy me
Ah things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows
From the north and south and east

Woah mercy, mercy me, yeah yeah
Ah things ain't what they used to be
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury
Oh Jesus yeah mercy, mercy me ah
Ah things ain't what they used to be, oh no

Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying
Hey mercy, mercy me oh
Ah things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?

Oh, na na na
Ohh baby hey ooh
Five days
Underwater
Near your island
Off the coast
I know
Five ways
You were my lover
Incantations
Of the tide
In rhyme
Oh, out in the glow I'll find you waiting
Oh, has it been so long now, I
Oh, I thought you knew that I'd be coming
The way you move, a foreign groove, at night
I could never
I could never hold you
Watch it rise and where you hide your pearl
Feel the tide low where you cast those stones you wear
When no one's home, do they feel cold on your bones
All the years I've missed your warmth
Have you missed my warmth?
On your island
(Hook: Mystikal)
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

(Verse 1)
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than batman and robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling they business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
I know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep your chin up
'Cause sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up
(Hook)
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

(Verse 2)
No matter what happened that's only once it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then it's shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble we didn't want learn or
Sometimes we be getting in trouble we ain't gon' see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take 'em in stride and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody said fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happin'
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life will be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters
(Hook)
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

(Verse 3)
You heard about me, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you changed ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complainin' and forgot what you was cryin' bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And when it's over and done with I hope you proud of me
(Hook)
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

You keep bumping me against the wall (3x)
You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat and fade out)

[Verse 1]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free

[Pre-Chorus]
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul

[Verse 2]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show

[Pre-Chorus]
Har har, har har
Har har, har har

[Bridge]
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love, you invest your life
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love, you invest your life
(Hey!)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul

[Outro]
For you were made to meet your maker
Come on Denver!
Awake my soul, awake my soul
You were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker
Ah-ah
Do you know how to use this weapon?
- Not really. - That weapon will replace your tongue
You will learn to speak through it
And your poetry will now be written with blood
What is your name?
My name is Nobody
- Excuse me? - My name is Exaybachay:
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing
He Who Talks--
I thought you said your name was Nobody
I prefer to be called Nobody
Feels good ya know
Out of all the hotties in the world
I got everything I need in one girl
She the most amazing thing to me
And it ain't just what I see
It's the way that she love me
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Now I have many friends
That be going round
In and out a club thinkin'
Tryna find that special one, oh yes they do
But nothing's better than chemistry
And especially the kind between you and me
Makes me wanna shout out to the world
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Now, she means more than all of the world
I wouldn't trade her love for anything in this world
'Cause when we touchin' and we kissing
And ain't never nothing missing
And I love the way she love me
Be all on me if I diss it
She so amazing to me
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
'Cause when we touchin' and we kissing
And ain't never nothing missing
And I love the way she love me
Be all on me if I diss it
She so amazing to me
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
When you're with the dopest chick alive
(you could lose everything and still be my everything)

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Burning red, burning red

[Outro]
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
It's very far away
It takes about half a day
To get there, if we travel by my a.....dragonfly

No, it's not in Spain
But all the same
You know
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right

Hang on, my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's a really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic

The clouds are really low
And they overflow
With cotton candy
And battle grounds
Red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time
On bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there
I wanna make it right
I wanna make you cry

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and FLIP AROUND
Back lashing with a bullet FULL OF LOVE
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and FLIP AROUND
Back lashing with a bullet FULL OF LOVE
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and FLIP AROUND
Back lashing with a bullet FULL OF LOVE
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck
Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and FLIP AROUND
Back lashing with a bullet FULL OF LOVE
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

Stop swaying when the moon is shaking thou
Makes mama throw her hands and FLIP AROUND
Back lashing with a bullet FULL OF LOVE
Makes papa wanna crawl up his old truck

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow

I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
I follow soon, I follow soon
I follow soon, I follow
Midnight, lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This sunday night

Theres not a sound
Outside the snows comin' down
Somehow i can't seem to find
The quiet inside
My mind

3: 02
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears
Have cornered me here
Me and my t.v. screen

The volumes down
Blue lights are dancing around
And still
I can't seem to find the quiet
Inside my mind
Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start
Feet walk to halls
The world waits
And now I am safe
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day

[Verse 1]
I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked in your basement

[Verse 2]
I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth, I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

[Verse 3]
The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for beginning
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished

[Bridge]
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops

[Verse 4]
I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
You're smaller than my wife imagined
Surprised you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options?

[Chorus]
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone

[Outro]
You're safe for the moment
Saved for the moment
My baby she told me
She don't want to hold me
And kiss my lips anymore
She's gonna leave me
And she don't believe me
That I'll be true now
Well maybe she don't love me
And is not thinkin' of me
But why'd she do it this time of year?
She knows that I'll miss her
And I'll want to kiss her
If just for Christmas
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Tell me, what did I do
To really convince you
That I'm not the guy anymore
Take back my ring now
I'll do anything now
But please forgive me
I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh, why did we break up
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh, why did we break up?
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
I went to a party, was nothin' there but bobby socks
Went to a party, man you oughta seen ‘em to reel and rock
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I started rockin', man I threw my left foot out
I started swingin', somebody begin to shout
You got to Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
You got to Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low

The girls boys, they made so much noise
They even had a raid
But when the police got there all they could find
Was ice cream and lemonade

Oh what a party
I'm so glad I didn't stay at home
Oh what a party
They didn't treat me like I was a chaperone
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
The Women had they're heads laid on their fellas' shoulders
Who were boogie-woogeyin' and squeezin' em up in the room
I couldn't see how they was dancin
Cuz their feet, they didn't move

[Verse 1]
Weren't you the one that said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
To three o'clock in the morn'

[Verse 2]
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
And explaining to me, like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, wanna be a part of me
Now you, have so much to say to me
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you doin' to me?
You're confusing me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
To three o'clock in the morn'
Night after night knowing something's going on
What's that number for b go-a-go-a-gone

[Bridge]
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what your suppose to do
No need to punch me boo cause I won't play you cause

[Chorus]
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around (Yeah)
What goes up, most come down
Gotta stop trying to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
Back to you, it always comes around
Back to you, I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away, but it's too late

Over you, I'm never over
Over you, somethin' about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeah, I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away, not this way

Back to you, it always comes around
Back to you, I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed with your silhouette

Yeah, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you could not do
Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too, for me too, for me too, yeah

Back to me, you know that it comes
Back to me, doesn't it piss you off
Your will is not as strong, as it used to be
So I was lost
Go count the cost, before you go
To the Holland road with your heart like a stone
You spared no time in lashing out
And I knew your pain and the effect of my shame
But you cut me down, You cut me down

And I will not tell the thoughts of hell
That carried me home from the Holland road
With my heart like a stone I put up no fight
To your calloused mind and from your corner you rose
To cut me down, You cut me down

So I hit my low
Little did I know that would not be the end
From the Holland road well I rose and I rose
And I paid less time to your calloused mind
And I wished you well as you cut me down, you cut me down

But I still believe, though there's cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees, I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you'll believe in me, I'll still believe
But I still believe, though there's cracks you'll see
When I'm on my knees, I'll still believe
And when I've hit the ground, neither lost nor found
If you'll believe in me, I'll still believe
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all

All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over, over you
There's something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeah, I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way

Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette
Yeah, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah

Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooo-ooo, hoo-ooo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah

I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
Talkin' bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl

If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me baby, because I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man
Last fair deal in the country, sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby
Before you let my deal go down
Don't you push me baby, cause I'm moaning low
Well I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go
Everybody's breaking and drinking that wine
I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight
Well I've got no chance of losing this time
But I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down
Everybody's breaking and drinking that wine
I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
But I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time

[Verse 1]
That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay

[Chorus]
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

[Verse 2]
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And if the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That's keeping us on our feet

[Chorus]
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in
And when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

[Chorus]
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

[Post-Chorus]
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

[Outro]
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
But most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they got to get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me, you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin': you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
I was lonely
I needed someone, to see me through
I was at the end of my rope
I needed someone to cut me lose

Then an angel, out of the blue
Gave me the sense that I might make it through
And somehow I survived, with no rhyme or reason
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you

I know the color of love
(And it lives inside of you)
I know the color of truth
(It's in the image of you)
If it comes from the heart
Then you know that it's true
It will color your soul, like a rainbow
(Like a rainbow)
And the color of love is in you
Like a
Over troubled, troubled water
You stood beside me, stood beside me
And your love, did not falter

And then the angel, angel in you
Gave me the strength to know that I will get through
And that's how I survived
Ain't no other reason
And now I know I'll make it
Through the miracle of you

BRIDGE
So girl I want to thank you
I can't thank you enough
For showing me the meaning
The meaning of true love
When I was lost and so in need you to opened up your heart
When I needed you to comfort me, you opened up your arms
I couldn't face another day
You said don't be afraid
You showed my heart the, showed me the way...

The color of you...
Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before i melt away"
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, "catch me if you can"
He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, "stop!"
Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"
Hey
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)
I'm the luckiest guy in the world
'Cause I've got one pearl of a girl
For my baby I work part-time
Down at the neighborhood five-and-dime
Half of my money goes to buy her
Some of the things her little heart desires
The other half goes dime by dime
To show my cookie a real good time, because
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)

Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)
I walk around with my chest stuck out
'Cause my baby's worth braggin' about
Every Johnnie, Jack, and Jim
Wished that she belonged to him
I gave up the old gang of mine
'Cause with my girl goes all my time
One of these days I'm gonna buy her a ring
And marry her and everything, because
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
Nothing's too good for my baby
Oh, no
(Nothing's too good for my girl)
She's sweet and she's mellow
And she tells me that I'm one heck of a fellow, now
Ain't that lovin', ain't that livin'
Ain't that half the fun of givin'
Nothing's too good for my baby
Nothing's too good for my girl
She's all right and out of sight
And I love her ah-ha-ha, yeah ah-ah-ha-ha-ha ha
Ah-ha-ha yeah, I'm gonna get her a diamond ring, everything
'Cause nothing's too good for my girl, ah-ha-ha yeah

When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
Your instinct's telling you to run
Listen to your heart, those angel voices
They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind

When you've suffered enough, and your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember you're loved, and you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind

Ohhhhhh, Ohhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhh!
Ohhhhhh, Ohhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhh!

Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool. You niggas ain't got it all, you niggas just ain't you. That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose. Lil homie I got a ball of something you can't do. So suckers hate. (hate)

The same way I came into the game, If Im ever goin, then I am goin the same way
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin with no other drug. (4x)
Well I, I just came back today
I just came back from the storm
Yeah!
I said: I just came back, baby
I just came back from the storm
Yeah, from the storm
Well, I didn't know it then
But I was sufferin', sufferin'
For my love to keep me warm
It was so cold and lonely, yeah
The wind 'n' cryin' blue rain
Were tearing me up
It was so cold and lonely
The crying blue rain was tearing me up
Oh, tearing me up. (tearing me up)
I wanna thank you my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
(Thank you baby)
Thank you so much!
(Thank you baby)

The wind and lightning struck by a surprise
It was you my love who brought me in
I love you so much
I'll never stray from you again
Hey!

I just came back baby
I just came back to get my baby on her way
Yeah, yeah
It gets cold outside standing all alone
Spendin' all day the telephone
All I wanna do is go home
But I won't stop here
Checkpoints got us paranoid
They think they've got another boy
Well I got somenthin' you need to know about it, and I can't stop now
I gotta green light I'm on my way
Just turnin' to a brighter day
Everthing ain't goin' my way
So i won't stop now

Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown

Once again we do a show and
Leave with a pocket of zero dollar bills
And we fell it's asteal
But we won't breakdown
Backseat of the van
Thinkin' damn I'm the man
With the master plan
And I can't give a damn about nothin at all
I'm gonna do my thing
And not stop now
So i keep on bringin' it all
Till reach the light I
I won't stop now, I can see the light
I'm already feelin' late at the light
So I can't breakdow
Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown

Well can see it, fell it, i know (breakdown)

Well i won't breakdown
Well i won't breakdown, breakdown
Jimi:
"yeah well a like I said before we only ran up a few numbers so let
Me try and do this one like we were just jammin' at the house we don't have
A name for yet it's just like an instrumental so we'll just go along with it
It goes somthin' like this."
No lyrics. it's an insturmental like jimi said, but a great instrumental
Jimi:
"before we go any further we'd like to say that you all really had a lot of pashents
Three days worth. you've prooved to the world what can happen with a little bit of
Love and sounds. oh, I left my girlfriend at home I'm sorry. I'd like to do a thing
That a new american anthem until we get another on together. this is called 'voodoo
Child (slight return)'."
In the evenin', Mama, when the sun go down
In the evenin', Mama, when the sun go down
Ain't it so lonesome, ain't it so lonesome
When your love is not around when the sun goes down

Well, I lay awake at night
Well, I'm just thinkin' to myself
Oh, I lay awake at night
Oh, I'm just thinkin' to myself
Oh, don't it hurt so bad
When your love is lovin' someone else
When the sun goes down

When the sun rises in the east
When it sets down in the west
When the sun rises in the east, now, Mama
When it sets down in the west
Well it's harder till, it's harder till
Which woman'll love you the best
When the sun goes down
Last night, I were layin' sleepin'
I declare, I was sleepin' all by myself
Last night, I were layin' sleepin', darlin'
And I declare it was all by myself
Yeah but the one that I was really in love with
I declare she was sleepin' some place else
When the sun go down

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
Oh, when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 3]
Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

[Chorus]
We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Come on, yeah
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Oh yeah, we got it
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
(Repeat & Fade Out)
Do not waste this evening
Baby I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my believe is something I'm gonna do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you
You got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only
Only heart
It's so hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you
You got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only
Only heart
And you live like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you, but there's a hole in the cup that should hold my love
Hold my love
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear, I never will
Remember, now you
You got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
I don't need no education

He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, that I don't understand cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
And stop deceiving Lord please

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the soul that is sore
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
I've got a plan
I'm gonna find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't it remind you just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
'This won't last longer than the rest of the day'
But you're wrong this time

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing
Tonight

Stop trying to figure it out
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be the back porch poet with a book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never gonna find the perfect rhyme
For 'heavier things'
Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls
Ever breaking record off
For something someone yelled real loud one time?
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon
For the war that's raging on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

[Chorus]
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrender with their life on the line?

[Chorus]
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts a folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can

[Intro: (Teddy Riley) & Heavy D]
(Jam)
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
(One, two, three)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation
All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it, HOO

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude: Teddy Riley]
Jam, you wanna get up
Jam, you wanna get up
Jam, you wanna get up
Jam, you wanna get up

[Verse 2: Heavy D]
Jam, jam
Here comes the man, hot damn
The big boy stands with an upper hand
Making funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bumrushed the door, three and four's in a bundle
Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael
'Cause it ain't hard to...

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
Daggonit, it ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't stop
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to (Woo-hoo)
Jam (Woo-hoo)
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you (Woo-hoo)
It ain't too much for me to

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Woo
Jam

[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again (Yeah!)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be
Come on Red Rocks!

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again, hey-ey!

[Outro]
Thank you very much, for Mumford & Sons!

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"gee my life's a funny thing, am i still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(she)
All night
She wants the young american
Young american, young american, she wants the young american
All right
She wants the young american
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her ford mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "where have all papa's heroes gone?"
(she)
All the way from washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"we live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"
(he)
All night
He wants the young american
Young american, young american, he wants the young american
All right
He wants the young american
Do you remember, your president nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?
Have you have been an un-american?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have
(you)
All night
You want the young american
Young american, young american, you want the young american
All right
You want the young american
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a cadi and a lady got a chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(i heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman i can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child i can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?
(i) (repeat 3 times)
All night
I want the young american
Young american, young american, i want the young american
All right
I want the young american

[Chorus]
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Verse 1]
Watch me as I dance in up the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out: More, more!
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back, uh
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure, with seconds left I show up

[Chorus]
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Verse 2]
Get out both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
But I'm in the area, if you more (and) more
Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop then just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quittin', don't believe in that

[Pre-Chorus]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure, with seconds left I show up

Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Outro]
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more!
Ben the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see you've got a friend in me
(you've got a friend in me)

Ben you're always running here and there
(here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(anywhere)
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know you've got a place to go
(you've got a place to go)

I used to say "I and me"
Now it's us now it's we
(I used to say "I is me")
(now it's us now it's we)

Ben most people would turn you away
(turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say
(a word they say)
They don't see you as I do I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again if they had a friend like Ben
Like Ben
Like Ben
Like Ben

It's been a blue holiday since you've been gone
Oh my darling, won't you hurry, hurry home
It's been a blue holiday I'm all alone
You know I, I need your love to keep me warm
I cry when I hear the chapel bells ring
And sometimes I cry all through the night
Please oh please come, come back to me
And make my holiday bright
It's been a blue holiday my heart's in pain
My dear, I pray to have your love again

Blue blue blue blue blue holiday my heart's in pain
My dear, I pray to have your love again
I pray to have your love again
It's been a blue blue holiday

[Verse]
Remember me
I'm the girl you said hello to
And gave a special glow to
One sweet yesterday
Remember me
And the times we had together
You swore they last forever
Darling, come what may

[Bridge]
How could two people so much in love drift so far apart?
Oh, my darling, could it be possible I was never, never in your heart?

[Outro]
Remember me
I'm the girl you said you'd always love
You swore by stars above
Oh, don't you recall ever having love me, love me at all?
Jet, Jet, Jet
I can almost remember
The funny faces
That time you told me
That you were going to be marrying soon
And jet, I thought
The only lonely place was on the moon
Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh
Jet, was your father as bold
As a Sergeant Major?
Oh, how come he told you
That you hardly old enough yet?
And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette
Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Jet
And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a little Lady Suffragette
Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Jet, with the wind in your hair
Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll
Go for a ride in the sky
And Jet I thought that the Major
Was a little Lady Suffragette
Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh
And Jet, you know, I thought
You was a little Lady Suffragette
Jet, ooh
A little lady
My little lady, yes
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Hook - Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
Said Shawty wanna roll and I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
She don’t fuck on the first night, then she don’t meet my dead line
Niggas smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah molly
I’m sipping on the whole eigth of that purp shit, bed time
I cop fours like yours, y’all niggas ain’t important
Shawty want that molly, and I’ma get what she order
Tats all in my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Chris Humphrey
And make them buy me a whip nigga
Nothing less than the 6 nigga
Y’all run yall mouth like hoes, all you are some bitch niggas

[Hook:]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And Shawty wanna roll and I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Meek Mill]
Okay, your baby mama, I ball that, side chick I ball that
Main chick, I ball that, and your dream girl just called back
I’m still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don’t like me, cause they say I think I’m all that
Now come cop that ‘rarri, I don’t need to feel sorry
Niggas claiming my flows, I took petty niggas on maury
And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Roll’s, swag was surfing on ‘em like narley
Like 3 hoes like Santa Clause, saying I’m the boss, ya’ll interrupt
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn’t even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, these niggas wanna be planned all
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don’t like nigga, bang, bang

[Hook:]
They got a name for girls like me
They got a name, but no one wants to say it
They write songs about girls like me
When I'm around, no one wants to play ‘em
They'd sell their soul for a girl like me, and wonder why
They resent a girl like me 'cause I
Don't even have to try

Girls like me
Don't even have to try

It takes a nation of angry young men, and adolescent pretension
They scream poems at the top of their heads, as if they could get my attention
It takes more for a mythical beast like me to die
They think it's easy for a girl like me 'cause I
Don't even have to try

Girls like me
Don't even have to try
Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness
Why worry now
You'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
This world can seem cold and gray
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be ok just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness

[Chorus]
Ooh baby things are changing now
And I can't tell
Where I'll be from here on out
Ooh its hell
Knowing that for now
We shouldn't kiss and tell
When it's so good

You walk up to me like a stranger girl
And I already know your name
I can make you feel good
If you want to give me the time of day
Won't you listen to me here and now?
Cause I'll lay it down simple and plain
Ooh it'd be good to get together girl

But it'll be so hard to maintain
Cause it seems like now

[Chorus]
I told you already girl
That I oh I was so gone
But that sweet sweet love
Yeah it had me hanging on
So strong and I
I know now girl
That I can stand alone
I was put here on this earth
By myself whoa I gotta keep moving on
Cause it seems like now

[Chorus]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
I'm so en-captured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it, got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
I'm latching on to you
I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Messages waiting on me when
I come home
"Here he comes"
"Here he comes take one"

Here he comes, I say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Aah I gotta get my head from this pillow
I gotta get outta your
No heart fellin's
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
I gotta get outta here and I got no time to lose
Hey
Here he comes
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I gotta get my suitcase
And get the hell outta just as fast as I can
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Doo doo....

[Intro]
You want that?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
Together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
You told me that I would find a home
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals (Hey!)

[Chorus]
And "Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see

[Verse 3]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home that'll change this heart
But the welcome I receive with every start (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
(Yeah) Stars hide your fires
For these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul, oh!

[Outro]
But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
Thank you very much!
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise
And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let met go but one last time
Tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
Remember once upon a time, when I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes and mine
So tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
Just tell me you love, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
If you don't then lie, oh lie to me
And call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love
You said you was hurtin'
Almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love
Hurts you all the time
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too
You love him a little more
When you should love him less
Why pick up behind him
And take his best?
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too
You love another man
Little girl, you know, you know I love you
But you love him darlin'
Stick to him just about like glue
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too
Well, he better leave you
Or you best put him down
'Cause you know, I just can't stand to see
See you pushed around
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse]
I see you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
I ain't gon' let you come and score no points in my goa
Blowin' you out at home and always is my motto
Now watch my team take this over, one shot and I will

[Chorus]
Smack that, all on the court
Smack that, ceiling to floor
Smack that, right out the door
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the court
Smack that, ceiling to floor
Smack that, right out the door
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse]
I see you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
I ain't gon' let you come and score no points in my goal
Blowin' you out at home and always is my motto
Now watch my team take this over, one shot and I will

[Chorus]
Smack that, all on the court
Smack that, ceiling to floor
Smack that, right out the door
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the court
Smack that, ceiling to floor
Smack that, right out the door
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Zach de la Rocha]
This song is called A Bullet in Your Head
So get with this

[Verse 1]
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
They said it was blue when ya blood was red, yeah
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through your head
Blasted through your head, blasted through your head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen you was mesmerized
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn you to stone before you realize
They load the clip in omnicolor
Said they pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And motherfuckers lost their minds

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?" (Yeah!)
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Check-a, check-a, check this shit out

[Guitar solo by Tom Morello]

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?" (Yeah!)
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"
Check-a, check-a, check it out

[Verse 2]
They load the clip in omnicolor
They pack the 9, they fire it at the prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And muthafuckers lost their minds
No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
And then play it again and again and again
Until your mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and you say how high
You brain dead? You gotta fuckin' bullet in your head?

[Chorus]
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?" (Yeah!)
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say "How high?"

[Bridge]
Uh, yeah
Shit, what?

Your standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Your bowin' down to the flag
You got a bullet in your head
Am I standing in line?
Am I believin' the lies?
I'm bowin' down to the flag
I got a bullet in the head

[Outro]
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
A bullet in your head
You gotta bullet in your fuckin' head
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey] (x4)
Oh look, just look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can' t understand
Why I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or is it the sound of your hello dear
That music I hear
Oh why I get misty, whenever you're near

You can see that you're leading me on?
But it's just, just what I want you to do
Can I help it, how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And on my own, see on my very own
That I wander through this great big wide world all alone
Never knowing my right hand from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, too much in love
I say I'm just too misty
Very very very much in love
So in love, sad as could be
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness

A pretty face may be
Some guy's taste
But I'll take lovin' in its place
'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, oh baby, oh yeah, oh yeah

Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, oh yeah

My friends ask what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality

Now show me a girl
A girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one
With true lovin' every time

Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I believe that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah
So if you're lookin' for a lover
Don't judge a book by its cover
She may be fine on the outside
But so untrue on the inside

Beauty's only skin deep
Now when I saw you this morning
Tell me, why did you walk away?
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me, why did you walk away?
Can't believe that you don't love me
I thought our love was here to stay

Well, buzz me baby
I'll be waiting for you when you call
Buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
And if you forgot my number
Come on over and don't call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
Say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true

Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
I'm like a ship that's lost at sea
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973
Buzz me, baby
I said buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
If you forgot my number
Come on over and you don't even have to call at all

[Intro]
Next song of the evening is called "Marilyn and Me"
Which I wrote when I was maybe, 20
And it's about realising that Marilyn Monroe is a very sexy girl

[Verse]
Dad says that I can't go down to the picture show
‘Cause she'd open my eyes and surely I'd realize
That mom's ashamed of the way
She's blamed for that trash that she brought in
Those lashes and cotton
Oh lord
Marilyn and me
Marilyn and me
Young man you'll see
She'll make you believe
Uncle comes down from the big city town
And he takes me on out and without a doubt
I'm sitting there with my eyes locked in stare
And she's staring at me
I'll do what I please
Oh lord
Marilyn and me
Marilyn and me
Young man you'll see
She'll make you believe

There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

Upon the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
Upon the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ohh...
Ooh...
Ohh...
See heaven's got a plan for you

Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

Ohh...
Ooh...
Ohh...
Yeah!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
Sins of our tongue
Sins of our father
Sins of our young
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
Sins of our tongue
Sins of our father
Sins of our young

Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it you take it

[Chorus]
Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life, yeah
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
Inflation, no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die

[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler

Yeah, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life, ah baby

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, setbacks
Natural, fact is
Ah, honey that I can't pay my taxes

[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah now, it makes me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands, ow

[Verse 4]
Crime is increasing
Trigger-happy policing
Panic is spreading
God know where we're heading

[Chorus]
Oh baby, it make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Yeah, it make me wanna holler
But they don't understand, oh no no

[Scatting and harmonizing]

[Outro]
Mother, mother (Mother, mother)
Everybody thinks we're wrong (Mother, mother)
Who are they to judge us (Mother, mother)
Simply 'cause we wear our hair long (Mother, mother)
Woo
Ah yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi yi
Ah yi yi yi
Ah yi yi yi yi yi
Ah yi yi

[Verse 1]
Please, don't say you're sorry again
Remember I've heard you say it before
Don't say you're sorry again
You'll only hurt me some more

[Bridge]
You take such delight
And you think it's alright
In making me blue
I don't complain
Why, I've got to be insane
For stringing along with you

[Verse 2]
Please, don't, don't say it again
You'll overdo it, overdo it someday
I won't be, I won't believe anything
There'll be the devil to pay

[Outro]
Well, if that's what you want
Then just say the word
And I'll be on my way
But, please, please, don't say it
Don't say it, don’t say it again
Or you'll be sorry someday
Oooohhh...
Hey Hey Hey Hey...
I want you 

[x2]

Hey, I love the night life
Yes I do it's so much fun
And before you know it
Ah here comes the sun
Sweetheart it's been real, but...
The thrill is gone

Silence is like a spirit
That picked my house to haunt
But I know it's there so I'm nonchalant
Yet deep inside I need what I want

And I want you to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done just won't do
I want you
And I want you to genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in my baby
Don't be cruel
'Cause I want you
Would a trip to a remoted island ease your mind
Oh you look like a solitare every sunshine
I like her 'cause she's fun
And she's fearless
She's a friend of mine

And I'm not trying to say that you need some help
Or you can have anything you want with your bad self
I like her 'cause she's smart
But she's still sexy
She is somethin' else

That's why I want you to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done just won't do
I want you
And I want you to genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in my baby, don't be cruel
'Cause I want you

Oooh...
Oh one world to find a lady
That happens to be three times the lady
God is good
But he took his time when he designed you baby
That's why I want you
And
Oh I'll even quit my job
Lovin' you, I'll make it my job
Thank you Lord, thank you lord
This is it
My god!
That's why I want you

You Like The Feel Of The Bass In Your Face In The Crowd

[Verse 1: Fergie & Michael Jackson]
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Fergie]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it

[Verse 2: Fergie & Michael Jackson, both]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Fergie]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right, right, ...
Right... Ooh No!! (MJ Scream)
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson & Fergie]
You want it, you want it, you want it
Beat it
You want it, you want it, you want it
Beat it
Come get it, come get it, come get it
You want it, come get it, come get it

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Fergie]
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated (Uh)
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated (Oh no)
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it
OOOOOOO MMM MMM MMMMMMM

We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if your a lawyer or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
If you got soul we hang out with people just like you

Well my hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say we've always been Red White and Blue

Ride our own bikes to Sturgis pay are own dues
Smokin camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where i've been just look at my hands
Yeah i've driven by the white house and spent some time in jail
Mama cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel but even god he understands
My hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red white and blue

Yeah that's right.....

My daddy worked hard and so have I
We paid our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about
Yeah we love our families
We love our kids
You know it's love that makes us all so rich
That's where were at
If they don't like it they can just...get the hell out! Yeah!

My hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red white and blue
OooOoOO RED WHITE AND BLUE

YA KNOW YA KNOW YA KNOW

RED WHITE AND BLUE

YEAH

OoooOOOO RED WHITE AND BLUUUUUUUE.....
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter probably got excited
But there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way
With words

Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliché
And strange how clouds that look like mountains
In the sky are next to mountains anyway

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way but let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's

I guess you had to be there
I guess you had to be with me

Oh today I finally overcame
Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way but let me say

You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's
Just no more 3x5's
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour, nine A.M
And I'm gonna be high
As a kite by then

I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no no no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them
If you did

And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job, five days a week
A rocket man
Rocket man

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with the word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something I know
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something I know
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Oho, oho
Oho) Nothing!

(Oho, oho
Oho) Sweet nothing (Oho
Oho, oho
Oho) Sweet nothing
If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

Well I know he's not old
And I'm told he's a virgin
For he may be she
But what I'm told is never for certain
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul, yeah, yeah

Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger

Take me, take me, oh, oh
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah
Take me, take me, baby, baby, baby
Take me, take me

[Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed singing

[Chorus]
You...are...
You...are...

[Verse 2]
Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

[Chorus]
You...are...
You...are...

You...are...
You...are...

You...are...
You...are...

[Bridge]
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

[Chorus]
You...are...
You...are...

You...are...
You...are...

[Outro]
(Home) Home
Where I wanted to go

(Home) Home
Where I wanted to go

(Home) Home (You...)
Where I wanted to go (are...)

(Home) Home (You...)
Where I wanted to go (are...)

[Intro: Michael ad-libs]
Ow! Ow! Ow...
Aahh...
Hoo...
Aahh...
Hee...
Aahh...aahh...

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Life is disgustin'
So what does it mean, damnit
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit

[Janet Jackson]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

[Verse 2: Michael + (Janet)]
Tired of your tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (The story your way)
It's causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damnit

[Janet]
Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such confusion
Make me wanna scream
Now, baby
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
Schemin', baby
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

[Interlude: Janet]
Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Janet + both]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael & Janet]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Makes me wanna scream
(Stop your pressure)
Just because you know, I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna see you in misery
So come on, baby, come on
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me
Big girls ain't supposed to cry
If you do I'll understand
Maybe, I can show you
How you can win his love again
It may seem strange, I know
But it's just that I love you
So come on, baby, come on
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me
Girl, you've given him all you had
He'd better stop treating you so bad
Come on, babe, come on, oh
(Come on, come on, come on)
You can cry on my shoulder
Yes, you can, girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me yeah babe
Yes, you can now
Ooh, ooh yes
Yes, you can, girl
I'll be there to help
You can cry, you can cry
You can cry, baby
(You can cry on my shoulder)
Ooh yeah, babe, yeah babe
(You can cry on my shoulder)
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh...

[Billie Jean]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Hee hee hee, hee hee hee

[Thriller]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
(Thriller, thriller night)
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller

[Wanna Be Startin Somethin]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over(yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under(yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too hight to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
You got to be startin'
You wanna be startin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
You wanna be startin' somethin'
Somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin'

Ah...Take you there

[Beat It]
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it , just beat it

Beat it(beat it ), beat it (beat it )
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is you fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (beat it), just beat it (beat it)
Just beat (beat it), just beat it (beat it )
Ooh....
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ................
You better not 'pout, you better not shout
I slap your grandmomma's dentures out
Afroman is coming to town

Slapping her once, I'm slapping her twice
A no-teeth blowjob feels real nice
Afroman is coming to town

I know that you've been smoking all my tumble weed
I looked into my dub sack all I seen was stems and seeds
You better get dressed, hit the door
Go to the dub spot and buy some mo'
Afroman is coming to town

All kinda states, all kinda cities
All kinda women yelling "Sign my titties"
Afroman is coming to town

All the ladies in the crowd givin' me hugs
And all the fellas givin' me nugs
Afroman is coming to town
The cops always know there's drugs at the show
Before they get to the stage, I smoke up all the draw
Oh read me my rights, take me to jail
The weeds all gone and I'm high as hell
Afroman is coming to town
You move it to the left, yeah
Then you go for yourself
You move it to the right, yeah
If it takes all night

Now take it kinda slow
With a whole lot of soul
Don't move it too fast
And make it last

You know you scratch just like a monkey, yeah, you do
Real, yeah
You slide into the limbo, yeah
How low can you go?

But come on, baby
I don't want you to scuffle now
You just groove it right here
To the Harlem shuffle

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do the Harlem shuffle (Oh, do the monkey shine)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do the Harlem shuffle
Hitch, hitch-hike baby
Across the floor
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I can't stand it no more

Now come on, baby
Now get into your slide
We're gonna ride, ride, ride
Little pony ride

Yeah

Shake, shake, shake
Shake a tail feather, baby, oooh!
Shake, shake, shake
Shake a tail feather, baby, oooh!

Shake, shake, shake
Shake a tail feather, baby, oooh!
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise?
Replaced freedom with fear
You trade money for lives
I'm aware of what you've done
No, no more sorrrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived
You will pay for what you've done!
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced!
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased!
The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Ooh, ooh
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo doo-doo
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahh, and don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime

The mood is right
The spirit's up
We're here tonight
Ohh, and that's enough
We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime
Simply having a wonderful Christmastime

Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh
Christmastime
Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb
Mother do you think they'll like the song
Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls
Mother should I build a wall

Mother should I run for president
Mother should I trust the government
Mother will they put me in the firing line
Is it just a waste of time

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your
Nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here
Under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cosy and warm
Ooooh babe, ooooh babe, ooooh babe
Of course Mama's gonna help build the wall
Mother do you think she's good enough
For me
Mother do you think she's dangerous
To me
Mother will she tear your little boy apart
Mother will she break my heart

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up till you get in
Mama will always find out where
You've been
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Ooooh babe, ooooh babe, ooooh babe
You'll always be a baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high
One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"
I fail to understand
Why you don't want my hand
I try to find what's on your mind
I wonder
Why don't you stop and see?
Why you're not loving me?
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?
One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"
Why don't you stop and see?
Why you're not loving me?
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?
One minute, women,please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you, I love you, I love you"

[Verse 1]
That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
And if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

[Verse 2]
And so it starts
You switch the engines on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're blowing 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

[Verse 3]
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in
And when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
Oh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
No, you're blowing 85 days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, oh where are your friends tonight?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
To tell the truth
This could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over "Hey, I'm finally dead"
Oh, when the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you knew you were tired
But then where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

[Outro]
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
Ooh
Far East Movement
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Snoop Dogg

I bet you wake up in the morning and you kiss yourself
'Cause I would, if I was you
I bet you show up to the club and just dance with yourself
'Cause I would, if I was you

If I was you girl
Here is what I'd do girl
I'd notice me here at this table, with my crew girl
We sipping goose girl
We getting loose girl
So won't you sit up on my lap with that caboose girl
Shake it out

You ain't a doll, you're a silver dolla
It'll be a crime, if I didn't holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don't get it, let me spell it out
O-M-G, you're so sexy
You know you caught my eye with a B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G, shawty's such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let's go
Let's go

I bet you hop under the covers and play with yourself
'Cause I would, if I was you
I bet you stand up in the mirror and stare at yourself
'Cause I would, if I was you

If I was you girl
It be me and you girl
Would be no question, teach you lessons in my room girl
And if you with it girl, then you can get it girl
And if you thinkin' it, let's start drinkin', let it go girl
Check it out

You ain't a doll, you're a silver dolla
It'll be a crime, if I didn't holla
Take a second, hear me out
If you still don't get it, let me spell it out

O-M-G, you're so sexy
You know you caught my eye with a B-O-O-T-Y
O-M-G shawty's such a freak
She says she wants to go back to my C-O-N-D-O
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Purple haze, all in my brain
Lately things they don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss this guy
Purple haze, all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no

Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh, yeah!

Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?
Ooo
Help me
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze
Oh, no, oh
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me, purple haze
I can't go on like this
Purple haze
You're makin' me blow my mind
Purple haze, n-no, nooo
Purple haze

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, Oh, baby
Oh, we both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me & you
And we got nothing to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give it to you

[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Girl, you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last
'Cus you're in my arms

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, Oh baby
Oh, we both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so I give it to you

[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Girl, you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last
Cause you're in my arms
Well you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight
I've been around and I've seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet people living like Superman
All day and all night and I won't say if it's wrong or if it's right
I'm pretty fast myself but I do have some advice to pass along
Right here in the words of this song
You better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
You better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl had lived in love and for love
And over love, and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupids bow that had
Passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like
A porcupine, and she asked me
B.B. do you think I've lived my life all wrong?
And I said, The only advice I have to pass
Along is concealed in the chorus of this song
Girl, better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning
In London, England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce Limousine
Pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the Queen of England
Looking tired, just got back from a party
And the Queen leaned out and she said, Aren't you B.B. King?
She said, Oh B.B., sometimes it's so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think I ought to do? And I said
You better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
You better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
You better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
You better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...baby

Sss..Mmm
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
Sugar, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...all right

Sss..Mmm
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love

Ladies and gentlemen
I have the pleasure to present on my album
Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!
Do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your lo-o-ove

Oh, I don't care how long it might take
'Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance

Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you, oh yeah

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

I know the record is about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So if you don't like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothin' but a penny and you'll have a cough'
I know I cannot ryhme 'cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I hai ha ha ha....
(jive rap)
Now everybody's talking about the jive is in...
Well I know I've got something for your body...
Earl...Earl
Earl playing by himself, man...
Earl playing by himself, man...
Earl playing by himself, man...
Dennis playing by himself, man...
Five, four, three, two, one
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
So break my step
And relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind free from the lies
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

I got half a smile and zero shame
I got a reflection with a different name
I got a brand new blues that I can't explain
Who did you think I was?
Every mornin' when the day begins
I make up my mind and change it back again
I am a shifter of the shape I'm in
Who did you think I was?
You got my number but I always knew the score
Who did you think I was?
Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?
Is he the one who turns the ladies on?
Will I keep shinin' 'til my light is gone?
Who did you think I was?
You got my number but I always knew the score
Who did you think I was?
Here's a line that you won't understand
I'm half of a boy but I'm twice the man
Carry the weight of the world in the palm of my hand
Who did you think I was?
Who did you think I was?
Taio Cruz
Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there
Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it 'round just the way that I like
I wanna see it move like a movie on flight
She got it how I want it and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Ludacris
She got my heart jumpin'
And my adrenalin pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain't nobody ever seen
As a matter of fact I've seen this woman all up in my dreams

Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I'm attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I met her, I tell her David Guetta is on the track
Baby girl don't stop
Keep it going, you never know
When somebody gonna throw couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollars bills
Ludacris, Mr. Make-A-Woman-Holla, sing

And every night on the floor putting on a show
Everybody in the club
There's a little something you show know

Taio Cruz
Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

[Verse 1]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
And if only you could see into me

[Bridge]
When you're on the outside, baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling and I will bring you home

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
(To me, yeah)
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
(By your side, yeah yeah)

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
(To me, yeah)
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
(By your side, yeah yeah)

[Outro]
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn’t notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I’d love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I’d love to turn you on
Ev’rybody’s talking about
Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism
This-ism, that-ism, is-m, is-m, is-m
All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance
C’mon
Ev’rybody’s talking about Ministers
Sinisters, Banisters and canisters
Bishops and Fishops and Rabbis and Pop eyes
And bye bye, bye byes
All we are saying is give peace a chance
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe you're wrong, but you know it's alright
That's right

Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody say
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun and tried to blow me away

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you're gonna love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus, Lord imagine my surprise

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

(Baby let me follow you down) Let me take a peek dear
(Baby let me follow you down) Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby let me follow you down) Turn the other cheek dear
(Baby let me follow you down) Do me, do me, do me, do me

Ooh what a funky lady
She like it, like it, like it, like that
Ooh he was a lady

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes

Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across, wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day, but roll around heaven all day

Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across, wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
I like them black girls, I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls, I like them mix-raced girls
I like them Spanish girls, I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls and I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls, I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls, I like them blonde haired girls
I like them big girls, I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little-bitty weight girls
Now baby, I've got a lot of love to give
And I've been over-oversubscribed with relationships
See you've got a little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya that I can't help but play around for sure
For sure because
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
Now maybe I can learn to settle down one day
But right now I'm livin' life to mess around and play
See you've got a little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya that I can't help but play around for sure
I did it before
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls

This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply cause we wear our hair long
While the Angelus was ringing, calling for the evening pray'r
I could hear the choir singing and I saw you standing there
Silently I stood beside you, how my heart was beating then
For my dreams have all come true, I was safely back with you
Never more to roam again
Then the great cathedral spire seemed to come alive and say
Through the voices of the choir, there will be a wedding day
Then a golden ray of sunlight, from a window in the sky
Shone upon us from above, heaven's blessing on our love
Now our love will never die

Then a golden ray of sunlight, from a window in the sky
Shone upon us from above, heaven's blessing on our love
Now our love will never die

[Intro]
- Oh my God, stand by
- No, I said the wrong word
- Baby, it don't even matter, ha ha. Eight-two-oh, I mean, um, eight-five-oh, eight-five-oh-two-one, take four
- One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse]
I'm Rose of Washington Square
A flower so fair, should blossom where the sun shines
Rose, for nature didn't mean
That you should blush unseen
But be a queen in some fair garden
Rose, he'll never depart
But dwell in your heart
Your love to care
He'll bring the sunbeams from the Heavens to you
And give you kisses that sparkle with dew
Rose of Washington Square

[Outro]
I've got those Broadway vampires last to the mast
I've got no future, but oh, what a past
Miss Rose of Washington Square
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

I've been accused for the killin'
Lord knows I didn't do
For hangin' me, they are willin', yeah, yeah
And that's why I've got to get on thru
Lord, they're coming after me (a-one more time)

(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

(Now, listen) I've got two boys and a woman
They're just gonna suffer now
Lord, forgive me for not goin' back
But I'll be there anyhow
I'll be there anyhow (one more time)
(I say) Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Lord, I've got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on moving
Where I can't be found
Lord, they're coming after me

Now, maybe someday I'll find a piece of land
Somewhere not by near anyone
Then I'll send for my love, love, love, love, sweet woman
And my two grown up son
My two grown up son (yeah, yeah ...)

(I say now) Lord I've got to keep on moving ...
Sittin' in my car outside your house
(Sittin' in my car outside your house)
'Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse

T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs
(T-shirts, cut-offs, and a pair of thongs)
We've been having fun all summer long

(All summer long you've been with me)
I can't see enough of you
(All summer long we've both been free)
Won't be long til summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now

Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
(Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills)
When we rode the horse we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
Won't be long till summer time is through
(Summer time is through)
Not for us now
Every now and then we hear our song
(Every now and then we hear our song)
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
(We've been having fun all summer long)
We've been having fun all summer long
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter probably got excited
But there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way
With words

Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliché
And strange how clouds that look like mountains
In the sky are next to mountains anyway

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way but let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's

I guess you had to be there
I guess you had to be with me

Oh today I finally overcame
Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way but let me say

You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's
Just no more 3x5's
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discoverin' you, oh
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue, uh uh uh
And if you want love
(Then make it)
Swim in a deep sea
(Of blankets)
Take all your big plans

(And break 'em)
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way
The hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take
When crawlin' towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love? We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
Take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Damn baby, you frustrate me
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good, it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland, oh no

[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
You take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh
But I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Sam Martin]
Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the gas, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh yeah
And I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh yeah
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Detain the dangerous

[Bridge: Sam Martin]
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious
Oh oh oh
Dangerous
Oh oh oh
Dangerous
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental break]

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's my summer love for spring, fall and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Or caught up in sunlight, now come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine, ooh
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight, yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
I wander 'round

[Instrumental break]

Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweety face
Ride our singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Sleeping through your daydream
Sunshine daydream, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream, waiting in a cold stream
Going where the wind goes
Going, going where the wind goes
They never gonna miss us
I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Ooh, sweet morning dew
Ooh, come along and daydream
A sweet magnolia daydream
Sunshine daydream
Ooh, sunshine daydream
Ooh, sweet morning daydream
Down in some lone valley
In a sad lonesome place
Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase

Farewell pretty Saro
I bid you Adieu
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go

Well my love she won't have me
So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land

I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold

If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand
And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go

Its like
If you
Tired of that
You give yourself up...
Listen, nobody can blackmail you with anything
I'll never forget...
You know when I first...
Started to really understand what this was all about
I just went to my parents and I just started confessing about the stuff I did like in the second grade...
Seriously...
But we don't know how all that stuff from the time we're kids man...
All that repression...
All that stuff just holding you
You know all that
Talking about boys feeling my booty in the second grade
I mean I'm telling you, and I'm ashamed of that
You know?
Like no, like
What other girl in this audience played run catch and kiss or those silly games?
You know?
But just from a child, you know, growing up with all of that guilt
You know?
And we think that that's God
We think that's God...
Telling us feel guilty!
God is saying get free
Confess man
Understand that
Look
Everybody's going through that same stuff
Same issues its just a bunch of repression
And I'm saying man, life is too precious
Its too valuable
For us to just sit here in this boxes all repressed
You know?
Afraid to admit what we're really going through
You know?
I'm saying, I'm tired of that
I'll tell people, listen its so funny it's like
You know, when I tried to...
I'll never forget
When I was pregnant with my first son and I was trying to keep it a secret it was all of over the place
You know?
And when I said hey, I'm having another baby
I didn't hear about it at all
And I said man, y'all just want to deal in stuff that people don't want out
So I just gave myself out
Yeah, I'm having another child
What else would you want to know?
Yeah I'm crazy and deranged
Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so

The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so

Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't it a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Well Billy Joe told me, said every thing's lookin' fine
He got the place all secured, got the icebox full of wine
He said, "Hurry on over and don't be late"
He got three lovely ladies who just won't wait
Do some down south jukin' and lookin' for a peace of mind
Now put your Sunday pants on, let's get out on the road
We been workin' all week, and I'm thinkin' it is time we let go
He got three fine mamas sittin' all alone, gonna sip our wine and get it on
And do some down south jukin', lookin' for a peace of mind
Now come Monday morn' we'll be headin' out to the field
And we'll be doin' our thing for Papa and ol' Uncle Bill
Lord, overcome Friday night we'll be headin' to town
Tryin' to pick up any woman hanging around
And do some down south jukin', lookin' for a peace of mind
Ah yeah!
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy
This key won't unlock this door
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling
That my baby don't live her no more
Well, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back up on the hill
That's something to do
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
Yeah
In my loneliness
When you're gone and I'm all by myself
And I need your caress
I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just close my eyes
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes I love you so
And that for me is all I need to know
I will wait for you
Till the sun falls from out of the sky
For what else can I do
I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out
I'm just a link in your chain

Oh, you got me where you want me
I ain't nothin' but your fool
You treated me mean
Oh, you treated me cruel

Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

Every chain
Has got a weak link
I might be weak, yeah
But I'll give you strength, oh yeah
You told me to leave you alone
My father said, "Come on home."
My doctor said, "Take it easy."
Oh but your lovin' is much too strong
I'm added to your

Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools, oh

One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until the day
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh hey

Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools, oh

Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, oh
Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools, oh
I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway
(Just like before)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(I'm about to break)
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
(Just like before)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
These are the places that I can't feel
Torn from my body my flesh it peels
During this ride we can cut off what we like
Waiting alone I cannot resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed please someone give me a reason to peel off my face
Blood it is pouring
Blood it is pouring
Blood it is pouring
Blood it is pouring
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)

[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes, kid, show you the ropes
Got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes, kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up, kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't call the police
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house
Because the jocks can't get in the door
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up, kid, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

Well, everybody's lined up in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewin' in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up, kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

And never, never let them go
No, never, never, never let them go
Oh, never, never, never let them go
Let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Oh, never, never, never let them go
Oh, never, never, never let them go
Let them go downtown
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
"Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white"
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Tryin to find his heaven above
But he's dyin to be loved
He's tellin me livin
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He's talkin' bout lyin
It's so tragic baby
But don't you worry bout today
We got freedom comin' our way
Solo
How long
Do you
Think he is gonna last
Carryin' out on a gas (?)
See all the others say
"do what you please"
Gotta get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You gonna marry me? ha,ha
Bridge:
I'll be stone crazy
Love comin in at you
Stone crazy baby
Solo
Repeat first verse
You know what I mean
It's like walking in the heat all day with no water
It's like waiting for a friend
Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
Or losing in an argument
Although you're right can't get your thoughts in order
Still I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain
But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh I
I've told you now
You know what I mean
Although I try my best I still let down the team
You're everything I want
Why should I resist when you are there for me?
Still I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain
But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh the truth spills out
And oh I
I've told you now
I've told you now
And I've told you now!
And I've told you now!
Still I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain
But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh I
I've told you now

[Intro]
More kick and stuff in the phones, I need it
More bottom and kick in the phones

[Verse 1]
Tell me what did your daughter say, d-d-dong dong say?
All of the time
Alright, I see, alright
All of the time
Where we go, on the winds, in the wild

[Verse 2]
She told me I was a lonely man and I felt sad
She called my name then she said hello
All them who died
And I sit, in a cup, in a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems that you, dun ber ber ber lee
Har-har thin walla man
Papa say, it doesn't care for what you do
Careful what you do
Buttercup a day, hey hey hey!

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that says that I am the one (do you know?)
The kid is not my son
Hey, hey, hey
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that says that I am the one (Do you know?)
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one (Oh no!)
But the kid is not my son (Hey, hey, hey)
(Hee, hee, hee)

Get some colours on, get some colours on

Yeah
Uh, uh, ah
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

I laughed at love cause I thought it was funny
But you came along and moved me, honey
I've changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

Kiss me baby
Mmm feels good
Hold me baby
Well I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I change my knickers and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!
Well kiss me baby
Mmm feels good
Hold me baby
Well I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I have my nickles and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hand
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Oh 

[Incomprehensible] about that
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns
No, no, no, no, no
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow
Lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true...today
Came true...today
Came true... today...yes it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
Dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Yea, it makes me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God know where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply cause we wear our hair long
It's hot here gotta say it's so
I got you right where I want
Got an honest face so you turn your back
When in doubt run up your attack

At one time you were slick and your grill was cold
And now funny how the shit gets old
You can run, you can run but it will catch up
Like now see me, I'll show you up

Now you wanna get back when you had your shine
But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme
Can't stop won't stop no compromise
It's a house of cards built out of lies

Coming down like a bird floating on the mist
Turn on the track back track and twist
You work hard to climb the list
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift

I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)
You're caught now by the skin you're in
In a bind now your thoughts go to all your sins
Hits much harder back better count on that
I tell you what we know always holds us back

Now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop
I got in your heart and I shook you up
In a bind now you're caught by the fear setting in
Choked on the thought that you don't it again

Keep the competition in check
You draft your plans at your drafting desk
You try to play to win but now you lost
Like clams with no tartar sauce

Wcheming in the attic, thought you had it
So dramatic
I got the stats mathematics, automatic-systematic
She's super bad now, whatcha watcha want now?

I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)

Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger, danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)
I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)

Don't play no game that I can't win
Don't play no game that I can't win
Talking loud, talking crazy
Love me outside
Pray for the rain to come
Don't dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
I'm in your way

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
It's too much escape

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
I can't believe what I did for love

Starship watch a nigga in the backseat gold mat
Let 'er with the fix, turn around, where the dough at?

Sometimes I see a good gun, shoot without my home boys
But you ain't shit if you ain't shit without your home boys

Different things I'm sposed to do, I gotta stick to the code
That's they gave my nigga Corey life, another row
My nigga can't speak so the story's never told
I'm a break it down to you episode by episode
See my uncle in the kitchen puttin' pots on the stove
The right pimps get drugs in lil rows
I was only 'bout 10 or 11 years old
I had to get in it fast, it was money in the note
It didn't take long for I really was a spokes
See the reason stand with a handful of hoes

The first lil grinder was down for same thing
He said it was a setup, let it on some price chance
I'm a ballin' 2 fucks, you motherfuckers dead
I only feared God in the days in the pen
For all the really niggas in the Cadillacs
Ski mask up, hit 'er with yo ass up
Better get down, get your head blown

Tonight at 10
The world is ending again
And we know why and when
So you better watch
We got a bit with some feminist chick
And also a picture of a starlet's crotch!
Two people died, a double homicide
Their bodies found inside
Of a wishing well
And we tackle the flaws
In these obesity laws
In this segment that's sponsored
By Taco Bell

We've got violence, danger, sex, and drugs
And it's awesome cause all of it's real!
We do the illusion of news and while you think you're choosing the views
That you feel...

(Spoken)
We've got Chip Walker, live at the scene, with breaking news! Chip are you there?

(Sung)
Chip Walker here
Am I coming in clear?
I'm standing near
To the scene of the crime
This Iraqi guy's shop
Seemed a newsworthy spot
So we've been gathering shots here for quite some time
Today, real fast
The owner's daughter passed
We grabbed a shot of her ass
While the owner was near
Then he struck my chest
And now he's under arrest
And now you people have one less
Man to fear

This family's angry, crying, sad, and lost
And it's awesome, cause all of it's real!
I do the illusion of news and while you think you're choosing the views that you feel...
More as this develops live

We go now to Max Stevens, with the weather for the weekend
What are we looking at here, Max: umbrellas or picnic baskets?
Max? Max?!
We're experiencing technical difficulties, please stand by
Alright, we got a signal. Cut to Max

(Sung)
Good evening, hi
It's your weather guy
I advise you to buy
Another lightning rod
We didn't catch
This impending disaster
Maybe it's natural, maybe it's God
The sliding mud
The incoming flood
Will never wash the blood
From my greedy old hands!
This job was fun, I had a pretty good run
But I've never been one to give in to demands!
People are angry, crying, sad, and lost
And it's awful cause all of it's real!
We do the illusion of news and while you think you're choosing the views that you feel...
All of this and more and live
Only on the Channel 5-
Only on the Channel 5-
Only-only-on-
We're back
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me onto one
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
You're just gonna get my back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me, tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain+
You got me washed out, washed out, color drained
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
You're just gonna get my back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Talking loud, talking crazy
Love me outside
Pray for the rain to come
Don't dry again
Guess it's true what they say

Say you need a little space

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

I'm a fool for your games

I can't believe what I did for love
Do you think about me when you’re all alone?
The things we used to do we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

If you need to see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy can’t you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free…
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

[Part 1: Freak Out]

[Chorus] x5
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
So do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

Downtown
I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?
So if you're asking me
I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So if you're asking me
I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are
I want you, (& I want you)
The right way (& the right way)
I want you (Yes I do)
But I want you to want me too (Want me too)
Want you to want me, baby (& I wanna it 2 be the right way)
Just like I want you
Ooooohhhh, Oooh

Ohhhh, I give you all the love I want in return sweet darlin'
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, oh baby

I want you - the right way
I want you, dear
But I wan't you to want me, too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you
Oooooohhhh
This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair, Ooooh
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you wanna care
Ain't it lonely out there

I want you - I want you, baby
I want you
But I wan't you to want me, too

Oh, I want to get down, baby with you! (chorus: Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you)
Yeah! Darling! Ohhh, Oooo!
Get down, baby!
Whew! Have mercy!
Listen precious, I wanted you

Everything you do is just all right

Everything you do is just all right

[AMNERIS]
Every story, tale or memoir
Every saga or romance
Whether true or fabricated
Whether planned or happenstance

Whether sweeping through the ages
Casting centuries aside
Or a hurried brief recital
Just a thirty-minute ride

Whether bright or melancholy
Rough and ready, finely spun
Whether with a thousand players
Or a lonely cast of one

Every story, new or ancient
Bagatelle or work of art
All are tales of human failing
All are tales of love at heart
This is the story of a love that flourished in a time of hate
Of lovers no tyranny could separate
Love set into motion on the Nile's shore
Destiny ignited by an act of war

Egypt saw the mighty river
As its very heart and soul
Source of life for all her people
That only Egypt could control
Destruction of her southern neighbor justified
Nubia exploited, left with little more than pride
Ohhh...
(Leon Wilkeson -- Ronnie VanZant)

I was born a travelin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years of '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me
I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
That's what I am

Travelin' man -- that's what I am
No woman puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice
That's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool Lord no, and put your heart in a travellin' man
I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
(Bridge)
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
But at least I'm free

Travelin' man
Oh - that's what I am

Travelin' man -- that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely. Always movin' around
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
Oh - that's what I am
I fantasize about open wounds
Allotting time just to dream them through
Rage is the itch I'm not scratching
I guess I'm overreacting
But owning a red carpet puts me at ease

Owning a red carpet helps hide the secret
Bleaching the bathtub puts me at ease
It puts me at ease
Jimi:
"here he comes"
"here he comes take one"

Here he comes, i say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Aah i gotta get my head from this pillow
I gotta get outta your
No heart fellin's
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
I gotta get outta here and i got no time to lose
Hey
Here he comes
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I gotta get my suitcase
And get the hell outta just as fast as i can
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Doo doo....
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hand
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Oh 

[Incomprehensible] about that
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns
No, no, no, no, no
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say somethin'
Lightweights step it aside when we comin'
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street they panic and start runnin'

Words on loose leaf sheet, complete comin'
I jump on my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healin' the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk somethin', take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for

'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor

Like they understand you, in the back of their jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
And these fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank, and cashin' their cheque
Askin' you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the living room laughin' like, "What did he say?"

(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)

In my livin' room watchin', but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react to get blown into fractions

Ten years old, it's somethin' to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'

Do you see the soldiers they're out today
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show

My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back he hand-wrote a quote inside
"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like "What did he say?"

(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you
(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you
Life is so strange with it's changing yes indeed
Well I've seen hard times and the pressure's been on me
But I keep on working like a working man do
And I got my act together I'm gonna walk all over you

Gimme back my bullets, put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around 'cause I've done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done, gimme back my bullets

Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues

Gimme back my bullets, put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around 'cause I've done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done, gimme back,gimme back my bullets
Oh put 'em back........where they belong

Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well I've been on top then it seems I lost my dream
But I've got it back I'm feeling better every day
Tell all those pencil pushers they better get out of my way
Gimme back my bullets, put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around 'cause I've done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done, gimme back,gimme back my bullets
Ooh put back where they belong
Gimme back my bullets

I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one
No one ever told us about the sorrow
So how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And sometimes I've got to say

Tell me help me mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win, baby?
Please help me mend my broken heart

I think I'll let me live again

So how can you mend this broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs

Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Colosseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes, it sure has been a long hard climb

Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, life will be sweet like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
So I left Rome, and I landed in Brussels
On a flight so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform, yes, and young girls pullin' muscles
When they cheered, happy when I got right

Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece, that's right
Someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece
When I paint my masterpiece

Mamita why we gotta keep going through this
Talk to her Frankie

(verse 1)
Just Yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That i was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
And now your telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me
Its hurting my soul
Oh baby

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please dont ask of me to let you goooo
Pitbull

(Verse 2)
Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But i can't understand the reason
When you tell me your leaving
Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
Its like we are use to each other
How could we do this to each other
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now its like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
Its the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl it ain't hard to see
You mean the world to me
We had been though it all
Thick or thin right or wrong
I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong
Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go

No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let yo go

But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

Pitbull

(Verse 3)
Look baby just tell me what you want
Look baby just tell me what you need
Look baby i know im far from perfect
But the game and the money they can take cause its worthless
I know its hard to deal with my life
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen em wit this one
I done seen em wit that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice
Mami you know your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby
I just want to give you my heart my soul my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby lets try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die)
Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go

Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you goooo

But the only thing I get from it is all this crying
Tell me how am I suppose to let you goooo

How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go
No I just can't let you go

(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you gooo
(no i just can't let you go)
Clearing skies and drying eyes
Now I see your smile
Darkness goes and softness shows
A changing style

Just in time words that rhyme
Well bless your soul
Now I'll fill your hands
With kisses and a Tootsie Roll

Oh reality, it's not for me
And it makes me laugh
Oh, fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

Patti Page and summer days
On old Cape Cod
Happy times making wine
In my garage
Country shade and lemonade
Guess I'm slowing down
It's a turned back world
With a local girl
In a smaller town

Open cars and clearer stars
That's what I've lacked
But fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

Love...Hi Rick and Dave
Hi Pop...Well good morning mom
Love...get up guess what
I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell
Cause she likes
Church, bingo chances and old time dances

All my life I spent the night
With dreams of you
And the warmth I missed
And for the things I wished
They're all coming true

I've got my love to give
And a place to live
Guess I'm gonna stay
It'd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday
It's earlier nights
And pillow fights
And your soft laugh
Fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

[Violin Solo]

[Verse 1]
Spare me your judgments and spare me your dreams
'Cause recently mine have been tearing my seams
I sit alone in this winter clarity which clouds my mind
Alone in the wind and the rain you left me
It's getting dark darling, too dark to see
And I'm on my knees, and your faith in shreds, it seems

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Corrupted by the simple sniff of riches blown
I know you have felt much more love than you've shown
And I'm on my knees and the water creeps to my chest

[Chorus]
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill
Rain down, rain down on me
But plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me
Look over your hills and be still
The sky above us shoots to kill
Rain down, rain down on me

[Bridge]
Oh, I will hold on
I will hold on hope
Oh, I will hold on
I will hold on hope
Oh, I will hold on
I will hold on hope
I will hold on
I will hold on hope
I will hold on
I will hold on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I begged you to hear me, there's more than flesh and bones
Let the dead bury their dead, they will come out in droves
But take the spade from my hands and fill in the holes you've made

[Outro]
Plant your hope with good seeds
Don't cover yourself with thistle and weeds
Rain down, rain down on me

[Outro]
Thank you very much
Serve God love me and mend
This is not the end
Live unbruised we are friends
And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Sigh no more, no more
One foot in sea one on shore
My heart was never pure
You know me
You know me
And man is a giddy thing
Oh man is a giddy thing
Oh man is a giddy thing
Oh man is a giddy thing
Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design
An alignment to cry
Of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design
An alignment to cry
Of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
Love that will not betray you, dismay or enslave you
It will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design
An alignment to cry
Of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
I can't believe you're playing me like this
I thought the love we shared, the good times we've had. Remember?
Yeah

Feels like it's over
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else
Gave me the cold shoulder
But that's her loss, cause I can find me somebody else

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around
Then two can play that game, baby

You got me feeling single
About to get up
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me, girl
Feeling single
Night is young
Hit the club
Take somebody home with me
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
We can get it, baby
Get it, get it
Now I'm better single

She said 'forever'
Turned out to be the biggest lie
Of all time
And she changed my weather
Rainin' all day
No chance of sunshine

If she wanna hit the town
And party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around
Then two can play that game, baby

You got me feeling single
Feeling single
About to get up
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me
Feeling single
Night is young
Hit the club
And take somebody home with me
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Till the morning, baby
Get it get it
Now I'm better single

The way I see it, girl, not gonna do right
About me, baby girl
And I might as well (I might as well)
I might as well get out a mingle, girl
Cause you got, you got, you got me feeling single

Yeah
And I don't wanna do it, baby
But you're gonna make me
Find somebody
Who's gonna love me
Treat me right, baby
Be in my house, in my room, in my bed, in my arms at night baby
And she's gonna love me, baby
And she's gonna give all lovin' lovin', baby
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't know what it's like to land
And not race to your door
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to a hotel key in a
Bedroom neighborhood
And go sleep-walking in Hollywood

[Chorus]
I'm gonna steer clear
Burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
'Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore

I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me I love you, take a ride
The ten and the two is a lonely sight

[Chorus]
I'm gonna steer clear
Burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
'Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you
I'm gonna steer clear
Burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
'Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
See you there

I think I'm gonna stay gonna stay gonna stay in the gray
I think I'm gonna stay
All the street lights say never mind never mind
And the canyon lines say never mind
Sunset says we see this all the time, never mind, never mind

Wherever I go whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go whatever you are
I watch your life play out and take pictures from a far
Wherever I go whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go whatever you are
I watch that life play out and take pictures from a far
It's raining on Old Yeller and it's carving a path
So now we're on our way
It's taking us on journeys where we wipe away frowns
Amongst a crowded place
So why you never call me, no, you never seem to call me
Now that I'm OK
I'll beat you in the end and every time you turn around
Here will come the coming of age

Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party

My cocky look emerges when you question my moves
'Cause you ain't got no taste
You're talking 'bout my baby, I could flip you upside down
And I could mop this place
Said, why you never saw me, no, you never seen my calling
Right in front your face
I'll smoke you in the end and don't you ever turn around
'Cause here's that coming of age
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party

Ooh
She's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party

Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
Ooh
She's at my party, she's at my party
I worry, I weigh three times my body
I worry, I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain, oh
By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending
That it somehow lingered on, well I got is oh
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't (It's not supposed to)
Was there a second of time I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now, oh
So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you?
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever (yeah)
And I will wait to find
That it won't, and it won't and it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather (yeah)
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together

131 years savage generation

Jack Daniels old number 7 B
Quality, Tennessee, sour mash whiskey

[MF Doom]
Ooh, so many flows
Shit goes, so many ways down and below
20-10 thousand leagues under the sea
Motherfuckers never know it was me
Oh, that nigga' flew so many flows
It's like so many fly colors on the hoe toes
God dammit, motherfucker ruling whole planet
Gimme' two times, cut no shit, nah, fuck it
I'm coming through kicked the bucket one day
Motherfuckers never see a nigga parlay
Like, lay in the cut, like, he never knew
Motherfucker, Super Villain
And who the fuck is you? Ooh

[Kurious]
One two, one two
In order TO make a jam, kid
We gotta' get it back up in the zone
Mad shit the way we be spittin, when the writing shit is on
I'm fucking it up cause right now

[MF Doom]
See Imma be serious my next verse, Imma just be serious (Yeah)
I be starting to laugh, that's my problem

[Kurious]
That's my problem too, my shit sound like on some funny shit
You know what's hot? The way we keep talking
I'm taking off the headphones to talk to you
But it's dope, cause we talkin' and still doin' it to the music

[MF Doom]
So wait, then the beat's too loud?
I keep the beats kinda low, like this and shit

[Kurious]
No, nah I don't the levels are fucked up
Oh you mean to keep the tone down?

[MF Doom]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kinda like riding like right there, right there, be like yo

[Kurious]
Nope-a nope, nope

[MF DOOM]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling a chick like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery what Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Kurious]
People question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say shit
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man
At first I was aghast, I was mortified
When Entertainment Weekly made me swallow my pride
They made it clear that unless I
Wrote them some lame parody
There wouldn't be
A piece on my new DVD

I tried to make... them understand
I am an artist, you can't make me crank this stuff out on demand!
I am not your monkey boy
And you are not the boss of me
But if I have to stroke your egos
For some cheap publicity

I'll write this song... under duress
Just goes to show ya... extortion really works, I guess
You think I'd blow them off and kiss that plug goodbye?
Did you think I'd say no... 'cause I'm such a principled guy?

Oh no, not I
I will comply
Although frankly, I would rather jam a needle in my eye
Can't believe I'd sink this low
To promote my lousy show
Yeah, I'll comply
I will comply
Oy vey
You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)

Don't let me go
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go

Cold but in fever)

You've got me dancing and cryin

Well, my head's in misery
My heart's in a sling, I'm a walking Dr. Bill
People, my whole life is full of pain
Yes, I need my baby, people, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
Well, I walked my bedroom floor
Hung down my head and cried
I didn't exactly have the blues
I just want satisfied
Yes, I need my baby, people, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
Well, I can't sleep sound at night
I just cat-nap through the day
I can't hold out much lounger
People, livin' this-a-way, yeah
Yes, I need my baby, people, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna leave here walkin' buddy
With my clothes in my hand
I got to find my big-legged woman
Before she gets her another man, yes
Yes, I need my baby, people, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
She's a fine lookin' woman
Her shape is a dream
She's the lovin'-est female
People, I've ever seen, yes
Yes, I need my baby, people, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

[Verse 1]
I heard the ringin' on the telephone
Set aside a dream and we were on our own, oh
I could barely understand
A word came through from the other end
And now, I lay here all alone

[Verse 2]
I heard the ringin' on the telephone
I heard you ringin' on the telephone
I can’t seem to understand
A word you’ve said since you’ve been gone
But I keep hanging on

[Bridge/Outro]
I went out to the wasteland
I had no means or end
I got brains, but the quake, man
Need love to lend a hand

I went out to the wastes, man
Looking for a friend
And when you leave for your own plans
I hope that this don’t end
I want to tell you a story
About a little man if I can
A gnome named Grimble Gromble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine

He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue-green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining dining biding his time

And then one day
Hooray, another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my...

Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go

And then one day
Hooray, another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my ooh my...
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go

I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go

I'd like to be everything you want
I'd like to be everything you want
I'd like to be everything you want
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go

I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go
There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
And they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed
First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's giving me, everything will be okay
Sometimes when I wake up, and I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out, every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

♫ Instrumentals ♫

First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's giving me, everything will be okay
Sometimes when I wake up, and I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out, every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
I need you
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh yeah
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Every time
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh hey
I'm blessed… Oh hey
I'm blessed… I'm blessed
I'm blessed… So blessed
I'm blessed… So blessed

[Verse 1]
They put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
If you hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
When it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh

[Verse 3]
When there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man-trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
Oh, just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
That you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world
Ah, don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world

How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine your teeth to meaningless
And sharpen them with lies

And whatever is going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness

You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke

And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you'll ever need
That's how you fight it

Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall, love
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a pain
Meet under sun
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain
Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a change
Meet under blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain, the rain
In the rain
The rain
Got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone

My love, laying it all on your hands
Give you mine forever
Everything I am

You warm my heart when I go cold
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Whoa
My Lady Soul

I fell it in you heartbeat
Hear it in your cries
This is where our hearts meet
I see it in your eyes
I've been waiting for this moment
My love, it's a dream come alive
Heaven must have sent me
An Angel of the Night

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul
You're my lady soul
You are my life, You make me whole

Hmm, I've always knew we end up together
Right from the very start
I believe we will make it forever
It's written right here in my heart
Oh yeah

You're my, you're my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I get cold
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Whoa
My lady soul

Ooo (my, my)
Ooo (My, my)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
(My, My) My lady soul
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

[Intro: Mac Miller & Tay Walker]

Mac:
Hey, um
Taylor
Hey man I appreciate you guys coming out here
And-and-and bringing the live music aspect to my set

Tay:
I know

Mac:
And-and I know we usually do new shit
But I feel like I got some fans in here that would appreciate if we could just do some old shit real quick

Tay:
I don’t, I don’t know
In my country
In my country we don’t do old shit, no

Mac:
I-I understand baby
But just ask them
You mind change—
Just ask them, ask them
Tay:
I don’t—
Do you, do you guys want to do the old shit?

[Crowd cheers]
Oh my God, that is it
We’re doing it
We’re doing it
That is it I don’t care, we are doing it
I don’t—

Mac:
Ok
Alright you remember the one I was telling you about on a spiritual journey
The one song that came to me and told me
“Hey man you could do this. You can be a human being if you just try.”
Remember that one?

Tay:
Yes

Mac:
Lets do that one

Tay:
Lets do it

[Verse 1]

Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say
I said
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family
Make 'em say "ow", make 'em say "oh"
The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "no"
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe
Let me hear y'all sing this shit with me!
You ready?
Let's go!

[Hook: Mac & Crowd]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
Sing!
Sing!
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever
Woo!

[Verse 2]
Say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say-say
And if it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
Nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own, said
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Let me hear y'all sing this shit!

[Hook: Mac & Crowd]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be--- happy, only laughing like a child
I can't hear you!
I never thought life would be this sweet
I can't hear you!
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

[Verse 1]
Till the morning comes
It'll do you fine
Till the morning comes
Like a highway sign
Showing you the way
Leaving no doubt
Of the way on in
Or the way back out

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 2]
Till we all fall down
It'll do you fine
Don't think about
What you left behind
The way you came
Or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 3]
When the shadows grow
It'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow
It'll ease your mind
The shape it takes
Could be yours to choose
What you may win
What you may lose

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Outro]
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
You're my woman now
(Make yourself easy)
Intro:

You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, somethin new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, cuz we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick

Verse One: Nate Dogg
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feelin kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world
Verse Two: Kurupt
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!

Chorus: (repeat 4X)
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none

Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Guess who back in the motherfuckin house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em
Verse Four: Warren G
Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up bitch cuz i'm strugglin, so get
Off your knees and then start jugglin
These motherfuckin nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
Whoo!

Chorus
Feeling now, feeling down
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then I came, the one that said
Hey Dread, fly Natty Dread

And smile (In Jamaica)
Want you to smile (In Jamaica)
Get it to together right now (In Jamaica)
Get things together right now (In Jamaica)

Soulful town, roots people
Said I see that you're having fun
Rockin' to the roots man rocker
Oh island in the sun

Oh Oh (In Jamaica)
Want you get it together (In Jamaica)
Get this together right now (In Jamaica)
Get this together right now (In Jamaica)

Help the children, help them right
Oh lord help them decide
Cast away that evil spell
Throw some water in the well
Well well well well (In Jamaica)
C'mon and smile (In Jamaica)
Get things together right now (In Jamaica)
Get it together right now (In Jamaica)

Dry your tears, have no fears
Fly Natty Dread
Fly Natty Dread

Help, help, help us tonight
Cast away that evil spell
Throw some water in the well

Feeling now, feeling down
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then it came, the one that said
Hey Dread, Fly Natty Dread

Dry your tears, have no fears
Fly Natty Dread

In Jamaica...
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
And Momma just hung her head and said

"Son, Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone."
Well, well

"Hey Mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Heard them talking Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
Dealing in debt, and stealing in the name of the Lord"
Mama just hung her head and said
"Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Hey, Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone."
Uh

"Hey Mama, I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bills
Hey Mama, folks say that Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth"
And Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said

"Son, Papa was a rolling stone
(Well, well, well, well)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Lone, lone, lone, alone

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
I said, Papa was a rolling stone, yes he was
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone.."
My daddy was
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach so
She ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
And dreams of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise"
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
When I’m riding down the road in my car travelin' without you
I can still see you sittin’ there, right by my side
With the headlights of the oncoming cars flashin' in the windshield
There’s a glimmer of everything that I once saw in you

[Bridge]
Tough love can leave you almost alone
But new love brings back everything to you
All the feelings in your heart come re-awakened

[Verse 2]
Like a forest without leaves on it’s trees standing in the desert
Like the light that still leaks through when you close the door
Like the changes in our life that hits so hard that day I couldn’t find you
There’s a glimmer of everything good that once came before

[Bridge]
Tough love can leave you almost alone
But new love brings back everything to you
All the feelings in your heart come re-awakened

[Outro]
And there’s a glimmer of everything good that once came before
There’s still a glimmer of everything that I first saw in you
The dream you told me
Well I usually get bored
But this one I can't ignore
And oh
If I was on my death bed
Well, would you leave me
Walk out the door

I don't want to go alone
I don't want to go alone

I guess if I think about it
I've had the same fear all my life
And loving you can take
Won't make anything different in my world

I don't want to go alone
I don't want to go alone

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
You go too fast

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in a dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
Sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
Makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors, then rapidly
Just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda Chester Bennington]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Sick, sick, sick)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Find)
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, with Chester Bennington]
Maybe someday, I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
Used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now, you see how quiet it is all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest (Yeah)

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda, both]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda, both]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Stay away (Ready?)
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Sick)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Oh)
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Why?)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Stay away from me)
While I find a place to rest (Mothafucka)
I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally baby, the truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit, it's crying out loud
Try to believe, you say you love me but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling

I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
Finally baby, the truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
That's nothing that I didn't know

Trying to survive
You say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hangin' on to you

I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, take a little time

I, I don't want to know
Blast off, this is hobo rocket, star rider
Star rider riding through the Universe at twice the speed of light
Where do I find my horse with wings?
Riding through the Universe at twice the speed of light
Where do I find my horse with wings?
The cosmic express leaves tonight
Where do I find my horse with wings?
The cosmic express leaves tonight
Star rider, where do I find my horse with wings?
Riding through the Universe at twice the speed of light
Motorcyclist! Hetrocyclist!
Where do I find my horse with wings?
Riding through the Universe at twice the speed of light
Star rider (?)

What kind of chemistry and biology do you know?
What kind of drugs you on, man?
What kind of drugs you on?

Ha-ha-ha, that finished?
Ezekiel, thunder and lightning
The cosmic express tonight, thunder and lightning
All done? That good? Get him in here
(Can we just try something?)
It's two only and a half minutes, no, no, we're not rehearsing
We're going to do this professional and it only happens once
Get, Nick, in here, please, yeah, okay, Nick
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old thing & I
I can't take it no more
Oh, I would leave this town but I, I ain't got no where else to go
Wake up in the morning, oh, more bad news
& I. Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose & I
It's driving me out of my mind
I'll catch the next train & I. I'll move on down the line
Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long around here
& I can't live this life again
Walking down the streets you might run across a smilng face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn & walk away
& I. Oh Lord it's bringing me down
If things don't change around here, ain't no use in me hanging 'round
Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long around here
& I can't live this life again

[Verse:]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With the shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus:]
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out!

[Verse 2:]
Go, stop this show
Choppy words in that sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, Lock and Load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts. I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why, try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When I bring that chorus in

[Chorus:]
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out!

[Bridge:]
I've opened up these scars!
I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far!
I'll make you face this, now!

[Chorus:]
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out...
Well, I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Waitin' for the train, yeah
Take me home, yeah
From this lonesome place
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes
My girl had called me a disgrace
Dig
The tears burnin'
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me
Way down in my heart
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl
It's too bad

Too bad we have to part (have to part)

Big Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can make you give it up give it up
Until you say my name
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can...
And never take me out
Till you can taste the way
Do it again, and again till you say my name
And by the way
I'm so glad
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat

Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip

There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me
We can take a trip down south

Whatcha wanna do tonight?
It's still early
Wanna get some tonight

Holiday Inn
Come and meet me on my eighth floor
D--n it feels good but I feel bad for (them next door)?
And I, I I I up on the (?)
When I slip slip slip like two girls into slip n' slide
(There's a flood in your heart love)?
Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks, different tastes
I do it different ways
Where you goin?
Whatcha say?
I'm why her river flowin'
To another lake
By to ocean by the ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout' to take a swim
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I wanna make you sweat
Sweat, sweat
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
I'm a lazy lover
Undercover
Wasting time
Then one day this summer
I changed my number
To cut my line

Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know, I'll be ok
Good love is on the way

3 years broken hearted
But now her ghost is finally gone
I'm done with broken people
This is me
I'm working on (cause I know)

Good love is on the way
I've been lonely but I know, I'll be ok
Good love is on the way
Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm
Down by the door
You can take all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore

Good to go for wherever I'm needed

Good love is on the way
I've been lonely but I know I'll be ok
Good love is on the way
Oh, Good love is on the way, hey

Do it again and again
Til you say my name

Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisha sweet, I got your wrap
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me take a trip down south
I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight
It's still early
Wanna get some food tonight
She's lost 30
I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit
But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet

I'm wanna get you wet

But fuck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
Holiday Inn
Come meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
And I, and I I apologize
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slides
It's a flood in your heart love
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub, aye
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks different days
I do it different ways
Where you going
Whatcha say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean
On the beach on the beach

Let let me dip my feet and get wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip, for me mami

I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

[Chorus]
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you
In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

[Chorus]
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong
With part-time lover

If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word "discreet"
With part-time lovers

But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek to you
My part-time lover
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you
My part-time lover

And then a man caught our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers

You and me
Part-time lovers
But she and he
Part-time lovers
Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get, you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers grow through rain
But how can love grow through pain
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiarity
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be, oh
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby 'til I don't want to see
But that things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiarity, yeah yeah
I cried so much just like a child that's lost his toy
Maybe baby, you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child, my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears
Ain't that peculiar, baby
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar, honey
Peculiar as can be
Said, "I don't understand it, baby"
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't that peculiar, darlin'
Oh

[Verse 1]
We don't need your adulation
We don't need your starry gaze
How the years have come between us
You should have seen them in the early days
Should have seen them in the early days

[Refrain]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall

[Verse 2]
They don't need your reminiscing
They don't need your memories
They don't want to hear who's missing
You should have seen them when the boys were young
You should have seen them when the boys were young

[Refrain]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
Telling me to go
But hands beg me to stay
Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate
There's truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
What you build you lay to waste
There's truth in your lies
Doubts in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets, don't lie
You promised me the sky
Then tossed me like a stone
You wrap me in your arms
And chill me to the bone
There's truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets, don't lie
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets, don't lie

[Chorus 1]
Fold me up
Take me out
I'm portable
X2

[Verse 1]
Well out here we have anything we want
We have anything we want at all
Well out here we're just bolted to the floor
Or taping to the wall
Rolling with a satellite
Watching the Cosby Show on Nick at Night
It's weird but I'm feeling right
I am a soldier now

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Out here we just sing and play whatever we feel
And the threat of falling out of bed night is real
When you're traveling on a box with 18 wheels
If I can go anywhere at all x6
I mean if I really really really can go anywhere at all
Won't you tell me why x2
Why
Why Georgia why?

[Verse 3]
I am driving up 85 in the kind of morning
That lasts all afternoon, I'm just stuck inside the gloom
Four more exits to my apartment
But I am tempted to keep the car in drive and leave this shit behind

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdict less life
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Am I living it right
Why, why Georgia, why?

[Verse 4]
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with wood in places
To make it feel like home but all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis, or just a stirrin' in my soul, who knows

[Chorus 2]

Ladies and Gentlemen the B-ham choir

[Bridge (Crowd)]
So what, so I've got a smile on
It's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me, don't believe me when I say I've got it down
Everybody is just a stanger
But that's the danger in going my own way way way way
It's just the price I'm going to pay
Still everything happens for a reason
Is no reason not to ask myself if I'm

[Chorus 2]
Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey "press play" while I press up on a girl
In a mist that I smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That's real big, pop my color, pop that lid

Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard till the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand they playing my favourite song
This girl that's dancing on me ain't' got no panties on
And she gonna come back to my hotel, don't tell
Anyone about us, I'm here to party all night
Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon be some things I don't remember
So take some camera phone pictures

Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon be some things I don't remember
So take some camera phone pictures

Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this till the sun come up (the sun)
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again
Pain in my heart
Treatin' me poor
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart
Won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be?
Lord, where is she?
And one day
My days are gettin' tough
Won't you come back?
Come back, come back, baby
Lord
Pain in my heart
Won't let me be
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I wake up restless night in misery
Lord
Won't somebody stop this pain
Lord, one day
My days are gettin' tough
Won't you love me?
Love me, love me, baby
Pain in my heart
Pain in my heart
Somebody stop this
Pain in my heart
It's killin' me, baby
This pain in my heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Pain in my heart
This pain in my heart
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
But most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they got to get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me, you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin': you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go, watchin' you turn your back
Like you always do, face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never want to say but I've never
Had a doubt, it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go, watchin' you turn your back
Like you always do, face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
No, hear me out now, you're gonna listen to me
Like it or not, right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not, right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I can't feel the way I did before, don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored, time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I can't feel, don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored time won't heal, don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, "Well anyway"
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said, "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said, "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked
I just wanna be funny
Looks like the jokes on me
So call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
"Happy new year first of all. I hope we'll have million or two million more of them... if we can get over this summer, he he he. Right I'd like to dedicate this one to the draggin' scene that's goin' on all the soldiers that are fightin' in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York... Oh yeas, and all the soldiers fightin' in Vietnam. Like to do a thing called 'Machine Gun'"

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
(You know what I mean)
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down

Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground

The same way you shoot me down baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
Oooooooooo

I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After a while your your cheap talk don't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
'Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be goin' just the same
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no no

Yeah that's what we don't wanna hear any more, alright
No bullets
At least here, huh huh
No guns, no bombs
Huh huh
No nothin', just let's all live and live
You know instead of killin'
Hey, everybody, let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done, so
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
If you wanna have a ball
You gotta go out and spend some cash, and
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

Hey Mr. Landlord, lock up all the doors
When the police comes around
Just tell 'em that the joint is closed
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

Hey tell everybody
Mr. King's in town
I got a dollar and a quarter
Just rarin' to clown
But don't let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

No matter whether rainy weather
Birds of a feather gotta stick together
So get yourself under control
Go out and get together and let the good times roll

There go the gun click, 9-1-1 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Hold up! ERRRRRRRR!

I'm not in this town to stay
Said a lady old and grey
I'm Just here to get my baby ou of jail
Yes, warden, I'm just to ge my baby out of jail

I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your clothes
If that will get my baby out of jail

I will pawn you my watch
I will pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring
Yes, warden, I'm just to ge my baby out of jail

When those gates swung wide apart
She hel her darling to her heart
She kissed kissed her baby boy and then she died
Yes, warden, in ther arms of her dear boy there she died
Yes, warden, in ther arms of her dear boy there she died

[Verse 1]
I wonder why
I'd remember pain on a whim
But now I can’t seem to shake this smile
Wear a gilded grin all the while
For I know I’ll need her all of the time

[Verse 2]
I wonder how
Grandmother’s touch wasn’t enough to stick around
But the trouble I found
Fades steady now from brown unbound
For I know I’ll need her all of the time

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
*Talking*

[Verse 3]
Well, I...
I'd never let her go, she’s not like them
And never has she been just one of those people
Ordinary people
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after that same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me
She called when I was working
Of course that means nothing
As I stare at the wall thinking how to help my family
Cannot get it through to him
Or do I want that happening

I'm wanting you
To get me there

'Cause I will talk to you
'Cause I will talk to you
'Cause I will talk to you
'Cause I will talk to you

Please don't make a joke of me, 'cause
It makes me seem really weak, and
Like you aren't by my side

I want to get in my brother's car
And drive it somewhere ???????
I want to hold my dad's hand
To take him to ????????
I wanted you to give me that, that, that, that
I will talk to you
'Cause I will talk to you
'Cause I will talk to you
'Cause I will talk to you
I've had some hard times in years now gone by
I've had my heartaches my cup has been dry
But I've never been kicked and publicly scorned
And I've never worn a crown of thorns

But I have somebody who did that for me
The miracle man of Galilee

I've got scars that show that the goin' was rough
And I can remember when I almost gave up
But I've not been rejected by my fellow man
And I've never had nails through my hands

But I have somebody who suffered for me
The miracle man of Galilee

I've had disappointments they still come and go
They say man must suffer and it surely is so
I've had mountains to climb and I always will
But I don't have to climb Calvary's hill
But I have somebody who did that for me
The miracle man of Galilee
I don't need no drugs to calm me down, down, down
And I don't need your hands to hold me down, down, down
I don't need your tongue to cut me down, down, down
I don't think that I need you at all
I don't think that I need you at all

All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse 1]
I did a thing last night
You know those future games
I turned off all the lights
Oh, the future came
You were by my side
Will you explain-oh yeah
Real rhyme or reason for those future games
Now you were there last night
And oh were you afraid
Of things we'd come upon
While playing future games
But baby it's alright and so have faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, you invent the future that you want to face

[Chorus]
How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Inherit the world, or inherit the night
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain

[Post-Chorus]
Well I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games

[Verse 2]
You better take your time
You know there's no escape
The future sends a sign
Of things we will create
Baby it's alright
And so have faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, you invent the future that you want to face

[Chorus]
How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Inherit the world, or inherit the night
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain

[Post-Chorus]
Well I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games

[Outro]
Future games...
Future games...
Future games...
Future games...
Future games...
Future games...
St. Stephen
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain
Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again
Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrapped the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills
Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore walk by the suds and the foam
Been there so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a calling, calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer, "Yes I can"?
But what would be the answer to the answer-man?
High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender, they're crawling to the
Sun
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita, stark and shiny in the
Breeze
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and droop so hungry neath
The sky
William Tell has stretched his bow til it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before
(Leon Wilkeson -- Ronnie VanZant)

I was born a travelin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years of '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me
I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
That's what I am

Travelin' man -- that's what I am
No woman puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice
That's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool Lord no, and put your heart in a travellin' man
I'm a travelin' man
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
(Bridge)
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
But at least I'm free

Travelin' man
Oh - that's what I am

Travelin' man -- that's what I am, Lord I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely. Always movin' around
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man -- that's what I am
Travelin' Man
Oh - that's what I am
What shall we use to fill the empty
Spaces where she used to walk
How shall we fill the final places
How shall we complete the wall?

[Chester]
When I look into your eyes there’s nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me

[Chester Bennington]
I’ve lied to you
This is the last smile that I’ll fake for the sake of being with you
(everything falls apart even the people who never frown eventually break down, everything has to end you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
For the sake of being with you
(everything falls apart even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus]
Why I stayed when you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me
I’ve tried, like you, to do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I’ll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Mike] Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down

[Chester]The sacrifice of hiding in a lie

[Mike]
Everything has to end You’ll soon find we’re out of time left to watch it all unwind

[Chester] The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus]
Why I stayed when you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me

[Mike]
Reverse psychology is failing miserably
It’s so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you

[Chorus]
When I look into your eyes there’s nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why

[Pre-Chorus: Chester]
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus]
Why I stayed when you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me
Why I stayed when you just push away
No matter what you see
You’re still so blind to me
Do you think about me when you’re all alone?
The things we used to do we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

If you need to see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy can’t you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free…
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
These days, with the world getting colder
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I'd planned

Tonight we're gonna order in
Drinking wine and watchin CNN
It's dark I know, but then again
It's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain
Now, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain

From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back
Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
Cause she's the brightest thing I've got
When I'm covered in rain
Cause I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
Cause I'm covered in rain
No I'm covered in rain

And come December, Lydia left
She mentioned something 'bout it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree, and it's killing me
And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers round a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet
But it's the brightest thing I've got

When I'm covered in rain
Now, I'm covered in rain, rain
No, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
I'm covered in, covered in, covered in rain
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be out fought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be out fought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
God save us everyone
When we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns, oh
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
(And it can't be out fought, it can't be outdone)
(It can't outmatched, it can't be outrun, no)
Lift me up, let me go
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be out fought, it can't be outdone
It can't outmatched, it can't be outrun, no
Lift me up, let me go
(God bless us everyone)
(We're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Lift me up, let me go
(And it can't be out fought, it can't be outdone)
(It can't outmatched, it can't be outrun, no)
When I grow up to be a man

Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?

Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(14, 15)
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?
(16, 17)
Well, I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
(18, 19)
When they're out having fun, yeah, will I still wanna have my share?
(20, 21)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
(22, 23)
Won't last forever
(24, 25)
It's kind of sad
(26, 27)
Won't last forever
(28, 29)
It's kind of sad
(30, 31)
Won't last forever
I'm steady tryna find a motive
Why I do what I do?
Freedom ain't gettin' no closer
No matter how far I go

My car is stolen
No registration
Cops patrolin'
And now they don't stop me and I get locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Headin' uptown to re-up
Back with a couple keys
Corner blocks on fire
Under covers dressed as fiends

Makin' so much money
Ride up smooth and fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

'Cuz visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty

My cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Maybe a visit
Send me some magazines
Send me some money orders

Maybe a visit baby
'Cuz I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer?
I'm locked up
Get me out of here
I'm locked up

Baby, I'm locked up
Where's my niggas, on the lock-down?
Damn, I'm locked up

I'm locked up
Oh
Can you please accept my phone calls?
'Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up

[Intro]
You don’t mess around with Walder Frey…
(Don’t mess around with)
You don’t mess around with Walder Frey…

[Verse 1]
If you’re here for the wedding of Robby Stark
Keep the car running, there’s no need to park
He’s not going to make it, through the night…
Keep that wedding cake in the fridge
He didn’t pay me back for using the bridge
I’m afraid this wedding won’t be white…

Boom, boom, boom, babba dippi dum
Boom, boom, boom, babba dippi bum

[Verse 2]
Red wedding, red wedding
Lots of stabbing and a bit of beheading
The Rains of Castamere are here to stay…
Red wedding, dead wedding
A head, shredding, bloodshed wedding
There will be no wedding bedding, hey
You don’t mess around with Walder Frey!
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

(Everything falls apart even the people who never frown)

(Eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end youll soon find)
(Were out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart even the people who never frown)

(Eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end youll soon find)
(Were out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
(We're all out of time, this is how we learn how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time, this is how we learn how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away, pushes me away

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a money getting nigga
At least that's just what I'm known for
You better call on my connect
And ask him what he put me on for
I heard ya niggas ballin'
Then why the fuck you take a loan for
Better get the fuck out East Atlanta
You niggas know you don't belong here
All my niggas smoking strong here
We don't talk reckless on the phone here
A lot of cliques don't get along here
Bricksquad my nig, we rock our own gear
I'm on the crib sitting on my lawn chair
I hope you don't read me wrong
But if I go pull out that tone dear
I bet that you don't make it home
I'm in the trap house with my long johns
And I been trapping all day long
They call me baking soda Armstrong
Before it dry that shit be gone

[Hook: Gucci Mane & Meek Mill]
I'm a money getting nigga (money getting nigga!)
Atleast that's just what I'm known for (that's just what I'm known for!)
You better call up my connect (my connect!)
And ask him what he put me on for (what he put me on for!)
I heard ya niggas ballin' (ballin!)
Then why the fuck you take a loan for (loan for!)
(You better stay up out of Philly nigga
You know you pussies don't belong here!
Meek Milly!)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Rose gold on my bottom six, half a mil on foreign whips
I'm in the wheel with a foreign bitch
I'm on the bra strap, she on this dick
Just bow down you lame, your diamonds look strange
I'm grinding like Wayne
When he on that skateboard, I'm safe!
Nigga your new girl, my old bitch
My old bitch, your new girl
Young lil rich Philly nigga
Them hoes tell me I'm too thorough
I don't even fuck one on one
Cause when I come, I need two girls
That's down to fuck like all night
Get them bitches that hard pipe
Ridin' with with a ho named Keisha
And we smoking on Keisha
Young nigga fresh like Easter
Blood dripping on my sneakers
Straight drop I stick that
I sell a brick, I get back
That Molly look like a Tic Tac
And I tell a ho that shit back like Whoa!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I drop a bag on yo' head nigga
And they'll locate yo' ass like OnStar
I ain't have to buy shit nigga
My nigga Waka got his own car
You on my dick, like you a bitch nigga
Why don't you go and quote yo' own bars
And I don't want to go back to jail nigga
But you gon' make me catch one more charge
I could look and tell you're frail nigga
But you keep on tryna to look hard
Your friends keep asking "what's the smell nigga?"
That's your motherfucking homeboys

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Hey, not, not, not, not (Not fade away)
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away (Bop, bop, bop bop)
You know our love will not fade away (Bop, bop, bop bop)
You know our love will not fade away (Bop, bop, bop bop)
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Oh, I've really got those ozone layer blues
From my elbow down to my shoes
So let's throw another fire on the logs

Now we can go downtown and fill the latrine
With genuine Columbian lima beans
Dynastic and elastic, it's all made out of plastic
There's nobody here but us frogs

I'd like to find a girl who really cares
About the size of my nasal hairs
She could feed bananas to the dogs

We could climb the church and look down from the steeple
Where all the ants look like people
Nutritious and delicious, it's even surreptitious
There's nobody here but us frogs

They say I'm crazy
But I couldn't care less
Why don't they leave me alone
Can't they see that I'm happy to be a psychiatrical mess
I get a thrill
Bein' mentally ill, yes I do
They seem to think it's a crime
But it's a pleasure sublime, oh yes

That's why I'm happy here inside these padded walls
Makin' obscene telephone calls
And throwin' TV dinners to the hogs

I never trust a naked Eskimo
And don't you eat that purple snow
Revolting and disgusting
My belly button's rusting
There's nobody here but us frogs

They say I'm crazy
But I couldn't care less
Why don't they leave me alone
Can't they see that I'm happy to be a psychiatrical mess

I get a thrill
Bein' mentally ill, yes I do
They seem to think it's a crime
But it's a pleasure sublime, oh yes

That's why I'm happy here inside these padded walls
Makin' obscene telephone calls
And throwin' TV dinners to the hogs
I like to eat my ice cubes boiling hot
And Wilshire Boulevard's a Commie plot
Amazingly congruent, and commonly affluent
Innately effervescent, surprisingly incessant
Superblier commended, eccentric and demented
There's nobody here but us
Nobody here but us
Nobody here but us frogs, I mean it
Nobody here but us frogs
Well, I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Waitin' for the train, yeah
Take me home, yeah
From this lonesome place
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes
My girl had called me a disgrace
Dig
The tears burnin'
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me
Way down in my heart
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl
It's too bad

Too bad we have to part (have to part)
Dig
Gonna leave this town, yeah
Gonna leave this town
Gonna make a whole lotta money
Gonna be big, yeah
Gonna be big, yeah
I'm gonna buy this town
I'm gonna buy this town
An' put it all in my shoe
Might even give a piece to you
That's what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White heat shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now, goodness knows

White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White heat shaping way down to my toes
White light - White light could kill me now, goodness knows

Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White heat shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now, goodness knows

White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White heat shaping way down to my toes
White light - White light could kill me now, goodness knows
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

White light's a-flashing
White light
Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
Oh, I can see you standing there now
And your the prettiest thing in the crowd
And guess who be laughin' loud, but me
You made me see the love that you're givin' me
Baby, won't you hold my hand?
Now, that kinda makes a fool understand
Just let me know that I'm your man
And show I'm not ashamed
I walk the floor when you leave me
Hey baby, I don't know 'bout you
But let me tell what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to make my dreams come true
With you, with you
Baby, yeah, I wanna say
I been cryin' without your love
The night time find me
Wetting my pillow, but I
Yeah, I don't, I don't mind, no, but if you
You just let me say it again, I've been cryin'
I wish our trouble would leave me alone
But I've been cryin'
Oh, come on and stop the rain right now
Yeah, stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain
Baby, baby, yeah
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said, son

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, (my son, yeah)
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey Momma!
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life
And Momma, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that
Papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
Heard some talk Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Momma just hung her head and said
Papa was a rolling stone, (my son)
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey Papa was a rolling stone, (dad gumma it)
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey Momma
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey Momma
Folks say Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son
Papa was a rolling stone, (well, well, well, well)
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone (lone, lone, lone, alone)
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
(I said) Papa was a rolling stone, (yes he was my son)
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
(My daddy was, yes he was, yeah he was)
(Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home)
The other day they waited
The sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated
"He has to die
You know he has to die"

And all the children learning
From books that they were burning
Every leaf was turning
To watch him die
You know he has to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
But it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die
Spanish lady come to me
She lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round
It trembles and explodes

It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away
But the heat came ‘round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)

Escaping through the lily fields
I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded
Left a bus stop in its place

The bus came by and I got on
That's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel
Of a bus to never-ever land

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die

He had to die
You know he had to die

He had to die
Well, you know he had to die
Free, that's all that she could bleed
That's why she'll never stay
White, bare naked in the night
And lookin' for some play

Just another girl that wants to rule the world
Any time or place
And when she gets into your head
You know she's there to stay

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
Slow, she's burnin' in your soul
With whispers in your ear
It's okay I'll give it anyway
Just get me out of here
You'll plead, you'll get down on your knees
For just another taste
And when you think she's let you in
That's when she fades away

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind

You want it
She's got it
Molly's chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

Molly's chambers gonna change your mind
You want it
She's got it
Molly's chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

She can't be found
But love doesn't care, doesn't care
Ah, don't despair
The next time around, she'll be there

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

I wouldn't make her
Her wooden table, I wouldn't care
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Don't be long
My heart isn't strong, don't be long
Ah, never fear
The next time around, she'll be here

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back

Hey diddle, I want you back, diddle, I want you back
Like a long lonely stream
I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on
There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
(Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
(Hope for ev'ryone, hope for ev'ryone)
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
(Poor restless heart, poor restless heart, run)
I know, there's a place in the sun
(Place in the sun, place in the sun)

[Intro: Aretha Franklin]
Jesus is the light of the world
Come on, choir

[Verse: (Aretha) & Choir]
Walk in the light (Walk in the light)
Beautiful light (Well, it's a beautiful light)
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright
Oh, shine all around us by day and by night
Jesus is the light of the world
(I wonder do you know it this evening, yeah, yeah)

Walk in the light (We're gonna walk in the light)
Beautiful light (Well, the beautiful light)
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright
Oh, shine all around us by day and by night (Oh Lord)
Jesus is the light of the world (Oh, oh yeah)

Walk in the light (We're going distance, yeah)
Beautiful light (We're going the distance with the Lord, oh yeah)
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright
Oh, shine all around us by day and by night (Oh Lord)
Jesus is the light of the world

[Outro: (Aretha) & Choir]
He's shining (Yes, He's shining)
He's shining (Oh yes He is, He's shining)
Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers that are hangin' out at the bar
Near the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On every thing that the momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange

Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near her
And she'll shine once she's crossed the line
'Cause all tied to a chair"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"

All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are they're 

[Incomprehensible] in a slab
Doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight
Ah, tonight, tonight, tonight
Ah, maybe tonight
Said old Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near her
And she'll shine once she's crossed the line
Hands all tied to a chair"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"

Comes home on call, ain't now that peace?
Fingers in the dirt, spitting out his teeth
Spitting out his teeth

Comes home on call, ain't now that peace?
Fingers in the dirt, and he's out spitting all his teeth
Spitting out

Said Pa, "She don't get off
Unless somebody's standing near
And she'll shine once she's crossed the line
Hands all tied to a chair"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"

I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"
I said, "Lay it now on the ground
Throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten"

[Verse 1]
Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner pies

[Chorus]
And we walked off to look for America

[Verse 2]
Cathy, I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburg
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gaberdine suit was a spy
I said be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
Cathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike

[Chorus]

[Instrumental break]

Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike

[Chorus]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you
But on and on from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in a line
Just to see if you care
Do you want me to change
Well I change for good
And I want you to know
That you always get your way
I wanted to say
Don't you shiver, shiver, sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you
And is this is my final chance of getting you
And on and on from the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care
If you care
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Did she want me to change
Well I change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting
And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear, so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me

Nigga jealous cause I got good crack cola
While their shit is packed with baking soda
I'm on the bandwagon why not
Niggas sayin they got the same shit I got
Its because I'm takin the money
Cause I got my shit from bounty
With a little bit of cut in it
All you got is a couple of bucks
Go head and spend it

But money ain't all good
Cause a raw deal will get your ass at the Wackerweel
My niggas don't have any bucks wit em

Now they runnin
Up to a niggas spot

Ugh, I look out my window with my Glock

That's what I got, I run in the spot, because I advertise
Plus I got the humongous rocks, soda for blocks
Nigga I got more locks then Goldilocks
It's time to make my rounds black
The cops are getting hopeful
I sense they jacked so I get mobile
I got two pop cicles and a cookie left
Shucks, I got myself nine bucks
Cause I give no credit, and I mean that
You won't see that nigga until next month
And when he come to spend
For himself, but he be claming that he comin for somebody else

Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was till now
I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
Ya'll oughta stop talking
Start trying to catch up mother fucker
And all the people say
Aaaaaaaah aaaaaaaah
Try to catch up mother fucker
Lauryn said money change a situation
Big said it increases the complication
Kane said don't stab, I ain't the one
Chuck said a Uzi weighs a mother fucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage in every place that they brought me
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken Imma state that for the record
I am the opposite of whack, opposite of weak
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat
Synonym of crack, closest to a peak, far from a punk
Ya'll oughta stop talking
Start trying to catch up mother fucker
And all the people say
Aaaaaaaah aaaaaaaah
Try to catch up mother fucker
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me
I'll be gone
And all the people say
Aaaaaaaah aaaaaaaah
Try to catch up mother fucker
Aaaaaaaah aaaaaaaah
Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

Do... do...
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Hmm hmm

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love,love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love
Do... do...
Do do do do do
Hmm hmm...

There's a ribbon in the sky for our love
I've these dreams of walking home
Home where it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
But it's a bitter sweet feeling hearing
'Wrapped around your finger' on the radio
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more
Like they were at the start of me
Had it made in '83
Thinking 'bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
Well, he looks just like his brother John
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling 'cause I'm scared as Hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well
Well, these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more
Like they were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
Plot a course to the source of the
Purest little part of me
And most of my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If Heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me, care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards, replace the shutters
But that's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my, whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision
If only my life
If only my life
If only my life
...
Drinkin' again
Thinking of when you loved me
Having a few
Wishing that you were here

Making the rounds
Buying a round for total strangers
Just being a fool
'Cause I keep hoping, hoping, hoping you'll appear

Sure I can borrow a smoke
I can sit here all night and tell these jokers some jokes
But who wants to laugh, who's gonna laugh at a broken heart
Oh, my heart is aching, I swear it's breaking

And I'm drinking again
Thinking of when you loved me
And I'm tryin' to get home
With nothin', nothin' but a memory

Yes, I'm dying to get home
Dying to get home
And I got nothin' but a bottle of beer
And just my memory
"Yeah, here we go...just go with the flow"
"Yeah, here we go...just go with the flow"

Yo, I'd like to check this microphone before I start right quick
Microphone check 2,2,1,2,1,2

[Verse 1]
Big up all the Monsta' Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
He ask me what we don't got that you got son
For one, flow that's elementary my dear Wat-son
Secondly, ever since I was little
Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chop these drums off
Truly yours, G Rap
Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical loss, black
I'm not the cool sleet stack
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to you, niggas who be bitin' styles I'm like pork too
Oooh...what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the style's from the cess
Shit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super muthafuckin' villain grip the mic wit an iron hand
Throwin MCs to the fire from out da fryin' pan
It ain't no use in tryin, man
Son, stop cryin
Frontin' like you death-defyin'
You need to stop lyin'
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you
With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?)
Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown
(Word, only them two niggas?)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up
(True, true)

[Verse 2]
I'd like to say hi
It's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Sterling

[?] bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God ?, never see God earlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lake toast
Back to you MF DOOM, you late show host

[Verse 3]
S to the U to the P-E-R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
Thriller porno co-star or in a realer drama
Break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower
The lone gunmen who candidly flip-fly floes
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt 

[?]
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay
That's in a smash way how he did it
Muthafucka' probably couldn't peep it past a minute
Shit, word

"Yeah, here we go...just go with the flow"
Oh!
You're so sexy, yo!

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

We knew this type of life didn’t come with instructions
So I’m trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright in fact
When you call and I don’t know what city I’m at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month

In a year I don’t recall
It’s like my life’s on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn’t be long
That was last November, now December’s almost gone
I’d apologize but I don’t realize what I’m doing wrong
I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

And you’ve been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o ‘cause they’d a just been over it

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don’t hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We’ll just drive by and keep waving

'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home
No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We’ll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let’s go

I don’t care what you’re after
As long as I’m the one, no
I don’t care why you’re leaving
You’ll miss me when you’re gone

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

I'm home baby!
Ha Ha
I get stoned
I can't go home
I'm calling long distance on a public saxophone
My head is achin'
Lord my mind is breakin'
Feel I got run over by Captain Coconut and his dog named Rover
Gotta keep on movin'
Gotta keep on movin'
To understand both sides of the sky
You gotta keep on groovin' yeah
Good groovin'
'Cause you got your God and so do I
We gotta keep on lovin'
Good, good, good, lovin'
Make love on my dyin' bed
We gotta stop smokin', stop, stop
I mean cigarette smokin'
Or else I cough myself to death
And to make love to you baby
I wouldn't even have the breath
We gotta keep movin'
Keep on groovin'
Understand both sides of the sky
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
You got your God and so do I
Well the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door
Think this through with me, let me know your mind
Wo, oh, what I want to know, is are you kind
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Will you come with me won't you come with me
Wo, oh, what I want to know, will you come with me
Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like
Their wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go
I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go
Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go
Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
When I step on the scene
Ya'll know me, cause I walk with a limp
Like an old school pimp or a real og
I rocking VANS
I'm in the sand
I've a got a red bull and vodka up in my hand
Hey, you're looking kind of cute in that polka dot bikini, girl

Breaking a Bud, now we drinking some liquor
Watching a game, taking a blast
My football team be kicking, mucho ass
Throw me a pass, make me a block
I fuck a nigga up that leave your cornerback pop
The game is over, the rage rover
I come to the field to knock your head off the shoulders
They know me I'm bolder and South Dakota
I get a lot of money from hip hop promoters
I mix my Henny with Coca-Cola
You see me wearin' stillers all the time because I'm a roller
From pits 

[?] to Barcelona

I wanna, I'm gonna, get her
Enter the danger zone
Let's get it crackin' man, the game is on

[Hook]

You know it, we be blowin' niggas out
Huh ye, blowin' niggas out ye
Blowin' niggas out, blowin' niggas out like afros

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield

[Verse 2]
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Verse 3]
Well, you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves, you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Outro]
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
Thank you very much, we're Mumford & Sons. Thank you so much
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
"Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white"
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it

You can tell in your heart what it?s gonna be
When you feel the fire like when you're holding me
I took a chance when you sung and danced
Let me feel like plans could be made for us both to be

Lovers and friends ?til the end, what it?s got us in
Never would?ve thought it was you that would choose me
Now I'm on a flight, ain?t afraid of heights
I can breathe right, exhale, ?cause you did something to me

When you made me feel loved, really made me give up
When I didn't see much, when I felt your touch
What a man say once in the first 12 months
I ain?t heard in my life from the closest one
There's so much I knew, too good to be true
When it came so fast, what's a girl to do?
Never will I say when a man won't change
?Cause you changed my life and I'm so d*** happy baby

Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it

Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it
Every time enough is enough, you love me full time
So I know that it's me, that it's me that you're living for
A little hug and a kiss to show me you miss me
An? all you really want to do is be here with me

Lovers and friends ?til the end, what it?s got us in
Never would?ve thought it was you that would choose me
Now I'm on a flight, ain?t afraid of heights
I can breathe right, exhale, ?cause you did something to me

You made me feel loved, really made me give up
When I didn't see much, when I felt your touch
What a man say once in the first 12 months
I ain?t heard in my life from the closest one
There's so much I knew, too good to be true
When it came so fast, what's a girl to do?
Never will I say when a man won't change
?Cause you changed my life and I'm so d*** happy baby

Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it

You know when you really know
You know in your heart that you fell in love
Let this feeling make you lose control
And just let go because you know when you know, you know
You know what you want when you feel that you want it
You know when you know

Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it

Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know
When you know, when you kn-kn-know kn-kn-know, right?
Know, when you know, you know, you kn-know, right?
You know what you want when you feel that you want it

You know what you want when you feel that you want it
You know what you want when you feel that you want it
Every day
Every day I have the blues
Every day
Every day I have the blues
When you see me worried baby
Because
It's you I hate to lose

Oh, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Yes, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Speaking of bad luck
And trouble
Well you know
I had my share

I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Yes
I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Where there
Ain't nobody worried
And there
Ain't nobody crying
I need the ground when I shake my brain I must have felt the sound
You were travelling on, following Zond
Four deep tonight in sixty-five we were left for God
Tell me what went wrong, what about Zond?

When I found the ghost, it's meaning after all
I'm gonna tell you what I saw, and where it came from
Well, when I'm 'round the door, when I'm 'round the made it back down
Leave it all where we started this song

A song about Zond
Cross my heart, universe, go black on me
After all I've seen, in a waking dream
We're from the darkness in between

Gently unscrew me
I wanna love me Julie, gonna do me Julie
But the light and the sun and the moon and sound
A merry-go round

And I misbehave, well, I keep awaiting, trying to meditate
When I'm on my round
Oh all the elegant sound
Now I'm like the dog on a satellite home
And I'm flying high and it must be found
When I'm 'round the door I made it back down
And it all really-really is Zond, a song about Zond
Cross my heart, universe, go black on me
After all I've seen, in a waking dream
I'm from the darkness in between
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen?
But you can do something in between
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said, baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep, beep, beep, beep, yeah
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star one day
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl I could start right away
And she said, listen baby, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep, beep, beep, beep, yeah
Beep, beep, beep, beep, yeah
Beep, beep, beep, beep, yeah
Beep, beep, beep, beep, yeah
Me not working hard?
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak

Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-yo, Tesra

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Get busy tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to do battle, perform for princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless

It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us
So I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my lap, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handled love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab them, at least you're on top of the
World
Think about it
'Cause if you slip, I'm gonna fall on top of your girl
When I'm involved, it goes deeper than them aces
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family is from Cuba, but I'm an American Idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest

Put it on my light, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

[Bridge]
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Chorus]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way, shake the excess

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 3]
Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So take my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind free from the lies

[Bridge]
And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
Well, thank you very much!
By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
For I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
I'm telling you that's my home
You had romance, did you break it by chance
Over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Mm, that's my home
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat, oh oh, that's my home, mm yeh
That's my home
And I like it that way
Till the morning comes, it'll do you fine
Till the morning comes, like a highway sign
Showing you the way, leaving no doubt
Of the way on in or the way back out
Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine
Don't think about what you left behind
The way you came or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow
Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow, it'll ease your mind
The shape it takes, could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose
Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
You're my woman now, make yourself easy
Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes Im in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need you to go
Dont stay, forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
Dont stay, forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and dont stay
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes Im in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow I need to be alone
Dont stay, forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
Dont stay, forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and dont stay
I dont need you anymore, I dont want to be ignored
I dont need one more day of you wasting me away
I dont need you anymore, I dont want to be ignored
I dont need one more day of you wasting me away
(With no apologies)
Dont stay, forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
Dont stay, forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and dont stay
Dont stay
Dont stay

[Verse 1]
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan?
Everybody sing

Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land?
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand?
Everybody sing

Go!

I'm gonna wake you up early 'cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

It's not a big motorcycle, just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys, that two-wheel ride
We'll ride on out of the town to anyplace I know you like

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

It climbs the hills like a Matchless 'cause my Honda's built really light
When I go into the turn, lean with me, and hang on tight
I better turn on the lights, so we can ride my Honda tonight
First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

First gear, it's all right
Second gear, I'll lean right
Third gear, hang on tight
Faster, it's all right

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Everywhere I'm turning, nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching for the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow, slave to humanity
I wear it on my shoulders, gotta find strength in me
(Why is that?)

[Chorus]
Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes I am (Yes she is)
Still when I'm a mess, I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh, yes, I'm a Superwoman

[Verse 2]
(And this is for)
For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters coming together
Say "yes, I will," and "yes, I can"
(Why is that?)

[Chorus]
Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes I am (yes she is)
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a Superwoman

[Bridge]
When I'm breaking down and I can't be found
As I start to get weak
Cause no one knows me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, ooohh

[Chorus]
Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes I am (yes she is)
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a Superwoman (Yes she is)
Oh let me tell you I am Superwoman, yes I am (Yes she is)
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm Superwoman (Yes I am)
Said I'm a Superwoman (Yes she is)
Hey yeah, oh yeah

[Outro]
Yes I am, yeah (yes we are)
Yes I am
(Yes you are)
Starfleet to scoutship
Please give your position, over
I'm in orbit around the third planet
From the star called the Sun, over
May this be Earth? Over
Positive it is known
To have some form of intelligent species, over
I think we should take a look

Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains
I'd wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine

Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains
I'd wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine
Although your world wonders me
With your majestic superior cackling hen
Your people I do not understand
So to you I wish to put an end
And you'll never hear surf music again
Do not waste this evening
Baby I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my believe is something I'm gonna do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you
You got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only
Only heart
It's so hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you
You got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only
Only heart
And you live like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you, but there's a hole in the cup that should hold my love
Hold my love
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear, I never will
Remember, now you
You got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart
Yea, you got my only heart

[Verse 1]
You got me feelin' so lucky and I hope that you fuck me
I hope that you love me 'cause I probably do
Ain't that my fuckin' problem, man
These girls won't make you happy, happy

She said tell me something, a couple of stories
All the girls that broke me they were nothing like you
I guess I learned my lesson, got taught once
Don't be a fucking pussy, that's what she told me

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bop bop bop badap bop bop

[Verse 2]
I'm such a loser and my friends knew I'd lose her
I wake up with bruises 'cause now I'm a boozer
I had a lot of problems way before I knew her, I knew her
And I'm feeling so scummy, I hope that you call me
I'll tell everybody that I'm no longer lonely
You don't have to be crazy, you did that once
Don't be a fucking phony, that's what she told me

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop bop
Bop bop bop badap bop bop, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I know that it's wrong to love you for this long
Yes, that's on me
And I know that it's wrong to love you for this long
Guess that's on me

[Outro]
I know I'm wrong for loving you too long
I wrote you all these songs I'll never sing
Well, I know I'm wrong for loving you too long
For coming on too strong, girl, that's not me
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

People moving out
People moving in
Why, because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide

An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on

Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration, aggravation, humiliation
Obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

The sales of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky
The cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say, "More taxes will solve everything,"
And the band played on

So, round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows

Oh, Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live
Is on an Indian reservation
The band played on

Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war!"
And the band played on
Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a Ball Of Confusion
It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies

I will hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the innermost secrets we hide

I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise
I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll love you for the rest of my...
For the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I will roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside

[Verse 2]
You told me that I would find a home
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

[Chorus]
And darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see

[Post-Chorus]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say "That's exactly how this grace thing works"
It's not the long walk home that will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with every start

[Chorus]
Darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
Well, darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
Ahh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Stars hide your fires
For these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine

[Outro]
Thank you very much
Yeah, so this is our second night here. And to be honest with you, I was just nervous.  But tonight, um, I really wanna enjoy it, 'cause it's fun. And so far, you're very much helping with that, so thank you

[Verse 1]
Pour another glass of her warm smoke
Into the river and let it rest
'Til my thoughts get weary, until they float
I feel the smoke rising, all down my throat

[Verse 2]
Pour another glass of her warm smoke
Until I sleepwalk back home
With the stench of her perfume all on my coat
And yet another morning, I wake and I'm alone

[Bridge]
But I know oh oh oh oh oh oh
But I know oh oh oh oh oh oh
But I know oh oh oh oh oh oh
But I know oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Intrumental Outro]
Nobody knows except my pillow at night
All through the day how many tears I have to fight
Oh when I'm all alone yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
Oh I cry
I cry
Oh yeah

Nobody sees except my mirror on the wall
I'm not the fairest I'm the bluest of them all
And, Oh
When I'm all alone yeah
I just cry like a baby
I cry like a baby
I cry
I cry
Oh yeah

Each day I say tomorrow will be my lucky day
Ah ha yeah
And my pillow will be surprised when I come home with a glad eye
And the mirror on the wall will see that I am happy one more (?)
No more nights staring at daddy's chair
Because I know that you will be standing there
Oh oh, when I'm alone I won't

Cry like a baby
Cry like a baby

Oh yeah
Said I won't cry
I won't cry like a baby
Wooo hooo no
Oh ho yeah
I said that I ha
Xzibit: Goddamn. Hey, whassup, nigga?

Xzibit: Hey, hang that shit!
Someone else: What up, Dr. Dre?
Operator, can you help me?
Help me if you please
Give me the right area code
And the number that I need
My rider left upon the Midnight Flyer
Singing like a summer breeze
I think she's somewhere down south
Down about Baton Rouge
But I just can't remember no number
A number I can use, directory don't have it
Central done forgot it
Got to find a number to use
Trying to check out her number
Trying to run down her line
Operator said that's priviledged information
And it ain't no business of mine
It's flooding down in Texas, the poles are down in Utah
Got to find a private line
She could be hanging round a steel mill
Working in a house of blue light
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland
Talking to the night
I don't know where she's going
I don't care where she's been
Long as she's been doin' it right
Long as she's been doin' it right
Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real don't give me fake
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one cause one is best
In confusion confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik
And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

But give me love over, love over, love over this
And give me love over, love over, love over this
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

My feelings for you have always been real

Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century
Big wide hats and men is spats
At the turn of the century
With those horseless carriages
At the turn of the century
And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century
Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century, turn of the century
Peoples, peoples, peoples
You know what it means to be left alone
Peoples, peoples, people, (now hear me!)
You know what it means to be left alone
Yeah
Lord it happened to day
Lord not even a call on my telephone
Understandin'
Lord a little love, babe
In the world is all I need
A little love and understanding baby
It's all in the world I need
Lose of love
A misunderstanding of a no good woman
Lord they've both caused my heart to bleed
All right
Every mornin'
Every mornin' the willows weep among for me
Every mornin' yes the willows weep among for me
The birds sang the love song
My baby's caused my heart to bleed down
Every mornin', every mornin'
Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train, New York city - it rains!
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinkin' about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo - snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed!
I'm watching you this time
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
I missed that train
New York city - it rains!
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo - sno-ooows
Go to watch the show - curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind!

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
I missed that train, will you stand by me!
(Fly to east L.A.)
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
And if the world don't break!
All the lights aglow
(Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show, curtain's closed)
And when the seasons change, will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Verse 1]
See I met her at club on the Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seeing her coming my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her (oh-ooh)
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
She said no (oh-ohh)
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl
(I got that piper)
Bet you ain't never seen before
Saw around the world
I got them coming back for more

[Chorus]
And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care (oh-ooh)
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

[Verse 2]
Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hands trapped in the corner
Grinding slow, and I won't let go (no-ooh)
Baby more better than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona (oh-noo)
She probably let go (oh-ooh)
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said shes got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
Ill be coming right back for more

[Chorus]
And thats when I noticed
People are watching!
But we dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care (oh-ooh)
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

[Verse 3]
Im working your body
Like you are in my bedroom
YeahYeaUh-uhhYeahYeah
Everybody in the club got a clear view

[Chorus]
But that won't stop us
Cuz we dont care!
People are watching!
We dont care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we dont care
See you droppin and poppin
But we dont care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we dont care (oh-ooh)
See I bet youre nasty
When youre on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why Im losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

Snakes in the grass tryna police niggas
Say I'm living too large, I'm obese nigga

Life's short, you never know when it's your last one

You wanna hustle just know I supply the dealer
All you live in a jungle and you ain't a gorilla yea

And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'
Once upon a time, a long long time ago, wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery
And now you are standing on my doorstep, telling me how much you need me
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

How many times I begged for you to come home, but you laughed at me and said let me alone
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you, but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

Girl, I used to love you, placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
Girl, you can't come back here
Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time, when you went on your way
But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down
So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn right around
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Girl, you hurt me once
I hear you knockin'
Thirty days, Lord and thirty nights
I'm comin' home on an airplane flight
Mama waitin' at the ticket line
"Tell me son why do you stand there cryin'?"

It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away

I've been feelin' so sick inside
Got to get better, Lord before I die
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
"You better quit, son before you're dead"

Quit the needle, quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We're gonna take you away
Lord, we're gonna take you away

It was the needle and the spoon
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, lord I've seen a lot of fools
Well, I hope you people, Lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day

Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away

Lord, they're gonna bury Your boy
Don't mess with the needle
Now I know
Izabella girl I'm dream about ya every night
Hey girl you know we gotta war
Yeah, we got a war to fight
So I think about you every day
Oh, I hope you listen to me right

Izabella girl I'm fightin this war for you
Hey little girl I'm fightin' this war for the children of the world and you
So I hope you hear me baby
That what I'm tryin to tell you is true

[Guitar Solo]

Izabella I'm fighting this war for you
Hey, girl I'm fightin this war for the chlidren and you
Yeah, you save your love for me
Then I'll know that I'll be fightin' true

Izabella, hey Izabella
We've gotta fight this war against hatred

[Verse 1]
Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

[Chorus]
But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

[Verse 2]
Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer, hah
And Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm just flicking ash into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

[Chorus]
But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah (Hey yeah)
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Bridge]
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

[Middle 8]
Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

[Chorus]
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again
Haha, yeah
It's a lot of good cops out there
But this song is dedicated to the few bad ones
Haha, yeah
It's a lot of good cops out there
But this song is dedicated to the few bad ones

Police blow my wad

[Verse 1]
Whip Chamberlin call me Mr. Perfect
Shawty got an ass man her shape is gorgeous

Her earrings cost a fortune

Ain't no pussy I can't afford
Got a Chevy got a O's Hummer a Ford
She gorgeous, flawless
Baby you're perfect
Gucci Mane say I look better in person

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Big booty girls love ballin niggas
Every show I do my ego gets bigger
Every feature my bank row gets swoller
Polar bear pinkys man my fingers colder
Wanna be like Gucci when I grow older
A young man said like a boss suppose to
All dat ass girl you a poster

Shawty got a ass on her she bustin

Shawty got a swag but I got the hundreds
All dat ass man Im astounded

[Chorus]
Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there, nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me, Lord that this ol' boy just don't fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh
Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said, "Guilty"
I'm not one to complain, son I tell you true
(Tell the truth boy, tell the truth)
When the black cat cross your trail
Lord, it comes in misery times two
(Misery times two)
Double trouble, that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble, double trouble)
I said, "Double trouble"
T R O U B L E
(Double trouble)
Well I was born down in the gutter with a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a pea farm just doin' the county's time
Well now, even mama said, "Son you're bad news"
(Born to lose)
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you
Double trouble, that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble, double trouble)
I said, "Double trouble"
T R O U B L E
Double trouble, that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble, double trouble)
I said, "Double trouble"
T R O U B L E
Double double, trouble trouble
Double double, trouble trouble
Double double, trouble trouble
Double double, trouble trouble
When I looked on I never looked back
And baby you say I've gotta cope on the streets like a wrecking ball

If you know I was this way
Then you know I can never say
"I hope you'll be ok."

Girlfriend, I can't save your life again
Huh oh huh oh oh oh x2

Oh there's so little left in my life
That's why I go out at night
And you tell me every story
From the front to the back
To the back to the front
To the middle to the back
To the front
To the back
To the middle
To the back
Girlfriend, I can't save your life again
Huh oh huh oh oh oh x2

[Intro]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Sue me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kick me
Don't you black or white me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Bridge 1]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black male, blackmail
Throw your brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Bridge 2]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I do really hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Verse 5]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, kick me
Don't you wrong or right me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Slave driver the table is turned
Catch your fire so you can get burned, now
Slave driver the table is turned
Catch your fire, you're gonna get burned

Every time I hear the crack of the whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalized our very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good god, I think it's illiteracy
It's only machine that make money

Slave driver the table is turned

Slave driver the table is turned baby now
Catch a fire so you can get burned baby now
Slave driver the table is turned
Catch your fire so you can get burned
Every time I hear the crack of the whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalized our very souls

Oh god have mercy on our souls
Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight
I'd like to introduce, Mr. Hahn
Let's hear it for the great Mr. Hahn
And now for a lesson in rhythm management
Let's begin, alright now, wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else, else, else, else

[AMNERIS]
In life, one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
There's health, and fitness, diet, and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice
Conversation? Wit? I am a doubter
Manners? Charm? They're no way to impress
So forget the inner me, observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress

Oh, now I believe in lookin'
Like my time on earth is cookin'
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fiber on of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect

From your cradle via trousseau
To your deathbed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
For my dress has always been...my strongest suit
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)

Staying in or hitting town-wards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time (Is stitched in time)
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously is a crime (It's such a crime)

And the few who are invited (Overwear)
To my wardrobe are delighted (Underwear)
As they wander through my things (Anytime)
To find en route (We're wandering through your things)
That in negligee or formal (Negligee)
I am anything but normal (Anything but normal)
And dress has always been my strongest suit

(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I am what I wear
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
I said anytime...
(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)
Anywhere

So bring me all my finest (Finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
(Most arresting) Most arresting
(Most heartstopping) Most heartstopping
Most free-flowing (Overwear)
Most eye-popping (Underwear)
Most arresting (Anytime)
Most heartstopping, yeah (Anywhere)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!
(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear
(I am what I wear)
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

So bring me all my finest (My finest)
Most audacious, my divinest (Divinest)
Most revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)
Most arresting, most heartstopping
Most free-flowing, most eye-popping
Dress has always been my strongest suit!

(I am what I wear)
My strongest suit
(I am what I wear)
You know that I am what I wear
Dress has always been my strongest
My strongest, my strongest
My strongest, my strongest
My strongest suit!
River's strong you can't
Swim inside it we could
String some lights up the, hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could
You could drive with your headlights out
'Cause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
Don't get up just to, get another you can
Drink from mine, we can't, leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you want to get older with me
'Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like a wildfire
I got a rock from the river in my medicine bag
Magpie feather in his medicine bag
Say, say, say
Ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catchin' on like a wildfire
Now Shawty girl you like bail money
When I’m like down in the jail, honey
You set me free and I need that
The other half of me girl you be that
And girl I need for you to know this
See I’ma keep you warm in the coldest
Weather you can dream of
Baby you’re my dream love
The other couples trim us

[Chorus]
Do you understand just what you are to me, girl
Baby you’re the air I breathe
Baby you’re my everything, so listen to me
I need you to survive, I can’t lie
Girl I won’t ride, without you by my side
The most important part of my life is you, girl

Now let me tell you what the deal is
See baby you that girl and you the realest
Girl it ain’t none of this new to you
You say you gotta go, I move with you
Everything I loose, if you leave I’ll be a damn shame
Cause girl what’s left for me it’s not a damn thang
And lady I want you to know that
I’m giving you my heart, so baby hold that

[Chorus]
Do you understand just what you are to me, girl
Baby you’re the air I breathe
Baby you’re my everything, so listen to me
I need you to survive, I can’t lie
Girl I won’t ride, without you by my side
The most important part of my life is you, girl

It’s like the bottom of the night …
And girl I’m trying to hit a home run
I’m in the game with you I’m trying to win it
And I refuse to be alone, yeah
And I ain’t never gonna let you go
Cause you’re the most important part of my life
Girl, do you know, whoa, do you understand

[Chorus] X 2
Do you understand just what you are to me, girl
Baby you’re the air I breathe
Baby you’re my everything, so listen to me
I need you to survive, I can’t lie
Girl I won’t ride, without you by my side
The most important part of my life is you, girl
Could you, could you come back?
Come back together
Put yourself on my back
And say it's forever
Could you, could you come home?
Come home forever
Your shoulders knees and your back
Will keep us together

'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ahhhh, ahhhh

Could you, could you come on?
Could you tell me whatever?
Tie yourself to a mast?
It's now or it's never
Gonna tear us apart
Tell me forever
It's gonna tear us apart
Keep us together
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Ahhh, ahhh
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
You're the one I love
Don't wanna let you go, I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes and let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by

I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever, be apart never
That's alright with me
I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

[Instrumental]

Don't wanna let you go, I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes and let this night pass me by
Won't let it pass me by

I don't wanna miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever, be apart never
That's alright with me

Your love is so amazing

[Verse 1]
He came, she smiled
She thought she had him tamed
But he was just as wild
Eating from her hand at last

[Chorus]
Wild things run fast

[Verse 2]
In the dark he could see
The trap that was lying
In her sweet company
Eating from her hand at last

[Chorus]
Wild things run fast

[Bridge]
Winter beat the pines about
He heard the heater
Cutting in and out
While she dreamed away

[Verse 3]
In the night, it snowed
Fast tracks in the powder white
Leading out to the road
Winding from her tender grasp

[Chorus]
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast

[Outro]
What makes you run?
Wild thing, I thought you loved me

[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again
Yeah!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Vese 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be
Yep!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Outro]
Thank you

You took your love from me (Ooh)

A wound that will never heal, oh

Why did you take your love from me? (Operation, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, give it up
'Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey
Shittin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me out
'Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
'Til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad that you came

[Chorus]
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm wanna get you wet
Tell-Tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet, wet
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm wanna get you wet
Tell-Tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet, wet

[Verse 2]
Can you, can you get me up?
Like I'm late for the first class
So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Fold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper, babe
But fuck them dollar bills
Girl, I'll make it rain
Holiday Inn
Come meet me on my 8th floor
Damn, it feels good but I feel bad for them maids, though
And I, and I–I–I apologize
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n' slide

[Chorus]
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm wanna get you wet
Tell-Tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet, wet
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm wann
